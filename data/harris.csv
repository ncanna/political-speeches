thank the people of Iowa because ever since the first trip I played here as a presidential candidate you have been informing and helping me be a better candidate and you undoubtedly will help me be a better president so I want to thank you in fact one of the first meetings I had was a meeting with a group of teachers here and and and and and that during that meeting you said to me hey Connolly you know this issue of teacher pay you've been talking about it's a national issue and it was because of the conversation that we had that as my first policy proposal I am prepared to make the first federal investment in the history of our country in closing that teacher pay gap I thank you and so that's just that's part of the backbone part of the backbone of what I believe needs to be done right now which is to make the case for America make the case for our America and America where health care is a right not a privilege America where teachers are paid their value and America where women have the right to make decisions about their own bodies and America where somebody has to work only one job to put food on the table and a roof over their head and America where our children do not have to go to school every day and be concerned about some mass shooter roaming the hallways of their school and America where we have a president of the United States who knows it is a sign of strength not to beat people down but to lift people up so I like to tell you a little bit about my background so I was raised as a child as a daughter of the civil rights movement my parents met when they were active in that movement my sister and I joked that we grew up surrounded by a bunch of adults who spent full time marching and shouting in fact our mother was all a 5 feet tall if you had ever met her you would have thought she was 7 feet tall and my mother was the kind of person who if you ever came home complaining about something the first thing she do she might put a hand on her hip she look at you and she'd say so what are you going to do about it so I decided to run for president of the United States and tell you about my background it's um I spent a career as a prosecutor and prey on the most vulnerable murderers and rapists i prosecuted banks i prosecuted big pharmaceutical companies who were preying on the most vulnerable and consumers i prosecuted the big banks and for-profit colleges who were defrauding homeowners and consumers and i'm gonna tell you somebody else who has defrauded the american people Donald Trump he promised the American people that he would take care of dreamers he would protect up working people but what did we get instead we got a President of the United States who made a whole lot of promises and betrayed the American people what did we get a lot of broken promises so we need to prosecute the case and I want to tell you there's a rap sheet full of evidence to make the case let's look at what happened he promised health care and then he tried to rip health care away from millions of people what's that called health care fraud he said he was for working people then he passed a tax bill benefiting the top one percent and the biggest corporations in this country that's tax fraud he believes the President of Russia and a North Korean dictator over the word of the American intelligence community securities fraud and then he claims to be the best president we've seen in a generation well I say let's call Barack Obama because that's identity fraud so I'm here to ask for your support I'm here to ask for your support cuz I

65,hHYIWW5n5Rg,harris,2020-08-12T22:17:49Z,Democratic VP candidate Kamala Harris speaks at Joe Biden event,speech,thank you joe thank you thank you joe as i said joe when you called me i am incredibly honored by this responsibility and i'm ready to get to work i am ready to get to work after the most competitive primary in history the country received a resounding message that joe was the person to lead us forward and joe i'm so proud to stand with you and i do so mindful of all the heroic and ambitious women before me whose sacrifice determination and resilience makes my presence here today even possible this is a moment of real consequence for america everything we care about our economy our health our children the kind of country we live in it's all on the line we're reeling from the worst public health crisis in a century the president's mismanagement of the pandemic has plunged us into the worst economic crisis since the great depression and we're experiencing a moral reckoning with racism and systemic injustice that has brought a new coalition of conscience to the streets of our country demanding change america is crying out for leadership yet we have a president who cares more about himself than the people who elected him a president who is making every challenge we face even more difficult to solve but here's the good news we don't have to accept the failed government of donald trump and mike pence in just 83 days we have a chance to choose a better future for our country so joe dr biden thank you for the trust you've placed in me jill i know you will be an incredible first lady and my husband doug and i are so grateful grateful to become a part of your extended family and ever since i received joe's call i've been thinking yes about the first biden that i really came to know and that of course is joe's beloved son one of his beloved sons beau in the midst of the great recession bo and i spoke on the phone practically every day sometimes multiple times a day working together to win back billions of dollars for homeowners from the big banks of the nation that were foreclosing on people's homes and let me just tell you about bo biden i learned quickly that beau was the kind of guy who inspired people to be a better version of themselves he really was the best of us and when i would ask him where'd you get that where'd this come from he'd always talk about his dad and i will tell you the love that they shared was incredible to watch it was the most beautiful display of the love between a father and a son and beau talked about how joe would spend four hours every day riding the rails back and forth from wilmington to washington so he can make breakfast for his kids in the morning and make it home in time to tuck them in bed each night all of this so two little boys who had just lost their mom and their sister in a tragic accident would know that the world was still turning and that's how i came to know joe he's someone whose first response when things get tough is never to think about himself but to care for everyone else he's someone who never asks why is this happening to me and instead asks what can i do to make life better for you his empathy his compassion his sense of duty to care for others is why i am so proud to be on this ticket and joe and i yes we are cut from the same cloth family is everything to me too and i cannot wait for america to get to know my husband doug and our amazing kids cole and ella because whether i'm cheering in the bleachers at a swim meet or setting up a college room dorm or helping my goddaughter prepare for her school debate or building legos with my godson or hugging my two baby nieces or cooking dinner sunday dinner my family means everything to me and i've had a lot of titles over my career and certainly vice president will be great but mamala will always be the one that means the most and you know my mother and father they came from opposite sides of the world to arrive in america one from india and the other from jamaica in search of a world-class education but what brought them together was the civil rights movement of the nineteen sixties and that's how they met as students in the streets of oakland marching and shouting for this thing called justice in a struggle that continues today and i was part of it my parents would bring me to protest strapped tightly in my stroller and my mother shamala raised my sister maya and me to believe that it was up to us and every generation of americans to keep on marching she tell us don't sit around and complain about things do something so i did something i devoted my life to making real the words carved in the united states supreme court equal justice under law and 30 years ago i stood before a judge for the first time breathed deep and uttered the phrase that would that would truly guide my career and the rest of my career kamala harris for the people the people that's who i represented as district attorney fighting on behalf of victims who needed help the people that's who i fought for as california's attorney general when i took on transnational criminal organizations who traffic in guns and drugs and human beings and it's the people who i have fought for as a united states senator where i've worked every day to hold trump officials accountable to the american people and the people are who joe and i will fight for every day in the white house and let me tell you somebody who has presented my fair share of arguments in court the case against donald trump and mike pence is open and shut just look where they've gotten us more than 16 million out of work millions of kids who cannot go back to school a crisis of poverty of homelessness afflicting black brown and indigenous people the most a crisis of hunger afflicting one in five mothers who have children that are hungry and tragically more than a hundred and sixty five thousand lives that have been cut short many with loved ones who never got the chance to say goodbye it didn't have to be this way six years ago in fact we had a different health crisis it was called ebola and we all remember that pandemic but you know what happened then barack obama and joe biden did their job only two people in the united states died two that is what's called leadership but compare that to the moment we find ourselves in now when other countries are following the science trump pushed miracle cures he saw on fox news while other countries were flattening the curve he said the vice would just poof go away quote like a miracle so when other countries opened back up for business what did we do we had to shut down again this virus has impacted almost every country but there's a reason it has hit america worse than any other advanced nation it's because of trump's failure to take it seriously from the his refusal to get testing up and running his flip-flopping on social distancing and wearing masks his delusional belief that he knows better than the experts all of that is reason and the reason that an american dies of covid19 every 80 seconds it's why countless businesses have had to shut their doors for good it's why there is complete chaos over when and how to reopen our schools mothers and fathers are confused and uncertain and angry about child care and the safety of their kids at school whether they'll be in danger if they go or fall behind if they don't trump is also the reason millions of americans are now unemployed he inherited the longest economic expansion in history from barack obama and joe biden and then like everything else he inherited he ran it straight into the ground because of trump's failures of leadership our economy has taken one of the biggest hits out of all the major industrialized nations with an unemployment rate that has tripled as of today this is what happens when we elect a guy who just isn't up for the job our country ends up in tatters and so does our reputation around the world but let's be clear this election isn't just about defeating donald trump or mike pence it's about building this country back better and that's exactly what joe and i will do we'll create millions of jobs and fight climate change through a clean energy revolution bring back critical supply chains so the future is made in america build on the affordable care act so everyone has the peace of mind that comes with health insurance and finally offer caregivers the dignity the respect and the pay they deserve will protect a woman's right to make her own decisions about her own body root out systemic racism in our justice system and pass a new voting rights act a john lewis voting rights act that will ensure every voice is heard and every voice is counted the civil rights struggle is nothing new to joe it's why he got into public service it's why he helped reauthorize the voting rights act and restore unemployment discrimination and employment discrimination laws and today he takes his place in the ongoing story of america's march toward equality and justice as only as the only as the only who has served alongside the first black president and has chosen the first black woman as his running mate but as joe always points out this election is about more than politics it's about who we are as a country and i'll admit over the past four years there have been moments when i have truly worried about our future but whenever i that there is a reason for doubt whenever i've had my own doubts i think of you the american people the doctors and nurses and front-line workers who are risking your lives to save others the truck drivers and the workers in grocery stores in factories and farms working there putting your own safety on the line to help us get through this pandemic the women and students taking to the streets in unprecedented numbers the dreamers and immigrants who know that families belong together the lgbtq americans who know that love is love people of every age and color and creed who are finally declaring in one voice that yes black lives matter all across this country a whole new generation of children is growing up hearing the cries for justice and the chance of hope on which i was raised some strapped into strollers of their own and trust me it's a song you'll never forget so to everyone keeping up the fight you are doing something you are doing something great you are the heroes of our time and you are the reason i know we are going to bring our country closer to realizing its great promise but to do it we'll need to work organize and vote like never before because we need more than a victory on november third we need a mandate that proves that the past few years do not represent who we are or who we aspire to be joe likes to say that character is on the ballot and it's true when he saw what happened in charlottesville three years ago today he knew we were in a battle for the soul of our nation and together with your help that's a battle we will win earlier this year i said i do whatever joe asked me to do and so now i'm asking you to do the same so visit joebiden.com to get involved in this campaign and vote because electing joe biden is just the start of the work ahead of us and i couldn't be prouder to be by his side running to represent you the people thank you and may god bless the united states of america you,b thank PRON joe thank PRON thank PRON joe as i say joe when PRON call PRON i be incredibly honor by this responsibility and PRON be ready to get to work i be ready to get

70,JijFLcbIqMs,harris,2020-08-20T03:41:13Z,WATCH: Kamala Harrisâ€™ full speech at the 2020 Democratic National Convention | 2020 DNC Night 3,speech,"Greetings America. It is truly an honor to be speaking with you. That I am here tonight is a testament to the
dedication of generations before me. Women and men who believed so fiercely in
the promise of equality, liberty, and justice for all. This week marks the 100th anniversary of the
passage of the 19th amendment. And we celebrate the women who fought for
that right. Yet so many of the Black women who helped
secure that victory were still prohibited from voting, long after its ratification. But they were undeterred. Without fanfare or recognition, they organized,
testified, rallied, marched, and foughtâ€”not just for their vote, but for a seat at the
table. These women and the generations that followed
worked to make democracy and opportunity real in the lives of all of us who followed. They paved the way for the trailblazing leadership
of Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton. And these women inspired us to pick up the
torch, and fight on. Women like Mary Church Terrell and Mary McCleod
Bethune. Fannie Lou Hamer and Diane Nash. Constance Baker Motley and Shirley Chisholm. We're not often taught their stories. But as Americans, we all stand on their shoulders. There's another woman, whose name isn't known,
whose story isn't shared. Another woman whose shoulders I stand on. And that's my motherâ€”Shyamala Gopalan Harris. She came here from India at age 19 to pursue
her dream of curing cancer. At the University of California Berkeley,
she met my father, Donald Harrisâ€”who had come from Jamaica to study economics. They fell in love in that most American wayâ€”while
marching together for justice in the civil rights movement of the 1960s. In the streets of Oakland and Berkeley, I
got a stroller's-eye view of people getting into what the great John Lewis called ""good
trouble."" When I was 5, my parents split and my mother
raised us mostly on her own. Like so many mothers, she worked around the
clock to make it workâ€”packing lunches before we woke upâ€” and paying bills after we went
to bed. Helping us with homework at the kitchen tableâ€”and
shuttling us to church for choir practice. She made it look easy, though I know it never
was. My mother instilled in my sister, Maya, and
me the values that would chart the course of our lives. She raised us to be proud, strong Black women. And she raised us to know and be proud of
our Indian heritage. She taught us to put family firstâ€”the family
you're born into and the family you choose. Family, is my husband Doug, who I met on a
blind date set up by my best friend. Family is our beautiful children, Cole and
Ella, who as you just heard, call me Momala. Family is my sister. Family is my best friend, my nieces and my
godchildren. Family is my uncles, my auntsâ€”my chitthis. Family is Mrs. Sheltonâ€”my second mother
who lived two doors down and helped raise me. Family is my beloved Alpha Kappa Alpha...our
Divine 9...and my HBCU brothers and sisters. Family is the friends I turned to when my
motherâ€”the most important person in my lifeâ€”passed away from cancer. And even as she taught us to keep our family
at the center of our world, she also pushed us to see a world beyond ourselves. She taught us to be conscious and compassionate
about the struggles of all people. To believe public service is a noble cause
and the fight for justice is a shared responsibility. That led me to become a lawyer, a District
Attorney, Attorney General, and a United States Senator. And at every step of the way, I've been guided
by the words I spoke from the first time I stood in a courtroom: Kamala Harris, For the
People. I've fought for children, and survivors of
sexual assault. I've fought against transnational gangs. I took on the biggest banks, and helped take
down one of the biggest for-profit colleges. I know a predator when I see one. My mother taught me that service to others
gives life purpose and meaning. And oh, how I wish she were here tonight but
I know she's looking down on me from above. I keep thinking about that 25-year-old Indian
womanâ€”all of five feet tallâ€”who gave birth to me at Kaiser Hospital in Oakland, California. On that day, she probably could have never
imagined that I would be standing before you now speaking these words: I accept your nomination
for Vice President of the United States of America. I do so, committed to the values she taught
me. To the Word that teaches me to walk by faith,
and not by sight. And to a vision passed on through generations
of Americansâ€”one that Joe Biden shares. A vision of our nation as a Beloved Communityâ€”where
all are welcome, no matter what we look like, where we come from, or who we love. A country where we may not agree on every
detail, but we are united by the fundamental belief that every human being is of infinite
worth, deserving of compassion, dignity and respect. A country where we look out for one another,
where we rise and fall as one, where we face our challenges, and celebrate our triumphsâ€”together. Today... that country feels distant. Donald Trump's failure of leadership has cost
lives and livelihoods. If you're a parent struggling with your child's
remote learning, or you're a teacher struggling on the other side of that screen, you know
that what we're doing right now isn't working. And we are a nation that's grieving. Grieving the loss of life, the loss of jobs,
the loss of opportunities, the loss of normalcy. And yes, the loss of certainty. And while this virus touches us all, let's
be honest, it is not an equal opportunity offender. Black, Latino and Indigenous people are suffering
and dying disproportionately. This is not a coincidence. It is the effect of structural racism. Of inequities in education and technology,
health care and housing, job security and transportation. The injustice in reproductive and maternal
health care. In the excessive use of force by police. And in our broader criminal justice system. This virus has no eyes, and yet it knows exactly
how we see each otherâ€”and how we treat each other. And let's be clearâ€”there is no vaccine for
racism. We've gotta do the work. For George Floyd. For Breonna Taylor. For the lives of too many others to name. For our children. For all of us. We've gotta do the work to fulfill that promise
of equal justice under law. Because, none of us are free...until all of
us are free... We're at an inflection point. The constant chaos leaves us adrift. The incompetence makes us feel afraid. The callousness makes us feel alone. It's a lot. And here's the thing: We can do better and
deserve so much more. We must elect a president who will bring something
different, something better, and do the important work. A president who will bring all of us togetherâ€”Black,
White, Latino, Asian, Indigenousâ€”to achieve the future we collectively want. We must elect Joe Biden. I knew Joe as Vice President. I knew Joe on the campaign trail. But I first got to know Joe as the father
of my friend. Joe's son, Beau, and I served as Attorneys
General of our states, Delaware and California. During the Great Recession, we spoke on the
phone nearly every day, working together to win back billions of dollars for homeowners
from the big banks that foreclosed on people's homes. And Beau and I would talk about his family. How, as a single father, Joe would spend 4
hours every day riding the train back and forth from Wilmington to Washington. Beau and Hunter got to have breakfast every
morning with their dad. They went to sleep every night with the sound
of his voice reading bedtime stories. And while they endured an unspeakable loss,
these two little boys Always knew that they were deeply, unconditionally loved. And what also moved me about Joe is the work
he did, as he went back and forth. This is the leader who wrote the Violence
Against Women Actâ€”and enacted the Assault Weapons Ban. Who, as Vice President, implemented The Recovery
Act, which brought our country back from The Great Recession. He championed The Affordable Care Act, protecting
millions of Americans with pre-existing conditions. Who spent decades promoting American values
and interests around the world, standing up with our allies and standing up to our adversaries. Right now, we have a president who turns our
tragedies into political weapons. Joe will be a president who turns our challenges
into purpose. Joe will bring us together to build an economy
that doesn't leave anyone behind. Where a good-paying job is the floor, not
the ceiling. Joe will bring us together to end this pandemic
and make sure that we are prepared for the next one. Joe will bring us together to squarely face
and dismantle racial injustice, furthering the work of
generations. Joe and I believe that we can build that Beloved
Community, one that is strong and decent, just and kind. One in which we all can see ourselves. That's the vision that our parents and grandparents
fought for. The vision that made my own life possible. The vision that makes the American promiseâ€”for
all its complexities and imperfectionsâ€”a promise worth fighting for. Make no mistake, the road ahead will not be
not easy. We will stumble. We may fall short. But I pledge to you that we will act boldly
and deal with our challenges honestly. We will speak truths. And we will act with the same faith in you
that we ask you to place in us. We believe that our countryâ€”all of us, will
stand together for a better future. We already are. We see it in the doctors, the nurses, the
home health care workers and the frontline workers who are risking their lives to save
people they've never met. We see it in the teachers and truck drivers,
the factory workers and farmers, the postal workers and the Poll workers, all putting
their own safety on the line to help us get through this pandemic. And we see it in so many of you who are working,
not just to get us through our current crises, but to somewhere better. There's something happening, all across the
country. It's not about Joe or me. It's about you. It's about us. People of all ages and colors and creeds who
are, yes, taking to the streets, and also persuading our family members, rallying our
friends, organizing our neighbors, and getting out the vote. And we've shown that, when we vote, we expand
access to health care, expand access to the ballot box, and ensure that more working families
can make a decent living. I'm inspired by a new generation of leadership. You are pushing us to realize the ideals of
our nation, pushing us to live the values we share: decency and fairness, justice and
love. You are the patriots who remind us that to
love our country is to fight for the ideals of our country. In this election, we have a chance to change
the course of history. We're all in this fight. You, me, and Joeâ€”together. What an awesome responsibility. What an awesome privilege. So, let's fight with conviction. Let's fight with hope. Let's fight with confidence in ourselves,
and a commitment to each other. To the America we know is possible. The America, we love. Years from now, this moment will have passed. And our children and our grandchildren will
look in our eyes and ask us: Where were you when the stakes were so high? They will ask us, what was it like? And we will tell them. We will tell them, not just how we felt. We will tell them what we did. Thank you. God bless you. And God bless the United States of America.",b greetings america PRON be truly an honor to be speak with PRON that i be here tonight be a testament to the ndedication of generation before PRON woman

73,Og8PLfNwNOw,harris,2020-08-27T19:30:31Z,Kamala Harris to discuss Trump's response to coronavirus,speech,D AFTERNOON. ON THE EVE OF THE FIFTY SEVENTH MARCH ON WASHINGTON I WILL SPEAK ABOUT THE RECENT EVENTS AND CONDUCT WISCONSIN. THE WILDFIRES RAGING ACROSS THE CALIFORNIA COAST TO THE ROCKY MOUNTAINS. THE STORM WHICH IS WORKING ITS WAY THROUGH TEXAS LOUISIANA AND THE GULF COAST. AND MOST OF ALL ABOUT WHO WE ARE AS A COUNTRY. WE ARE A NATION THAT AT ITS BEST LOVES PROTECTS AND HELPS OUR FELLOW AMERICANS. TODAY WE SEE PAIN HURT AND DESTRUCTION IN THE ASHES OF WILDFIRES IN THE DAMAGE OF HURRICANE LAURA. WE ENCOURAGE EVERYONE TO CONTINUE FOLLOWING GUIDANCE FROM YOUR LOCAL AUTHORITIES TO STAY SAFE AND JOHN I PLEDGE TO BE THERE FOR THOSE WHOSE LIVES HAVE BEEN TURNED UPSIDE DOWN. THOSE WILL NEED HELP FROM NEIGHBORS STRANGERS AND OUR GOVERNMENT TO MAKE IT THROUGH. TO BUILD BACK TO RESTORE YOUR LINES AND YOUR COMMUNITIES. WE ALSO SEE PAIN HURT AND DESTRUCTION IN THE AFTERMATH OF YET ANOTHER BLACK MAN SHOT BY POLICE. JACOB BLAKE SHOT SEVEN TIMES IN THE BACK. IN BROAD DAYLIGHT IN FRONT OF HIS THREE YOUNG SONS. SEVEN TIMES IN THE BACK IN BROAD DAYLIGHT IN FRONT OF HIS THREE YOUNG SONS. AS VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN PUT IT THE SHOTS FIRED AT MR BLAKE PIERCED THE SOUL OF OUR NATION. IT'S SICKENING TO WATCH. IT'S ALL TOO FAMILIAR. AND IT MUST END. THANKFULLY HE IS ALIVE TODAY BUT HE IS FIGHTING FOR HIS LIFE AND HE SHOULDN'T HAVE TO BE. MY HEART GOES OUT TO THE BLACK FAMILY AS THEY INDOOR AN ORDEAL THAT IS TRAGICALLY COMMON IN OUR COUNTRY. JOHN I SPOKE WITH THEM YESTERDAY. THEY ARE AND- GROUP OF PEOPLE WITH EXTRAORDINARY COURAGE EVEN IN THEIR PAIN AND THEIR GRIEF EVEN AS THEY SEEK JUSTICE FOR THEIR SON. THEY SPOKE ABOUT THE NEED TO END THE VIOLENCE AND HEAL OUR NATION. I'VE HAD CONVERSATIONS LIKE THIS WITH FAR TOO MANY MOTHERS AND FATHERS. BUT YOU WILL SEE AND HEAR NO ONE WITH MORE COURAGE MORE CHARACTER AND MORE MORAL CLARITY. PEOPLE ARE RIGHTFULLY ANGRY AND EXHAUSTED AND AFTER THE MURDERS OF BRIANNA IN GEORGE AND AMAL LEFT AND SO MANY OTHERS IT'S NO WONDER PEOPLE ARE TAKEN TO THE STREETS. AND I SUPPORT THEM. WE MUST ALWAYS DEFEND PEACEFUL PROTEST AND PEACEFUL PROTESTERS. WE SHOULD NOT CONFUSE THEM WITH THOSE LOOTING AND COMMITTING ACTS OF VIOLENCE INCLUDING THE SHOOTER WHO WAS ARRESTED FOR MURDER. AND MAKE NO MISTAKE WE WILL NOT LET THESE VIGILANTE IS AN EXTREMIST. DERAIL THE PATH TO JUSTICE. HERE'S MY PROMISE TO THOSE MOTHERS AND FATHERS AND ALL WHO STAND WITH THEM. IN A BIDEN HERIS ADMINISTRATION YOU WILL HAVE A SEAT AT THE TABLE. IN THE HALLS OF CONGRESS AND IN THE WHITE HOUSE. WE ALL GREW UP RECITING THE PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE. BUT NOW. WE MUST GIVE REAL MEANING TO ITS WORDS. ONE NATION UNDER GOD INDIVISIBLE WITH LIBERTY AND JUSTICE FOR ALL. JUSTICE LET'S TALK ABOUT THEM. BECAUSE THE REALITY IS THAT THE LIFE OF A BLACK PERSON IN AMERICA HAS NEVER BEEN TREATED AS FULLY HUMAN. AND WE HAVE YET TO FULFILL THAT PROMISE. OF EQUAL JUSTICE UNDER LAW. WE WILL ONLY ACHIEVE THAT WHEN WE FINALLY COME TOGETHER TO PASS MEANINGFUL POLICE REFORM AND BROADER CRIMINAL JUSTICE REFORM AND ACKNOWLEDGE. YES IT KNOWLEDGE AND ADDRESS SYSTEMIC RACISM. WE WILL ONLY COME CLOSER TO ACHIEVING THAT WHEN WE FINALLY COME TOGETHER. WE HAVE COME A LONG WAY IN OUR COUNTRY TOWARDS BUILDING A MORE PERFECT UNION. AND THE TIME IS NOW RIGHT NOW. TO TAKE THE NEXT STEP FORWARD. AND EVEN AS WE EXPERIENCE THIS RECKONING WITH RACIAL INJUSTICE WE MUST ALSO CONFRONT ANOTHER CRISIS. THE PANDEMIC THAT HAS TORN APART SO MANY LINES. THE NUMBERS THAT DEFINED THIS CRISIS ARE STAGGERING. WE CANNOT LOOK THE OTHER WAY OR ALLOW OURSELVES TO BECOME NUMB TO THEM. NEARLY SIX MILLION CONFIRMED CASES. OF THE CORONAVIRUS ONE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY THOUSAND LIVES LOST MORE THAN FIFTY MILLION CLAIMS FOR UNEMPLOYMENT THIS YEAR ALONE. WE NEED TO SEE AND WE NEED TO HEAR WHAT IS HAPPENING IN OUR COUNTRY. THE QUIET DESPERATION THAT HAS TAKEN OVER SO MANY LIVES IN AMERICA. THE FAMILY PACKING INTO THEIR CAR AT FIVE O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING HOPING THE LOCAL FOOD BANK STILL HAS SOMETHING LEFT WHEN THEY GET TO THE FRONT OF THE LINE. THE FIFTY YEAR OLD STORE MANAGER. WAS BEEN LAID OFF AND KNOWS HE CAN'T PAY THE RENT ON THE FIRST OF THE MONTH. THE MOTHERS AND FATHERS STRETCHED TO THE BREAKING POINT WORKING FROM HOME WHILE HELPING THEIR KIDS WITH THEIR ONLINE CLASSES. JUST TRYING TO HOLD IT ALL TOGETHER. THE SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS ECONOMIC ENGINES OF OUR COMMUNITIES WHO ARE SHUTTING THEIR DOORS EVERY DAY. THE NURSE GETTING READY FOR HER AFTERNOON SHIFT WHO HAS SEEN SO MUCH SUFFERING AND DEATH IN RECENT MONTHS AND WONDERS HOW MUCH MORE CAN SHE BEAR TO WITNESS. THE FAMILY GRIEVING THE LOSS OF THEIR GRANDMOTHER. WHO'S BEEN IN A NURSING HOME AND WHO THEY COULDN'T EVEN VISIT OVER THE LAST THREE MONTHS OF HER LIFE. THE ALARMING AND DISPROPORTIONATE RATE. AT WHICH BLACK LATINO INDEED AN INDIGENOUS FAMILIES ARE CONTRACTING AND DYING OF COVID NINETEEN. THAT IS THE REALITY OF AMERICA RIGHT NOW. A REALITY COMPLETELY ABSENT FROM THIS WEEK'S REPUBLICAN NATIONAL CONVENTION. BECAUSE UNLIKE THE DEMOCRATIC CONVENTION WHICH WAS VERY CLEAR EYED ABOUT THE CHALLENGES WE ARE FACING AND HOW WE WILL TACKLE THEM. THE REPUBLICAN CONVENTION IS DESIGNED FOR ONE PURPOSE. TO SUE DONALD TRUMP'S EGO. TO MAKE HIM FEEL GOOD. BUT HERE'S THE THING. HE'S THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. AND IT'S NOT SUPPOSED TO BE ABOUT HIM. IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE ABOUT THE HEALTH AND THE SAFETY AND THE WELL BEING OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. AND ON THAT MEASURE DONALD TRUMP HAS FAILED. YOU SEE AT ITS MOST BASIC LEVEL. DONALD TRUMP DOESN'T UNDERSTAND THE PRESIDENCY. HE THINKS IT'S ALL ABOUT HIM. WELL IT'S NOT IT'S ABOUT YOU. IT'S ABOUT ALL OF US. THE PEOPLE. AS A LAWYER AND ADVOCATE WHEN I WOULD RISE TO SPEAK IN THE COURT ROOM I'D SAY THE FOLLOWING WORDS. KAMILLA HARRIS FOR THE PEOPLE. AND THAT IS WHY I STAND TODAY TO SPEAK FOR THE PEOPLE. BECAUSE WE KNOW THE TRUTH. DONALD TRUMP HAS FAILED AT THE MOST BASIC AND IMPORTANT JOB OF A PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. HE FAILED TO PROTECT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. PLAIN AND SIMPLE TRUMP SHOWED THAT WE IN THE LEGAL PROFESSION WOULD CALL A RECKLESS DISREGARD FOR THE WELL BEING OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. A RECKLESS DISREGARD FOR THE DANGER OF PANDEMIC WOULD POSE TO AMERICAN LINES. FOR THE DEVASTATION IT WOULD DO TO OUR ECONOMY. BUT THE DAMAGE IT WOULD DO TO COMMUNITIES OF COLOR WHO HAVE BEEN SUBJECTED TO STRUCTURAL RACISM FOR GENERATIONS. THE CHAOS THAT WOULD UPEND OUR DAILY LINES MAKE IT IMPOSSIBLE FOR MANY OF OUR CHILDREN TO GO TO SCHOOL. MAKE IT IMPOSSIBLE TO LIVE NORMALLY AND WITH THE SENSE OF CERTAINTY. HE NEVER APPRECIATED AT A PRESIDENT SWEARS AN OATH BEFORE GOD AND COUNTRY TO PROTECT AMERICA AGAINST THREATS SEEN AND UNSEEN. IT'S HIS DUTY. IT'S A OUR OBLIGATION TO PROTECT US. AND YET HE HAS FAILED. MISERABLY. HERE'S THE THING. DONALD TRUMP'S INCOMPETENCE IS NOTHING NEW. THAT HAS ALWAYS BEEN ON FULL DISPLAY. BUT IN JANUARY OF THIS YEAR IT BECAME DEADLY. THAT'S WHEN THE THREAT OF A VIRUS THAT IT WOULD ENDANGER THE WORLD'S FIRST EMERGED. TRUMP DISMISSED THE THREAT. BUT JOE BIDEN SOUND THE ALARM. IT WOULD BE THE BEGINNING OF A PATTERN THAT PERSIST TO THIS DAY. TRUMP TELLING US NOT TO WORRY THAT THE VIRUS WILL QUOTE DISAPPEAR THAT A QUOTE MIRACLE IS COMING. JOE BIDEN SAYING WE NEED A PLAN A NATIONAL STRATEGY. A PRESIDENT WHO IS WILLING TO LEAD WILLING TO BE A ROLE MODEL FOR OUR NATION. FOR OUR CHILDREN. TRUMP STILL DOESN'T HAVE A PLAN HE STILL DOESN'T HAVE A PLAN. JOE BIDEN RELEASED HIS FIRST PLAN IN MARCH. AND HERE'S WHAT YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND ABOUT THE NATURE OF A PANDEMIC. IT'S RELENTLESS YOU CAN'T STOP IT WITH THE TWEET. YOU CAN'T CREATE A DISTRACTION AND HOPE IT'LL GO AWAY. IT DOESN'T GO AWAY. BY ITS NATURE A PANDEMIC IS UNFORGIVING. IF YOU GET IT WRONG AT THE BEGINNING THE CONSEQUENCES. OUR CATASTROPHIC. AND IT'S VERY HARD TO CATCH UP YOU DON'T GET A SECOND CHANCE AT GETTING IT RIGHT. WELL PRESIDENT TRUMP HE GOT IT WRONG FROM THE BEGINNING. AND THEN HE GOT IT WRONG AGAIN AND AGAIN. AND THE CONSEQUENCES HAVE BEEN CATASTROPHIC. AND HERE'S WHY TRUMP HAS BEEN SO UNWILLING AND I'M ABLE TO DEAL WITH THIS CRISIS. FIRST HE WAS FIXATED ON THE STOCK MARKET OVER FIXING THE PROBLEM. HE TWEETED ABOUT IT CONSISTENTLY DURING THIS PERIOD. HE WAS CONVINCED THAT IS IF HIS ADMINISTRATION FOCUSED ON THIS VIRUS IT WOULD HURT THE MARKET AND HURT HIS CHANCES OF BEING REELECTED. THAT MATTERED TO HIM MORE THAN SAVING AMERICAN LIVES. SECOND RIGHT AT THE MOMENT THAT WE NEEDED DONALD TRUMP TO BE TOUGH ON THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT HE CAVED. ON TWENTY JANUARY TWENTY FOURTH HE PRAISED THE TRANSPARENCY OF THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT HE SAID QUOTE. CHINA HAS BEEN WORKING HARD TO CONTAIN THE CORONAVIRUS THE UNITED STATES GREATLY APPRECIATES THEIR EFFORTS AND TRANSPARENCY IT WILL ALL WORK OUT WELL. BUT THEY WEREN'T BEING TRANSPARENT. THEY BLOCKED PUBLIC HEALTH INSPECTORS FROM OUR CDC FROM GETTING ACCESS AND INFORMATION THAT THEY NEEDED TO PROTECT AMERICAN LIVES. DONALD TRUMP STOOD IDLY BY. AND FOLKS IT WAS A DEADLY DECISION. INSTEAD OF RISING TO MEET THE MOST DIFFICULT MOMENT OF HIS PRESIDENCY. DONALD TRUMP THROWS. HE WAS SCARED. AND HE WAS PETTY AND VINDICTIVE. ON A CALL WITH GOVERNORS ACROSS THE COUNTRY ON MARCH SIXTEENTH HE TOLD THEM IT WASN'T HIS JOB TO GET PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT TO FRONTLINE WORKERS HE SAID QUOTE. RESPIRATORS VENTILATORS ALL OF THE EQUIPMENT TRY GETTING IT YOURSELVES UNQUOTE. ON THAT DAY WE HAD ABOUT FIVE THOUSAND CASES AS A NATION. TODAY WE HAVE NEARLY SIX MILLION. EVEN NOW SOME EIGHT MONTHS INTO THIS CRISIS DONALD TRUMP STILL WON'T TAKE RESPONSIBILITY HE STILL WON'T ACT. AND THE TRAGEDY IN ALL OF THIS. IS IT DIDN'T HAVE TO BE THIS BAD. JUST LOOK AROUND IT'S NOT LIKE THIS AND THE REST OF THE WORLD. ALL WE NEEDED. GUYS ALL WE NEEDED WAS A COMPETENT PRESIDENT. ONE WAS WILLING TO LISTEN. WILLING TO LEAD TAKE RESPONSIBILITY HAVE A PLAN. DO THEIR JOB. WELL JOE BIDEN WILL BE THAT PRESIDENT. IT'S GOT A NATIONAL STRATEGY HE'S MORE THAN READY TO LEAVE. EVERY MONTH SINCE MARCH AS THIS PANDEMIC IS UNFOLDED JOE BIDEN HAS UPDATED THE STEPS HE WOULD TAKE TO SAVE AMERICAN LIVES. AND HE'S DONE IT BASED ON WHAT EVERY SO. EVERY EXPERT EVERY ECONOMIST SAID WE SHOULD BE DOING. AS PRESIDENT. JOE BIDEN WE'LL PUT A PLAN INTO EFFECT ON DAY ONE. DEVELOP AND DEPLOY RAPID TEST WITH IMMEDIATE RESULTS MAKE SURE TESTING TREATMENTS AND ULTIMATELY A VACCINE REACH ALL AMERICANS INCLUDING COMMUNITIES OF COLOR WHO HAS HISTORICALLY BEEN LEFT BEHIND. MANUFACTURE THE MEDICAL SUPPLIES AND PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT WE NEED. AND MAKE THEM RIGHT HERE IN AMERICA SO WE'RE NEVER AGAIN AT THE MERCY OF CHINA AND OTHER FOREIGN COUNTRIES TO PROTECT OUR OWN PEOPLE. JOHN I WILL MAKE SURE OUR SCHOOLS HAVE ALL THE RESOURCES THEY NEED TO BE OPEN AND SAFE AND EFFECTIVE. PUT POLITICS ASIDE AND NOT SILENCE THE EXPERTS SO THE PUBLIC GETS THE INFORMATION THEY NEED AND DESERVE. AND PUT IN PLACE A NATION WIDE MASK MANDATE. BECAUSE IN JOE'S WORDS IT'S NOT A BURDEN TO PROTECT EACH OTHER. AND HE SAYS THAT BECAUSE THE THING ABOUT JOE IS HE KNOWS WE'RE ALL IN THIS TOGETHER. DONALD TRUMP SAYS THERE'S NOTHING HE COULD HAVE DONE TO PREVENT ALL THIS DEATH. HERE'S THE TRUTH. BARACK OBAMA AND JOE BIDEN HAD A PROGRAM CALLED PROJECT. THAT TRACK EMERGING. DISEASES IN PLACES LIKE CHINA. I'M GONNA REPEAT THAT. THE PROGRAM TRACKED EMERGING DISEASES IN PLACES LIKE CHINA. TRUMP CUT IT. THEY DETECTED A TEAM AND CREATED THAT TEAM IN THE NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL TO GLOBAL HEALTH AND SECURITY DEDICATING THEM TO THE WORK OF GLOBAL HEALTH AND SECURITY AND BIODEFENSE. DONALD TRUMP ELIMINATED IT. THEY IMPLEMENTED STANDARDS FOR NURSING HOMES TO IMPROVE INFECTION CONTROL. DONALD TRUMP IS THE RACING THEM. BEFORE THE VIRUS HIT TRUMP MADE OUR COUNTRY VULNERABLE. AFTER IT WAS STRUCK HE FAILED TO DO WHAT WAS NECESSARY. AS IT CONTINUES HE'S MAKING IT WORSE EVERY DAY. JUST THIS WEEK JUST THIS WEEK THE SOCIAL SECURITY ADMINISTRATION SAID A CUT TO SOCIAL SECURITY LIKE THE ONE TRUMP IS PROPOSING WOULD AND DISABILITY BENEFITS WITHIN ONE YEAR. AND ALL BENEFITS WITHIN THREE YEARS. SO LET ME BE AS CLEAR AS POSSIBLE. IF DONALD TRUMP'S EXTREME PROPOSAL GOES INTO EFFECT THE CHECKS THAT AMERICAN SENIORS ARE RELYING ON. THAT YOU RELY ON TO PAY YOUR BILLS TO BUY YOUR MEDICINE. TO LIVE. STOP COMING. THE VERY PEOPLE WHO HAVE SUFFERED SO GREATLY IN THIS CRISIS. IT'S UNTHINKABLE. AND IN THE MIDDLE OF THE HEALTH CRISIS MADE WORSE BY HIS OWN ACTIONS. DONALD TRUMP IS IN COURT RIGHT NOW. TRYING TO THROW OUT THE ENTIRE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT INCLUDING THE PROTECTIONS IT PROVIDES FOR PEOPLE WITH PRE EXISTING CONDITIONS. SO THAT MEANS IF YOU ARE FORTUNATE. ENOUGH TO SURVIVE COVID NINETEEN INSURERS COULD DENY YOU COVERAGE FOR TREATING ANY LONG TERM EFFECTS. NOW PRESIDENT TRUMP WON'T TELL YOU ANY OF THIS AT THE REPUBLICAN CONVENTION TONIGHT. AND WE ALL KNOW. HE'S NOT CHANGING. THE PRESIDENT HE HAS BEEN IS THE PRESIDENT HE WILL BE. BUT WE HAVE A CHANCE TO RIGHT THESE WRONGS AND PUT AMERICA ON A BETTER PATH FORWARD. ONE WHERE THE LEADERS WE ELECT LISTEN TO THE EXPERTS AND FOLLOW THE BEST MEDICAL GUIDANCE TO KEEP US AND OUR FAMILIES HEALTHY AND SAFE. ONE WHERE WE TAKE MEANINGFUL ACTION AGAINST SYSTEMS AND TRADITIONS OF OPPRESSION. ONE WHERE WE STOP FANNING THE FLAMES OF HATE AND DIVISION AND TREAT ONE ANOTHER WITH THE RESPECT AND THE DIGNITY THAT EACH ONE OF US DESERVES. AS JOE BIDEN SAID IN HIS ACCEPTANCE SPEECH. WE HAVE A CHOICE. BETWEEN THE LIGHT AND THE DARK. I BELIEVE AMERICA WILL CHOOSE THE LIGHT. THANK YOU. AFTER THE SHOT GARTH.,b d afternoon on the eve of the fifty seventh march on washington i will speak about the recent event and conduct wisconsin the wildfire rage across the california coast to the

not take responsibility PRON still will not act and the tragedy in all of this be PRON do not have to be this bad just look around PRON be not like this and the rest of the world all PRON need guy all PRON need be a competent president one be willing to listen willing to lead take responsibility have a plan do PRON job well joe biden will be that president PRON be get a national strategy PRON be more than ready to leave every month since march as this pandemic be unfolded joe biden have update the step PRON would take to save american life and PRON be do PRON base on what every so every

ultimately a vaccine reach all americans include community of color who have historically be leave behind manufacture the medical supply and protective equipment PRON need and make PRON right here in america so PRON be never again at the mercy of china and other foreign country to protect PRON own people john i will make sure PRON school have all the resource PRON need to be open and safe and effective put politic aside and not silence the expert so the public get the information PRON need and deserve and put in place a nation wide mask mandate because in joe word PRON be not a burden to protect each other and PRON say that because the thing about joe be PRON know PRON be all in this together donald trump say there be nothing PRON could have do to prevent all this death here be the truth barack obama and joe biden have a program call project that track emerge disease in place like china PRON be go to repeat that the program track emerge disease in place like china trump cut PRON

PRON own action donald trump be in court right now try to throw out the entire affordable care act include the protection PRON provide for people with pre existing condition so that mean if PRON be fortunate enough to survive covid nineteen insurer could deny PRON coverage for treat any long term effect now president trump will not tell PRON any of this at the republican convention tonight and PRON all know PRON be not change the president PRON have be be the president PRON will be but PRON have a chance to right these wrong and put america on a well path forward one where the leader PRON elect listen to the expert and follow the good medical guidance to keep PRON and PRON family healthy and safe one where PRON take meaningful action against system and tradition of oppression one where PRON stop fan the flame of hate and division and treat one another with the respect and the dignity that each one of PRON deserve as joe biden say in PRON acceptance speech PRON have a choice between the light and the dark i believe america will choose the light thank PRON after the shot garth
106,YuNJUS7pbSM,harris,2020-09-28T19:09:58Z,Kamala Harris Responds LIVE to Trumpâ€™s Supreme Court Nomination,speech,">>Please welcome Senator Kamala Harris. KAMALA HARRIS: Good afternoon. On Friday morning morning,
I attended the memorial service of Justice Ruth
Bader Ginsburg in the United States capital. She was the first woman in our
history to lie in state. I sat a few feet away from her
flag-draped calvinget to
pay my respects and it was somber
and it was personal. And it was an extraordinary
moment for me as I'm sure
it was for you and millions
of Americans and people around
the world who felt a connection
with the great R RBG. It was sad because we lost
a giant, not only of the court but of American life. It was a celebration. Few people in our history
have done more to change the
lives of the American people
than Ruth Bader Ginsburg did as a lawyer, an advocate
and a Supreme Court justice. And it was an inspiration
and a call to each
of us, for each of us to be better,
to stay in the fight and stay committed to
what motivated Justice Ginsburg
the most. That phrase
etched in the Marble of the
United States Supreme Court,
equal justice under law. Justice Ginsburg came to her view
of the law not from a textbook
but from life, her own life. She often told the
story of how she had personally
felt the sting of
discrimination, as a woman, as the
mother of a young child
trying to find work. And so she committed her life, step
by step, case by case, law
by law, to tear down the obstacles
in the way of so many, and especially women. Now we are about to
undertake the task of finding her replacement
on the United States Supreme Court. Of course, it's hard to say those words words. In truth, Ruth
Bader Ginsburg cannot be replaced. She was an original, a one-of-a-kind. She combined a steel spine with an ability to extend
an open hand, never
a closed fist. She demonstrated
you could both hold firm to your principles and
still hear those with whom you disagree. That is a lesson that should
be ringing in our ears. But it looks like this president
and his party are not interested in hearing any
of the lessons from Justice Ginsburg. Already the president and his party have chosen to ignore Justice
Ginsburg's final wish to
hold off the nomination to
replace her until after the next president is chosen -- a wish, by the
way, shared by the American people. And look, it's not
complicated. The voters would
simply like to have an opportunity
to vote for their president before the Senate
votes on a nominee. And that's not too much to ask. But President Trump and his
party are not interested in
hearing the will of the people. In fact, my sense is that they're afraid of what they're going
to be told. We are not even
debating -- OK, this is really important. We're not even debating whether
the Senate should hold
hearings on a nominee in an
election year. We're not in
the middle of an election year. We're in the middle of
an election, an ongoing election. Almost a million Americans have already voted,
and more will vote this week and next week, and in just a few weeks, all Americans
have will voted. But President Trump and his
party don't care. They just want to jam this nomination
through as fast as they can. It's called raw power. But President
Trump and his party are about to learn something. They may think that it is they
who have the power in this
country, but they don't. The American people are the
ones who have the power. You have the power and you
can make it very clear,
very soon, how you feel about
being cut out of this Supreme Court nomination process. Even worse, though, than the president and his party ignoring Justice
Ginsburg's final wish is their determination
to appoint a justice who
will undo her life's work. Let's be clear. The Supreme Court will impact our lives in three critical ways. First, President
Trump and his party have made it clear they will pick
a justice who will get rid of the Affordable Care Act. In fact, just days
after the election, the court will hear a case that could strike down
the Affordable Care Act in
its entirety. It's a decision
that could take away health
care for 20 million Americans. It is a decision that could take away protections for pre-existing
conditions for more than 100
million people in our country. It's a decision
that could take away medicare
benefits for seniors. It's a decision that could toss
out the rule that says children
can be offered on their parent' health care up
to the age of 26. All of that will hurt the millions
of Americans who have come
to rely on the Affordable Care Act. And what is especially
offensive about what President
Trump and his party
are up to is this: Getting rid of the Affordable Care Act will take us backward
to a time where you could charge a woman more for
her health care than you
can charge a man, just because
she's a woman. Getting rid of the factually will take us backward to a
time when preg pregnancy could be considered a
pre-existing condition. Getting rid of the Affordable
Care Act will take away birth
control and contraceptionive
coverage for women. And get this: This relentless
obsession with over overturning
the Affordable Care Act is driven entirely
by a blind rage toward President
Obama, and it's happening at a moment when
our country is suffering through the ravages of a
pandemic that has claimed more than 200,000 lives in our country. Complications from COVID-19, like
lung scarring and heart damage,
could well become the next
pre-existing condition. In short, there are few things
they could do that would be
more offensive to the legacy
and the life of Justice Ginsburg
than to return us to
the full-scale policies of
discrimination in health care
toward the women of our country. But that's what
overturning the Affordable
Care Act will do, and overturning the Affordable Care
Act is a way a nominee gets
the support of this president
and his party. As Attorney General of California,
I defended your right to
health care. As senator, I voted to protect your
right to health care. But now President Trump has nominated
Judge Amy Coney Barrett,
and we know where Judge Barrett stands on the Affordable Care Act. Judge Barrett is on record opposing the decision that upheld the Affordable Care Act. As recently as 2017 she specifically
attacked the Chief Justice's
opinion in an article where
she said, "" ""Chief Justice Roberts pushed the Affordable
Care Act beyond its plausible meaning to save the statute."" If
nothing else, the voters should
be very clear about one thing: President Trump and his party and Judge
Barrett will overturn the
Affordable Care Act and they won't stop there. They have made clear that they want
to overturn Roe versus Wade
and restrict reap deductively
rights and freedoms. Judge Barrett has a long record
of opposing abortion and
reproductive rights. There is no other issue that so
disrespects and dishonors
the work of Justice Ginsburg's
life than undoing the seminal
decision in the court's
history that made it clear
a woman has a right to make decisions about her own body. But that's where
President Trump and his party and Judge Barrett are. So let's make it clear where we are. Let's vote for
health care, vote for the
Affordable Care Act, vote as
if your life, your choice,
depends on it, because it does. Make it clear to President
Trump and to every Republican
senator that if they're
determined to get rid of
your health care, you'll be just as determined to
vote them out of office office. And second, vote as if your right to vote
depends on it, because it does. In 2013, the Supreme Court's
decision in Shelby gutted
the hearts of the Voting
Rights Act. Soon after, numerous
states, including Texas
and North Carolina and Alabama and Mississippi, enacted discriminatory
laws designed to suppress the people's right to vote
and targeted people of color and students. Justice Ginsburg wrote that the
decision was like ""throwing away your umbrella in
a rainstorm."" Right here in North Carolina, a voter suppression law was described by
a Federal Court as having targeted African-Americans with almost surgical
precision to deny us the
right to vote. Surgical precision. After the people of
Florida voted to grant formally incarcerated
citizens the right to vote,
Republican officials recently
enacted a modern-day poll
tax to make it harder for
those citizens to exercise that
very right in this upcoming
election, and this modern-day
poll tax was upheld by the 11th circuit court
of appeals in large part because
of judges appointed by
Donald Trump. But you see here's the thing: He knows
he can't win if the people vote. Donald Trump is weak. So he is throwing up every
roadblock he can to try
and just the vote -- suppress. And we, the people, cannot
let them get away with it. Third, what's at stake? Our ability to
make a living, take care of
our families, and dismantle systemic racism. That's at stake too. For example, court decisions can
determine your ability to earn a living wage, to receive
equal pay for equal work
or collect collectivity bargain for your rights at work. With an extra vote
on the court, Donald Trump and his
party will continue their attack on laws that
keep our air clean and our
food and water safe, and attack any legislation
that addresses climate change. They will also continue
to divide us and ignore the systemic racism that
still plagues our society. Their decisions could
fail to hold the actors in
our criminal justice system
accountable, victims of abuse
of power by law enforcement could be less likely
to succeed on their civil
rights claims. The due process
rights of criminal defendants
could be less likely
to be vigorous vigorously enforced. These are the decisions
that would upheld Justice
Ginsburg's life's work to
uphold basic liberties of
all Americans, regardless of
race, gender, sexual orientation, religion, disability or economic station. Yes, she was part of our culture. Yes, we wear
those notorious T-shirts with a lot of pride. But since she passed, there
are parents remind reminding their children that she helped their lives in
concrete yet immeasurable ways. Because of her, they
could get a job of their dreams,
fight for equal pay for
their work, marry the person
they love, serve the country
they love, and enjoy the
full rights and privileges of citizenship that they deserve, free of discrimination. And that legacy, her belief
in all of us, is at stake. The outcome of
this election, more than any
other in our lifetime, affects
every part of your life and every branch of government,
all at once, with consequences
that will last generations. And all with a
nation in crisis and at a crossroads. The pandemic, the
recession, a reckoning on ration injustice, a changing climate, a crisis
with the nomi nomination to the Supreme Court. So I know that it feels
sometimes like this is just
too much, too much for us to take, too much for our country to
take, and I think that's what they want
you to believe. They want you
to feel tired. They want you to feel
like your fight doesn't matter. But we will not give up and
we will not give in. We will not let the infection
that President Trump has injected
into the presidency and
into Congress that has paralyzed our politics and pitted Americans against each other, spread
to the United States Supreme Court. This election is
about more than the presidency
or the Senate or the Supreme Court. This election
is about our democracy. And as Joe Biden has said from
the moment he entered this
race race, it's about the soul of our nation, who we
are, what we stand for. And maybe, most
importantly, who we want to be. And that's what I felt when I said goodbye to Justice Ginsburg. She understood the
soul of our nation and what
is expected of each of us, and that belief is especially resonant at a place like Shaw University, one of
our nation's first black landmarks of higher learning, established
just six months after
the Civil War. People born into bondage and brutality
stood on this very ground as graduates and
as scholars. I stand here
at Estey hall, the country's first university hall
to educate black women in America. A century later and a few months after the greensborough Sid-ins, fellow students at Shaw established the student non-violent coordinating committee that
our dear John Lewis would
one day lead. I stand here on their shoulders, and
with all of you as the nominee
for Vice President of the United States, I stand with Joe Biden, who will
be your next president. I stand with Cal cunningham, who
will be the next senator
from the great state of North Carolina. And I stand
with them and the American
people to fight for a Supreme
Court justice who, like Justice
Ginsburg, truly believes in equal justice under law. May God bless
Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. May God bless you all,
and may God bless the United
States of America.",b please welcome senator kamala harris kamala harris good afternoon on friday morning morning ni attend the memorial service of justice ruth nbader ginsburg in the united states

117,t_G0ia3JOVs,harris,2020-10-07T00:00:00Z,VP Debate (Harris),speech,"Thank you, Susan. Well, the American people have witnessed what is the greatest failure of any presidential administration in the history of our country. And here are the facts. 210,000 dead people in our country in just the last several months. Over 7 million people who have contracted this disease. One in five businesses closed. We're looking at frontline workers who have been treated like sacrificial workers. We are looking at over 30 million people, who in the last several months, had to file for unemployment. And here's the thing, on January 28th, the vice president and the president were informed about the nature of this pandemic. They were informed that it's lethal in consequence, that it is airborne, that it will affect young people, and that it would be contracted because it is airborne. And they knew what was happening, and they didn't tell you. Can you imagine if you knew on January 28th, as opposed to March 13th, what they knew, what you might've done to prepare? They knew, and they covered it up. The president said it was a hoax. They minimized the seriousness of it. The president said, ""You're on one side of his ledger if you wear a mask. You're on the other side of his ledger if you don't."" And in spite of all of that, today, they still don't have a plan. They still don't have a plan. Well, Joe Biden does. And our plan is about what we need to do around a national strategy for contact tracing, for testing, for administration of the vaccine, and making sure that it will be free for all. That is the plan that Joe Biden has and that I have, knowing that we have to get a hold of what has been going on, and we need to save our country. And Joe Biden is the best leader to do that. And frankly, this administration has forfeited their- ... right to reelection based on this. Absolutely. Whatever the vice president is claiming the administration has done, clearly, it hasn't worked. When you're looking at over 210,000 dead bodies in our country, American lives that have been lost, families that are grieving that loss, and the vice president is the head of the task force and knew on January 28th, how serious this was. And then, thanks to Bob Woodward, we learned that they knew about it. And then when that was exposed, the vice president said, when asked, ""Well, why didn't you all tell anybody?"" He said, ""Because the president wanted people to remain calm."" No. But Susan, this is important. And I want to add- Mr. Vice President, I'm speaking. I'm speaking. Thank you. So I want to ask the American people, how calm were you when you were panicked about where you were going to get your next roll of toilet paper? How calm were you when your kids were sent home from school and you didn't know when they could go back? How calm were you- ... when your children- ... couldn't see your parents because you were afraid they could kill them. I'm referring to the president- Let's talk about respecting the American people. You respect the American people when you tell them the truth. You respect the American people when you have the courage to be a leader. Speaking of those things that you may not want people to hear, but they need to hear so they can protect themselves. But this administration stood on information that, if you had as a parent, if you had as a worker, knowing you didn't have enough money saved up, and now you're standing in a food line because of the ineptitude of a administration that was unwilling to speak the truth to the American people. So let's talk about caring about the American people. The American people have had to sacrifice far too much because of the incompetence of this administration. It is asking too much of the people- It is asking too much of the people. That they would not be equipped with the information they need to help themselves to protect their parents and their children. That's fine, I'm Kamala. If the public health professionals, if Dr. Fauci, if the doctors tell us that we should take it, I'll be the first in line to take it, absolutely. But if Donald Trump tells us that we should take it, I'm not taking it. Let me tell you first of all, the day I got the call from Joe Biden, it was actually a Zoom call, asking me to serve with him on this ticket was probably one of the most memorable days of my life. I thought about my mother, who came to the United States at the age of 19, gave birth to me at the age of 25 at Kaiser Hospital in Oakland, California. And the thought that I'd be sitting here right now, I know, would make her proud. And she must be looking down on this. Joe and I were raised in a very similar way. We were raised with values that are about hard work, about the value and the dignity of public service, and about the importance of fighting for the dignity of all people. And I think Joe asked me to serve with him because I have a career that included being elected the first woman District Attorney of San Francisco, where I created models of innovation for law enforcement, in terms of reform of the criminal justice system. I was elected the first woman of color, and black woman to be elected Attorney General of the state of California, where I ran the second largest department of justice in the United States. Second only to the United States Department of Justice. And there, I took on everything from transnational criminal organizations, to the big banks that were taking advantage of homeowners, to for-profit colleges that were taking advantage of veterans. And then of course, now I serve in the United States Senate as only the second black woman ever elected to the United States Senate. I serve on the Senate Intelligence Committee where I've been in regular receipt of classified information about threats to our nation in hotspots around the world. I've traveled the world, I've met with our soldiers in war zones. And I think Joe has asked me to serve with him because he knows that we share a purpose, which is about lifting up the American people. And after the four years that we have seen of Donald Trump unifying our country around our common values and principles. Thank you. Absolutely. And that's why Joe Biden has been so incredibly transparent. And certainly by contrast that the President has not, both in terms of health records, but also let's look at taxes. We now know because of great investigative journalism that Donald Trump paid $750 in taxes. When I first heard about it, I literally said, ""You mean $750,000?"" And it was like no, $750. We now know Donald Trump owes and is in debt for $400 million. And just so everyone is clear, when we say in debt, it means you owe money to somebody. And it'd be really good to know who the President of the United States, the commander-in-chief owes money to because the American people have a right to know what is influencing the President's decisions. And is he making those decisions on the best interest of the American people, of you or self-interest? So, Susan, I'm glad you asked about transparency because it has to be across the board. Joe has been incredibly transparent over many, many years. The one thing we all know about Joe, he puts it all out there. He is honest, he is forthright, but Donald Trump on the other hand has been about covering up everything. Thank you. That's a great segue. Thank you. On the issue of the economy, I think there couldn't be a more fundamental difference between Donald Trump and Joe Biden. Joe Biden believes you measure the health and the strength of America's economy based on the health and the strength of the American worker and the American family. On the other hand, you have Donald Trump who measures the strength of the economy based on how rich people are doing, which is why he passed a tax bill benefiting the top one percent and the biggest corporations of America, leading to a two trillion dollar deficit that the American people are going to have to pay for. On day one, Joe Biden will repeal that tax bill, he'll get rid of it. And what he'll do with the money is invest it in the American people. And through a plan that is about investing in infrastructure, something that Donald Trump said he would do, I remember hearing about some infrastructure week, I don't think it ever happened, but Joe Biden will do that. He'll invest in infrastructure. It's about upgrading our roads and bridges, but also investing in clean energy and renewable energy. Joe was going to invest that money in what we need to do around innovation. There was a time when our country believed in science and invested in research and development, so that we were an innovation leader on the globe. Joe Biden will use that money to invest in education. So for example, for folks who want to go to a two-year community college, it will be free. If you come from a family that makes less than $125,000, you'll go to a public university for free. And across the board, we'll make sure that if you have student loan debt, it's cut by $10,000. That's how Joe Biden thinks about the economy which is, it's about investing in the people of our country. As opposed to passing a tax bill, which had the benefit of letting American corporations go off-shore to do their business. You're welcome. That's not what I said. Well, I mean, I thought we saw enough of it in last week's debate, but I think this is supposed to be a debate based on fact and truth and the truth and the fact is, Joe Biden has been very clear, he will not raise taxes on anybody who makes less than $400,000 a year. Mr. Vice President, I'm speaking. I'm speaking. That is- That is absolutely not true, [crosstalk 00:00:29:32]. If you don't mind letting me finish, we can then have a conversation, okay? Okay. Joe Biden will not raise taxes on anyone who makes less than $400,000 a year. He has been very clear about that. Joe Biden will not end fracking, he has been very clear about that. Joe Biden is the one who, during the great recession was responsible for the Recovery Act that brought America back. And now that Trump- ... for the Recovery Act that brought America back, and now the Trump-Pence administration wants to take credit when they rode the coattails of Joe Biden's success for the economy that they had at the beginning of their term. Of course, now the economy is a complete disaster, but Joe Biden on the one hand did that. On the other hand, you have Donald Trump who has reigned over a recession that is being compared to the Great Depression. On the one hand, you have Joe Biden who was responsible with President Barack Obama for the Affordable Care Act, which brought healthcare to over 20 million Americans and protected people with preexisting conditions. And what it also did is it saved those families who otherwise were going bankrupt because of hospital bills they could not afford. On the other hand, you have Donald Trump, who is in court right now, trying to get rid of- ... trying to get rid of the Affordable Care Act, which means that you will lose protections if you have preexisting conditions. And I just, this is very important, Susan. [crosstalk 00:31:03] He interrupted me, and I'd like to just finish, please. If you have a preexisting condition, heart disease, diabetes, breast cancer, they're coming for you. If you love someone who has a pre-existing condition [crosstalk 00:01:21], they're coming for you. If you are under the age of 26 on your parents' coverage, they're coming for you. You're welcome. So, first of all, I will repeat and the American people know that Joe Biden will not ban fracking. That is a fact. That is a fact. I will repeat that Joe Biden has been very clear that he thinks about growing jobs, which is why he will not increase taxes for anyone who makes less than $400,000 a year. Joe Biden's economic plan... Moody's, which is a reputable Wall Street firm, has said will create seven million more jobs than Donald Trump's. And part of those jobs that will be created by Joe Biden are going to be about clean energy and renewable energy. Because, you see, Joe understands that the West Coast of our country is burning, including my home state of California. Joe sees what is happening on the Gulf states, which are being battered by storms. Joe has seen and talked with the farmers in Iowa whose entire crops have been destroyed because of floods. And so Joe believes, again, in science. I'll tell you something, Susan, I served when I first got to the Senate on the committee that's responsible for the environment. Do you know, this administration took the word science off the website, and then took the phrase climate change off the website? We have seen a pattern with this administration, which is they don't believe in science. And Joe's plan is about saying we're going to deal with it, but we're also going to create jobs. Donald Trump, when asked about the wildfires in California, and the question was, the science is telling us this... You know what Donald Trump said? Science doesn't know. So let's talk about who is prepared to lead our country over the course of the next four years on what is an existential threat to us as human beings. Joe is about saying we're going to invest that in renewable energy, which is going to be about the creation of millions of jobs. We will achieve net zero emissions by 2050, carbon neutral by 2035. Joe has a plan. This has been a lot of talk from the Trump administration, and really it has been to go backward instead of forward. We will also reenter the Climate Agreement with pride. Well, on the issue of jobs. Let's talk about that. The vice-president earlier referred to it as part of what he thinks is an accomplishment. The president's trade war with China. You lost that trade war. You lost it. What ended up happening is because of a so-called trade war with China, America lost 300,000 manufacturing jobs. Farmers have experienced bankruptcy because of it. We are in a manufacturing recession because of it. And when we look at where this administration has been, there are estimates that by the end of the term of this administration, they will have lost more jobs than almost any other presidential administration and the American people know what I'm talking about. I think about 20 year olds, we have a 20 something year old who are coming out of high school and college right now. And you're wondering, is there going to be a job there for me? We're looking at people who are trying to figure out how they're going to pay rent by the end of the month, almost half of American renters are worried about whether they're going to be able to pay rent by the end of the month. This is where the economy is in America right now. And it is because of the catastrophe and the failure of leadership of this administration. Listen- I just need to respond very quickly. Thank you- Thank you. Joe Biden is responsible for saving America's auto industry and you voted against it. So let's set the record straight. Thank you. Susan, the Trump administration's perspective and approach to China has resulted in the loss of American lives, American jobs, and America's standing. There is a weird obsession that President Trump has had with getting rid of whatever accomplishment was achieved by President Obama and Vice President Biden. For example, they created within the White House and office that basically was responsible for monitoring pandemics. They got rid of it. There was a team of disease experts that President Obama and Vice President Biden dispatched to China to monitor what is now predictable and what might happen. They pulled them out. We now are looking at 210,000 Americans who have lost their lives. Let's look at the job situation. We mentioned before, the trade deal, the trade war, they wanted to call it with China. It resulted in the loss of over 300 manufacturing jobs and a manufacturing recession and the American consumer paid thousands of dollars, more for goods because of that failed war that they called it. Then let's talk about standing. Pew, a reputable research firm has done an analysis that shows that leaders of all of our formerly allied countries have now decided that they hold in greater esteem and respect Xi Jinping the head of the Chinese communist party than they do Donald Trump. The President of the United States, the commander in chief of the United States. This is where we are today because of a failure of leadership by this administration. So I love talking with Joe about a lot of these issues and Joe, I think he said it quite well. He says, ""Foreign policy, it might sound complicated, but really it's relationships."" Just think about it as relationships. So we know this in our personal and professional relationships, you got to keep your word to your friends. Got to be loyal to your friends. People who've stood with, you got to stand with them. You got to know who your adversaries are and keep them in check. But what we have seen with Donald Trump is that he has betrayed our friends and embraced dictators around the world. Let's take for example, Russia. So I serve on the intelligence committee of the United States Senate. America's Intelligence Community told us Russia interfered in the election of the president of the United States in 2016 and his plan in 2020. Christopher Wray, the director of the FBI said the same, but Donald Trump, the commander in chief of the United States of America prefers to take the word of Vladimir Putin over the word of the American Intelligence Community. You look at our friends at NATO, he has walked away from agreements. You can look at the Iran nuclear deal, which now has put us in a position where we are less safe because they are building up what might end up being a significant nuclear arsenal. We were in that deal guys. We were in the Iran nuclear deal with friends, with allies around the country. And because of Donald Trump's unilateral approach to foreign policy, coupled with his isolationism, he pulled us out and has made America less safe. So Susan it's about relationships. And the thing that has always been part of the strength of our nation in addition to our great military has been that we keep our word, but Donald Trump doesn't understand that because he doesn't understand what it means to be honest. He doesn't understand what it means to be honest. But I would like equal time. Thank you. First of all, to the Mueller family, I know about your daughter's case, and I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. What happened to her is awful and it should have never happened, and I know Joe feels the same way, and I know that president Obama feels the same way, but you mentioned Soleimani. Let's start there. So, after the strike on Soleimani, there was a counter strike on our troops in Iraq, and they suffered serious brain injuries, and do you know what Donald Trump dismissed them as? Headaches. And this is about a pattern of Donald Trump's where he has referred to our men who are serving in our military as suckers and losers. Donald Trump, who went to Arlington cemetery and stood above the graves of our fallen heroes and said, ""What's in it for them?"" Because of course, he only thinks about what's in it for him. Let's take what he said about John McCain, a great American hero, and Donald Trump says, ""He doesn't deserve to be called a hero because it was a prisoner of war."" Take, and this is very important when you want to talk about who is the current commander in chief and what they care about and what they don't care about. Public reporting that Russia had bounties on the heads of American soldiers. And you know what a bounty is? It's somebody puts a price on your head and they will pay it if you are killed, and Donald Trump had talked at least six times to Vladimir Putin and never brought up the subject. Joe Biden would never do that. But Joe Biden would hold Russia to account for any threat to our nation security or to our troops who are sacrificing their lives for the sake of our democracy and our safety. Yes. Thank you, Susan. First of all, Joe Biden and I are both people of faith, and it's insulting to suggest that we would knock anyone for their faith, and in fact, Joe, if elected, will be only the second practicing Catholic as President of the United States. On the issue of this nomination, Joe and I are very clear, as are the majority of the American people, we are 27 days before the decision about who will be the next President of the United States, and before, when this conversation has come up, it's been about election year or election time. We're literally in an election. Over 4 million people have voted. People are in the process of voting right now. And so, Joe has been very clear, as the American people are, let the American people fill that seat in the White House. And then we'll fill that seat on the United States Supreme court, and to your point, Susan, the issues before us, couldn't be more serious. There's the issue of choice and I will always fight for a woman's right to make a decision about her own body. It should be her decision and not that Donald Trump, and the Vice President, Michael Pence, but let's also look at what else is before the court. It's the Affordable Care Act like literally in the midst of a public health pandemic when over 210,000 people have died and 7 million people probably have what will be in the future considered a preexisting condition because you contracted the virus. Donald Trump is in court right now trying to get rid of the Affordable Care Act, and I said it before, and it bears repeating. This means that there will be no more protections if they win for people with pre-existing conditions. This means that over 20 million people will lose your coverage. It means that if you're under the age of 26, you can't stay on your parents' coverage anymore, and here's the thing. The contrast couldn't be more clear. They're trying to get rid of the Affordable Care Act. Joe Biden is saying let's expand coverage. Let's give you a choice of a public option or private coverage. Let's bring down premiums- ... Let's lower Medicare eligibility to 60. That's true leadership. I'm so glad we went through a little history lesson. Let's do that a little more. In 1864- Mr. Vice President, I'm speaking, I'm speaking. Okay. In 1864, one of the, I think political heroes, certainly the President, I assume you also, Mr. Vice President, is Abraham Lincoln. Abraham Lincoln was up for reelection and it was 27 days before the election. And a seat became open on the United States Supreme Court. Abraham Lincoln's party was in charge, not only of the White House, but the Senate. But Honest Aid said, ""It's not the right thing to do. The American people deserve to make the decision about who will be the next president of the United States. And then that person can select who will serve for a lifetime on the highest court of our land."" And so Joe and I are very clear: the American people are voting right now and it should be their decision about who will serve on this most important body for a lifetime. Let's talk about packing- I'm trying to answer you now. Yeah. Let's talk about packing the court then. Let's talk about the fact. Yeah, I'm about to. So the Trump Pence administration has been, because I sit on the Senate judiciary committee, Susan as you mentioned, and I've witnessed the appointments for lifetime appointments to the federal courts, district courts, courts of appeal, people who are purely ideological, people who have been reviewed by legal professional organizations and found who have been not competent are substandard. And do you know that of the 50 people who President Trump appointed to the court of appeals for lifetime appointments, not one is black? This is what they've been doing. You want to talk about packing a court? Let's have that discussion. I don't believe so. And I've talked with Breonna's mother, Tamika Palmer and her family and her family deserves justice. She was a beautiful young woman. She had as her life goal to become a nurse and she wanted to become an EMT to first learn what's going on out on the street so she could then become a nurse and save lives. And her life was taken justifiably and tragically and violently. And it brings me to the eight minutes and 46 seconds that America witnessed during which an American man was tortured and killed under the knee of an armed uniformed police officer. And people around our country of every race, of every age, of every gender, perfect strangers to each other, marched shoulder to shoulder, arm in arm, fighting for us to finally achieve that ideal of equal justice under law. And I was a part of those peaceful protests. And I believe strongly that first of all, we are never going to condone violence, but we always must fight for the values that we hold dear, including the fight to achieve our ideals. And that's why Joe Biden and I have said on this subject, look, and I'm a former career prosecutor. I know what I'm talking about. Bad cops are bad for good cops. We need reform of our policing in America and our criminal justice system, which is why Joe and I will immediately ban choke holes and carotid holes. George Floyd would be alive today if we did that. We will require a national registry for police officers who break the law. We will, on the issue of criminal justice reform, get rid of private prisons and cash bail and we will decriminalize marijuana. And we will expunge the records of those who have been convicted of marijuana. This is a time for leadership- on a tragic, tragic issue- Of honor on Black people in America who [crosstalk 00:34:11]. I'd like to respond. I will not sit here and be lectured by the Vice President on what it means to enforce the laws of our country. The only one on this stage, who has personally prosecuted everything from child sexual assault to homicide. I'm the only one on this stage who has prosecuted the big banks for taking advantage of America's homeowners. I am the only one on this stage who prosecuted for-profit colleges for taking advantage of our veterans. And the reality of this is that we are talking about an election in 27 days where last week the President of the United States took a debate stage in front of 70 million Americans and refused to condemn white supremacists. And it wasn't like he didn't have a chance. He didn't do it. And then he doubled down. And then he said, ""when pressed, stand back, stand by."" And this is a part of a pattern of Donald Trump's. He called Mexicans rapists and criminals. He instituted as his first act, a Muslim ban. He on the issue of Charlottesville, where people were peacefully protesting the need for racial justice, where a young woman was killed. And on the other side, there were neo-Nazis carrying Tiki torches, shouting racial epithets, anti-Semitic slurs. And Donald Trump when asked about it said, ""There were fine people on both sides."" This is who we have as the President of the United States and America, you deserve better. Joe Biden will be a president who brings our country together- And recognizes the beauty in our diversity and the fact that we all have so much more in common than what separates us. But he attacked my record. I would like an opportunity to respond to. I appreciate that. First of all, having served as the Attorney General of the state of California, the work that I did is a model of what our nation needs to do, and we will be able to do under a Joe Biden presidency. Our agenda includes what this administration has failed to do. It will be about not only instituting a ban on choke holes and carotid holes- I would like to go through- But I want to talk about the connection between what Joe and I will do in my record, which includes I was the first statewide officer to institute a requirement that my agents would wear body cameras and keep them on full-time. We were the first to initiate a requirement that there would be a training for law enforcement on implicit bias because yes, Joe Biden and I recognize that implicit bias does exist, Mr. Vice President, contrary to what you may believe. We did the work of instituting reforms that were about investing in re-entry. This is the work that we have done and the work we will do going forward. And again, I will not be lectured by the Vice President on our record of what we have done in terms of law enforcement and keeping our community safe and a commitment to reforming the criminal justice system of America. And a commitment to reforming the criminal justice system of America. So I'll tell you. Joe and I are particularly proud of the coalition that we've built around our campaign. We probably have one of the broadest coalitions of folks that you've ever seen in a presidential race. Of course, we have the support of Democrats, but also independents and Republicans. In fact, seven members of president George W. Bush's cabinet are supporting our ticket. We have the support of Colin Powell, Cindy McCain, John Kasich. Over 500 generals, retired generals and former national security experts and advisors are supporting our campaign. And I believe they are doing that because they know that Joe Biden has a deep, deep seated commitment to fight for our democracy, and to fight for the integrity of our democracy, and to bring integrity back to the White House. We believe in the American people, we believe in our democracy, and here's what I'd like to say to everybody. Vote, please vote, vote early, come up with a plan to vote, go to Iwillvote.com. You can also go to Joebiden.com. We have it within our power in these next 27 days to make the decision about what will be the course of our country for the next four years. And it is within our power, and if we use our vote and we use our voice, we will win. And we will not let anyone subvert our democracy with what Donald Trump has been doing as he did on the debate stage last week, when, again, in front of 70 million people, he openly attempted to suppress the vote. Joe Biden, on the other hand, on that same debate stage, because clearly Donald Trump doesn't think he can run on a record because it's a failed record, Joe Biden on that stage said, Hey, just please vote. So I'll repeat what Joe said. Please vote. First of all, I love hearing from our young leaders. And when I hear her words, when I hear your words, Brecklin, I know our future is bright because it is that perspective on who we are and who we should be that is a sign of leadership, and is something we should all aspire to be. And brings me to Joe, Joe Biden. One of the reasons that Joe decided to run for president is after Charlottesville, which we talked about earlier. It so troubled him and upset him like it did all of us, that there was that kind of hate and division. What propelled Joe to run for president was to see that over the course of the last four years, what Brecklin described has been happening. Joe has a longstanding reputation of working across the aisle, and working in a bipartisan way. And that's what he's going to do as president. Joe Biden has a history of lifting people up and fighting for their dignity. You have to know Joe's story to know that Joe has known pain. He has known suffering. And he has known love. Brecklin, when you think about the future, I do believe the future is bright. And it will be because of your leadership, and it will be because we fight for each person's voice through their vote. And we get engaged in this election, because you have the ability through your work and through, eventually, your vote, to determine the future of our country and what its leadership looks like.",b thank PRON susan well the american people have witness what be the great failure of any presidential administration in the history of PRON country and here be the fact dead people in PRON country in

PRON hasn t work when you re look at over dead body in PRON country american life that have be lose family that be grieve that loss and the vice president be the head of the task force and know on january th how serious this be and then thank to bob woodward PRON learn that PRON know about PRON and then when that be expose the vice president say when ask well why didn t PRON all tell anybody PRON say because the president want people to remain calm no but susan this be important and i want to add mr vice president i m speak i m speak thank PRON so i want to ask the american people how calm be PRON when PRON be panic about where PRON be go to get PRON next roll of toilet paper how calm be PRON when PRON kid be send home from school and PRON didn t know when PRON could go back how calm be you when PRON children couldn t see PRON parent because PRON be afraid PRON could kill PRON i m refer to the president let talk about respect the american people PRON respect the american people when PRON tell PRON the truth PRON respect the american people when PRON have the courage to be a leader speak of those thing that PRON may not want people to hear but PRON need to hear so PRON can protect PRON but this administration stand on information that if PRON have as a parent if PRON have as a worker know PRON didn t have enough money save up and now you re stand in a food line because of the ineptitude of a administration that be unwilling to speak the truth to the american people so let talk about care about the american people the american people have have to sacrifice far too much because of the incompetence of this administration PRON be ask too much of the people PRON be ask too much of the people that PRON would not be equip with the information PRON need to help PRON to protect PRON parent and PRON child that fine i m kamala if the public health professional if dr fauci if the doctor tell PRON that PRON should take PRON i ll be the first in line to take PRON absolutely but if donald trump tell PRON that PRON should take PRON i m not take PRON let PRON tell PRON first of all the day i get the call from joe biden PRON be actually a zoom call ask PRON to serve with PRON on this ticket be probably one of the most memorable day of PRON life i think about PRON mother who come to the united states at the age of give birth to PRON at the age of at kaiser hospital in oakland california and the thought that i d be sit here right now i know would make PRON proud and PRON must be look down on this joe and i be raise in a very similar way PRON be raise with value that be about hard work about the value and the dignity of public service and about the importance of fighting for the dignity of all people and i think joe ask PRON to serve with PRON because i have a career that include be elect the first woman district attorney of san francisco where i create model of innovation for law enforcement in term of reform of the criminal justice system i be elect the first woman of color and black woman to be elect attorney general of the state of california where i run the second large department of justice in the united states second only to the united states department of justice and there i take on everything from transnational criminal organization to the big bank that be take advantage of homeowner to for profit college that be take advantage of veteran and then of course now i serve in the united states senate as only the second black woman ever elect to the united states senate i serve on the senate intelligence committee where i ve be in regular receipt of classified information about threat to PRON nation in hotspot around the world i ve travel the world i ve meet with PRON soldier in war zone and i think joe have ask PRON to serve with PRON because PRON know that PRON share a purpose which be about lift up the american people and after the four year that PRON have see of donald trump unify PRON country around PRON common value and principle thank PRON absolutely and that why joe biden have be so incredibly transparent and certainly by contrast that the president have not both in term of health record but also let look at taxis PRON now know because of great investigative journalism that donald trump pay $ in taxis when i first hear about PRON i literally say PRON mean $ and PRON be like no $ PRON now know donald trump owe and be in debt for $ million and just so everyone be clear when PRON say in debt PRON mean PRON owe money to somebody and it d be really good to know who the president of the united states the commander in chief owe money to because the american people have a right to know what be influence the president decision and be PRON make those decision on the good interest of the american people of PRON or self interest so susan i m glad PRON ask about transparency because PRON have to be across the board joe have be incredibly transparent over many many year the one thing PRON all know about joe PRON put PRON all out there PRON be honest PRON be forthright but donald trump on the other hand have be about cover up everything thank PRON that be a great segue thank PRON on the issue of the economy i think there couldn t be a more fundamental difference between donald trump and joe biden joe biden believe PRON measure the health and the strength of america economy base on the health and the strength of the american worker and the american family on the other hand PRON have donald trump who measure the strength of the economy base on how rich people be do which be why PRON pass a tax bill benefit the top one percent and the big corporation of america lead to a two trillion dollar deficit that the american people be go to have to pay for on day one joe biden will repeal that tax bill he ll get rid of PRON and what he ll do with the money be invest PRON in the american people and through a plan that be about invest in infrastructure something that donald trump say PRON would do i remember hear about some infrastructure week i don t think PRON ever happen but joe biden will do that he ll invest in infrastructure it be about upgrade PRON road and bridge but also invest in clean energy and renewable energy joe be go to invest that money in what PRON need to do around innovation there be a time when PRON country believe in science and invest in research and development so that PRON be an innovation leader on the globe joe biden will use that money to invest in education so for example for folk who want to go to a two year community college PRON will be free if PRON come from a family that make less than $ you ll go to a public university for free and across the board we ll make sure that if PRON have student loan debt it cut by $ that be how joe biden think about the economy which be it be about invest in the people of PRON country as oppose to pass a tax bill which have the benefit of let american corporation go off shore to do PRON business you re welcome that be not what i say well i mean i think PRON see enough of PRON in last week debate but i think this be suppose to be a debate base on fact and truth and the truth and the fact be joe biden have be very clear PRON will not raise taxis on anybody who make less than $ a year mr vice president i m speak i m speak that is that be absolutely not true crosstalk if PRON don t mind let PRON finish PRON can then have a conversation okay okay joe biden will not raise taxis on anyone who make less than $ a year PRON have be very clear about that joe biden will not end fracke PRON have be very clear about that joe biden be the one who during the great recession be responsible for the recovery act that bring america back and now that trump for the recovery act that bring america back and now the trump pence administration want to take credit when PRON ride the coattail of joe biden success for the economy that PRON have at the beginning of PRON term of course now the economy be a complete disaster but joe biden on the one hand do that on the other hand PRON have donald trump who have reign over a recession that be be compare to the great depression on the one hand PRON have joe biden who be responsible with president barack obama for the affordable care act which bring healthcare to over million americans and protect people with preexisting condition and what PRON also do be PRON save those family who otherwise be go bankrupt because of hospital bill PRON could not afford on the other hand PRON have donald trump who be in court right now try to get rid of try to get rid of the affordable care act which mean that PRON will lose protection if PRON have preexisting condition and i just this be very important susan crosstalk PRON interrupt PRON and i d like to just finish please if PRON have a preexisting condition heart disease diabetes breast cancer they re come for PRON if PRON love someone who have a pre existing condition crosstalk they re come for PRON if PRON be under the age of on PRON parents coverage they re come for PRON you re welcome so first of all i will repeat and the american people know that joe biden will not ban fracke that be a fact that be a fact i will repeat that joe biden have be very clear that PRON think about grow job which be why PRON will not increase taxis for anyone who make less than $ a year joe biden economic plan moody which be a reputable wall street firm have say will create seven million more job than donald trump and part of those job that will be create by joe biden be go to be about clean energy and renewable energy because PRON see joe understand that the west coast of PRON country be burn include PRON home state of california joe see what be happen on the gulf states which be be batter by storm joe have see and talk with the farmer in iowa whose entire crop have be destroy because of flood and so joe believe again in science i ll tell PRON something susan i serve when i first get to the senate on the committee that be responsible for the environment do PRON know this administration take the word science off the website and then take the phrase climate change off the website PRON have see a pattern with this administration which be PRON don t believe in science and joe plan be about say we re go to deal with PRON but we re also go to create job donald trump when ask about the wildfire in california and the question be the science be tell PRON this PRON know what donald trump say science doesn t know so let talk about who be prepared to lead PRON country over the course of the next four year on what be an existential threat to PRON as human being joe be about say we re go to invest that in renewable energy which be go to be about the creation of million of job PRON will achieve net zero emission by carbon neutral by joe have a plan this have be a lot of talk from the trump administration and really PRON have be to go backward instead of forward PRON will also reenter the climate agreement with pride well on the issue of job let talk about that the vice president earlier refer to PRON as part of what PRON think be an accomplishment the president trade war with china PRON lose that trade war PRON lose PRON what end up happen be because of a so call trade war with china america lose manufacturing job farmer have experience bankruptcy because of PRON PRON be in a manufacturing recession because of PRON and when PRON look at where this administration have be there be estimate that by the end of the term of this administration PRON will have lose more job than almost any other presidential administration and the american people know what i m talk about i think about year old PRON have a something year old who be come out of high school and college right now and you re wonder be there go to be a job there for PRON we re look at people who be try to figure out how they re go to pay rent by the end of the month almost half of american renter be worried about whether they re go to be able to pay rent by the end of the month this be where the economy be in america right now and PRON be because of the catastrophe and the failure of leadership of this administration listen i just need to respond very quickly thank you thank PRON joe biden be responsible for save america auto industry and PRON vote against PRON so let set the record straight thank PRON susan the trump administration perspective and approach to china have result in the loss of american life american job and america standing there be a weird obsession that president trump have have with get rid of whatever accomplishment be achieve by president obama and vice president biden for example PRON create within the white house and office that basically be responsible for monitor pandemic PRON get rid of PRON there be a team of disease expert that president obama and vice president biden dispatch to china to monitor what be now predictable and what may happen PRON pull PRON out PRON now be look at americans who have lose PRON life let look at the job situation PRON mention before the trade deal the trade war PRON want to call PRON with china PRON result in the loss of over manufacture job and a manufacture recession and the american consumer pay thousand of dollar more for good because of that fail war that PRON call PRON then let talk about standing pew a reputable research firm have do an analysis that show that leader of all of PRON formerly ally country have now decide that PRON hold in great esteem and respect xi jinpe the head of the chinese communist party than PRON do donald trump the president of the united states the commander in chief of the united states this be where PRON be today because of a failure of leadership by this administration so i love talk with joe about a lot of these issue and joe i think PRON say PRON quite well PRON say foreign policy PRON may sound complicated but really it relationship just think about PRON as relationship so PRON know this in PRON personal and professional relationship PRON get to keep PRON word to PRON friend get to be loyal to PRON friend people who ve stand with PRON get to stand with PRON PRON get to know who PRON adversary be and keep PRON in check but what PRON have see with donald trump be that PRON have betray PRON friend and embrace dictator around the world let take for example russia so i serve on the intelligence committee of the united states senate america intelligence community tell PRON russia interfere in the election of the president of the united states in and PRON plan in christopher wray the director of the fbi say the same but donald trump the commander in chief of the united states of america prefer to take the word of vladimir putin over the word of the american intelligence community PRON look at PRON friend at nato PRON have walk away from agreement PRON can look at the iran nuclear deal which now have put PRON in a position where PRON be less safe because PRON be build up what may end up be a significant nuclear arsenal PRON be in that deal guy PRON be in the iran nuclear deal with friend with ally around the country and because of donald trump unilateral approach to foreign policy couple with PRON isolationism PRON pull PRON out and have make america less safe so susan it be about relationship and the thing that have always be part of the strength of PRON nation in addition to PRON great military have be that PRON keep PRON word but donald trump doesn t understand that because PRON doesn t understand what PRON mean to be honest PRON doesn t understand what PRON mean to be honest but i would like equal time thank PRON first of all to the mueller family i know about PRON daughter case and i m so sorry i m so sorry what happen to PRON be awful and PRON should have never happen and i know joe feel the same way and i know that president obama feel the same way but PRON mention soleimani let start there so after the strike on soleimani there be a counter strike on PRON troop in iraq and PRON suffer serious brain injury and do PRON know what donald trump dismiss PRON as headache and this be about a pattern of donald trump be where PRON have refer to PRON man who be serve in PRON military as sucker and loser donald trump who go to arlington cemetery and stand above the grave of PRON fallen hero and say what be in PRON for PRON because of course PRON only think about what be in PRON for PRON let take what PRON say about john mccain a great american hero and donald trump say PRON doesn t deserve to be call a hero because PRON be a prisoner of war take and this be very important when PRON want to talk about who be the current commander in chief and what PRON care about and what PRON don t care about public reporting that russia have bounty on the head of american soldier and PRON know what a bounty be it somebody put a price on PRON head and PRON will pay PRON if PRON be kill and donald trump have talk at least six time to vladimir putin and never bring up the subject joe biden would never do that but joe biden would hold russia to account for any threat to PRON nation security or to PRON troop who be sacrifice PRON life for the sake of PRON democracy and PRON safety yes thank PRON susan first of all joe biden and i be both people of faith and it be insulting to suggest that PRON would knock anyone for PRON faith and in fact joe if elect will be only the second practice catholic as president of the united states on the issue of this nomination joe and i be very clear as be the majority of the american people PRON be day before the decision about who will be the next president of the united states and before when this conversation have come up it be be about election year or election time we re literally in an election over million people have vote people be in the process of vote right now and so joe have be very clear as the american people be let the american people fill that seat in the white house and then we ll fill that seat on the united states supreme court and to PRON point susan the issue before PRON couldn t be more serious there be the issue of choice and i will always fight for a woman right to make a decision about PRON own body PRON should be PRON decision and not that donald trump and the vice president michael pence but let be also look at what else be before the court it be the affordable care act like literally in the midst of a public health pandemic when over people have die and million people probably have what will be in the future consider a preexisting condition because PRON contract the virus donald trump be in court right now try to get rid of the affordable care act and i say PRON before and PRON bear repeat this mean that there will be no more protection if PRON win for people with pre existing condition this mean that over million people will lose PRON coverage PRON mean that if you re under the age of PRON can t stay on PRON parents coverage anymore and here be the thing the contrast couldn t be more clear they re try to get rid of the affordable care act joe biden be say let expand coverage let give PRON a choice of a public option or private coverage let bring down premiums let low medicare eligibility to that true leadership i m so glad PRON go through a little history lesson let do that a little more in mr vice president i m speak i m speak okay in one of the i think political hero certainly the president i assume PRON also mr vice president be abraham lincoln abraham lincoln be up for reelection and PRON be day before the election and a seat become open on the united states supreme court abraham lincoln party be in charge not only of the white house but the senate but honest aid say it be not the right thing to do the american people deserve to make the decision about who will be the next president of the united states and then that person can select who will serve for a lifetime on the high court of PRON land and so joe and i be very clear the american people be vote right now and PRON should be PRON decision about who will serve on this most important body for a lifetime let talk about packing i m try to answer PRON now yeah let talk about pack the court then let talk about the fact yeah i m about to so the trump pence administration have be because i sit on the senate judiciary committee susan as PRON mention and i ve witness the appointment for lifetime appointment to the federal court district court court of appeal people who be purely ideological people who have be review by legal professional organization and find who have be not competent be substandard and do PRON know that of the people who president trump appoint to the court of appeal for lifetime appointment not one be black this be what they ve be do PRON want to talk about pack a court let have that discussion i don t believe so and i ve talk with breonna mother tamika palmer and PRON family and PRON family deserve justice PRON be a beautiful young woman PRON have as PRON life goal to become a nurse and PRON want to become an emt to first learn what be go on out on the street so PRON could then become a nurse and save life and PRON life be take justifiably and tragically and violently and PRON bring PRON to the eight minute and second that america witness during which an american man be torture and kill under the knee of an armed uniformed police officer and people around PRON country of every race of every age of every gender perfect stranger to each other marched shoulder to shoulder arm in arm fight for PRON to finally achieve that ideal of equal justice under law and i be a part of those peaceful protest and i believe strongly that first of all PRON be never go to condone violence but PRON always must fight for the value that PRON hold dear include the fight to achieve PRON ideal and that why joe biden and i have say on this subject look and i m a former career prosecutor i know what i m talk about bad cop be bad for good cop PRON need reform of PRON policing in america and PRON criminal justice system which be why joe and i will immediately ban choke hole and carotid hole george floyd would be alive today if PRON do that PRON will require a national registry for police officer who break the law PRON will on the issue of criminal justice reform get rid of private prison and cash bail and PRON will decriminalize marijuana and PRON will expunge the record of those who have be convict of marijuana this be a time for leadership on a tragic tragic issue of honor on black people in america who crosstalk i d like to respond i will not sit here and be lecture by the vice president on what PRON mean to enforce the law of PRON country the only one on this stage who have personally prosecute everything from child sexual assault to homicide i m the only one on this stage who have prosecute the big bank for take advantage of america homeowner i be the only one on this stage who prosecute for profit college for take advantage of PRON veteran and the reality of this be that PRON be talk about an election in day where last week the president of the united states take a debate stage in front of million americans and refuse to condemn white supremacist and PRON wasn t like PRON didn t have a chance PRON didn t do PRON and then PRON double down and then PRON say when press stand back stand by and this be a part of a pattern of donald trump PRON call mexicans rapist and criminal PRON institute as PRON first act a muslim ban PRON on the issue of charlottesville where people be peacefully protest the need for racial justice where a young woman be kill and on the other side there be neo nazis carry tiki torch shout racial epithet anti semitic slur and donald trump when ask about PRON say there be fine people on both side this be who PRON have as the president of the united states and america PRON deserve better joe biden will be a president who bring PRON country together and recognize the beauty in PRON diversity and the fact that PRON all have so much more in common than what separate PRON but PRON attack PRON record i would like an opportunity to respond to i appreciate that first of all have serve as the attorney general of the state of california the work that i do be a model of what PRON nation need to do and PRON will be able to do under a joe biden presidency PRON agenda include what this administration have fail to do PRON will be about not only institute a ban on choke hole and carotid holes i would like to go through but i want to talk about the connection between what joe and i will do in PRON record which include i be the first statewide officer to institute a requirement that PRON agent would wear body camera and keep PRON on full time PRON be the first to initiate a requirement that there would be a training for law enforcement on implicit bias because yes joe biden and i recognize that implicit bias do exist mr vice president contrary to what PRON may believe PRON do the work of institute reform that be about invest in re entry this be the work that PRON have do and the work PRON will do go forward and again i will not be lecture by the vice president on PRON record of what PRON have do in term of law enforcement and keep PRON community safe and a commitment to reform the criminal justice system of america and a commitment to reform the criminal justice system of america so i ll tell PRON joe and i be particularly proud of the coalition that we ve build around PRON campaign PRON probably have one of the broad coalition of folk that you ve ever see in a presidential race of course PRON have the support of democrats but also independent and republicans in fact seven member of president george w bush cabinet be support PRON ticket PRON have the support of colin powell cindy mccain john kasich over general retire general and former national security expert and advisor be support PRON campaign and i believe PRON be do that because PRON know that joe biden have a deep deep seated commitment to fight for PRON democracy and to fight for the integrity of PRON democracy and to bring integrity back to the white house PRON believe in the american people PRON believe in PRON democracy and here be what i d like to say to everybody vote please vote vote early come up with a plan to vote go to iwillvote com PRON can also go to joebiden com PRON have PRON within PRON power in these next day to make the decision about what will be the course of PRON country for the next four year and PRON be within PRON power and if PRON use PRON vote and PRON use PRON voice PRON will win and PRON will not let anyone subvert PRON democracy with what donald trump have be do as PRON do on the debate stage last week when again in front of million people PRON openly attempt to suppress the vote joe biden on the other hand on that same debate stage because clearly donald trump doesn t think PRON can run on a record because it be a fail record joe biden on that stage say hey just please vote so i ll repeat what joe say please vote first of all i love hear from PRON young leader and when i hear PRON word when i hear PRON word brecklin i know PRON future be bright because PRON be that perspective on who PRON be and who PRON should be that be a sign of leadership and be something PRON should all aspire to be and bring PRON to joe joe biden one of the reason that joe decide to run for president be after charlottesville which PRON talk about earlier PRON so trouble PRON and upset PRON like PRON do all of PRON that there be that kind of hate and division what propel joe to run for president be to see that over the course of the last four year what brecklin describe have be happen joe have a longstanding reputation of work across the aisle and work in a bipartisan way and that be what he be go to do as president joe biden have a history of lift people up and fight for PRON dignity PRON have to know joe story to know that joe have know pain PRON have know suffering and PRON have know love brecklin when PRON think about the future i do believe the future be bright and PRON will be because of PRON leadership and PRON will be because PRON fight for each person voice through PRON vote and PRON get engage in this election because PRON have the ability through PRON work and through eventually PRON vote to determine the future of PRON country and what PRON leadership look like

THAT THIS VIRUS WAS FIVE TIMES  MORE DEADLY THAN THE FLU. HE KNEW IT WOULD IMPACT  CHILDREN OF AMERICA HE KNEW IT  WAS AIRBORNE. BUT WHAT DID HE DO? HE KEPT THAT INFORMATION TO  HIMSELF I CALL IT A COVER-UP HE  DIDN'T LET YOU KNOW I JANUARY  2013 WHAT HE KNEW ON JANUARY 20  CAN YOU IMAGINE IF YOU ALL KNEW  IF WE KNEW ON JANUARY 28 WHAT  HE KNEW. CAN YOU IMAGINE WHAT PARENTS  AND FAMILIES AND EACH OF US  MIGHT'VE BEEN ABLE TO DO TO  PREPARE FOR THIS. IF WE HAD KNOWN IT WAS  AIRBORNE. WHAT WE MIGHT'VE DONE IN THE  SPIRIT REVEREND OF LOVE THY  NEIGHBOR TO MAKE SURE THAT WE  ALL WORE MASKS EVERY DAY WHAT  FOLKS MIGHT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO  DO, KNOWING THAT ALREADY IN OUR  COUNTRY THAT IN 99 PERCENT OF  THE COUNTIES IN AMERICA BEFORE  THE PANDEMIC IF YOUR MINIMUM  WAGE WORKER WORKING FULL TIME  YOU COULDN'T AFFORD FOR  ONE-BEDROOM APARTMENT WHAT  AMERICA WOULD'VE DONE TO  PREPARE FOR THE INEVITABILITY  THAT BUSINESSES MUCH OR DOWN.

(APPLAUSE). >> KAMALA HARRIS: SO WE ARE  LOOKING, AT A PUBLIC HEALTH  CRISIS. WHICH I DESCRIBE AS BEING A  CRISIS OF PROPORTION IN TERMS  OF THE LOYALISTS OF LIVES LIKE  WE HAVE NOT SEEN SINCE WORLD  WAR II. OVER 250 APPROACHING 220,000  HUMAN BEINGS THEIR LIVES LOST. SO MANY WHO COULDN'T IT COULD  EVEN BE BECAUSE THE NATURE OF  THE VIRUS WITH THEIR FAMILIES  IN THE LAST DAYS. WE ARE LOOKING AT OVER 8  MILLION PEOPLE CONTRACTED THE  VIRUS WERE LOOKING OVER 30  MILLION PEOPLE WHO HAD TO FLY  FOR A NEW FILE FOR UNEMPLOYMENT  INSURANCE. WE ARE LOOKING AT OUR CHILDREN  SO MANY OF WHOM DON'T HAVE  ACCESS TO BROADBAND MUCH LESS  HAVE A LAPTOP AND ARE TRYING TO  NOW FIGURE OUT HOW TO GET THE  EDUCATION THAT THEY DESERVE  BECAUSE OF THE GOD-GIVEN TALENT  THEY HAVE. AND HOW THAT SHOULD BE NURTURED  BUT YET THERE IS NO ACCESS AND  NO MEANINGFUL ACCESS TO THE  EDUCATION THEY NEED. THESE DAYS LOST. BECAUSE OF THIS VIRUS THAT THIS  MAN HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO DEAL  WITH BUT DENIED FACTS. DENIED  SCIENCE AND LIED TO THE  AMERICAN PEOPLE. SO WE KNOW WE NEED A CHANGE. ANNA CHANGE IS COMING. (APPLAUSE). >> KAMALA HARRIS: IN THE MIDDLE  OF IT ALL DONALD TRUMP HAS THIS  WEIRD OBSESSION WITH TRYING TO  GET RID OF BARACK OBAMA AND JOE  BIDEN CREATED. HAVE YOU NOTICED  THAT? IT'S THIS WEIRD OBSESSION.  RIGHT? AND SO IN THE MIDST OF A PUBLI
  HEALTH CRISIS , DONALD TRUMP  AND JOE BIDEN WHO IN THEIR  ADMINISTRATION CREATED THE MOST  EXTENSIVE PUBLIC HEALTH  COVERAGE WE'VE EVER SEEN WITH  THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT ALSO  KNOWN AS OBAMA CARE AND DEAL  DONALD TRUMP RIGHT NOW IS IN  COURT TRYING TO GET RID OF IT? WITH HIS BOY BILL BAR TRYING  TO GET RID OF THE AFFORDABLE  CARE ACT THAT BROUGHT COVERAGE  OVER 20 MILLION PEOPLE THAT  SAID IF YOU HAVE PRE-EXISTING  CONDITIONS THINGS LIKE DIABETES  DO YOU KNOW ANYBODY WHO HAS  DIABETES?

(APPLAUSE) . >> KAMALA HARRIS: SO WE ARE  GOING TO FIGHT WE ARE GOING TO  EXPAND MEDICARE JOE BIDEN IS  GOING TO BRING DOWN MEDICARE  ELIGIBILITY AGE 60S WORKING TO  BRING DOWN PRESCRIPTION DRUG  COSTS REGULAR PRESERVE SOCIAL  SECURITY AND THE PROMISE WE  MADE TO OUR SENIORS (APPLAUSE). >> KAMALA HARRIS: WE ARE GOING  TO EXPAND COVERAGE UNDER THE  AFFORDABLE CARE ACT TO INCLUDE  MENTAL HEALTH CARE BECAUSE  FOLKS HAVE BEEN TRAUMATIZED. AND WE'VE GOT TO START TREATING  HEALTHCARE AS IF THE BODY  STARTS FROM THE NECK DOWN LET'S  DEAL WITH HEALTHCARE FROM THE  NECK UP (APPLAUSE). >> KAMALA HARRIS: THESE ARE THE  THINGS WERE GOING TO DO. AND BY THE WAY IN THOSE DEBATES  AS PER USUAL, YOU CAN RELY ON  DONALD TRUMP TO ENGAGE IN  DISTORTIONS AND BASICALLY LIED  TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE SO LET'S  BE CLEAR ABOUT THIS JOE BIDEN  WILL NOT INCREASE TAXES ON  ANYONE WHO MAKES LESS THAN  $400,000 YEAR. (APPLAUSE). >> KAMALA HARRIS: THERE ARE A  LOT OF ISSUES A PLACE SO MANY  ISSUES APPLY UNDER SO MUCH AT  STAKE AND I WANT TO, JUST  LANDED I JUST LANDED THIS IS MY  FIRST STOP TODAY AND I WANTED  TO COME HERE TO SEE YOU FOR THE  KICKOFF OF EARLY VOTING.

IN FLORIDA HAVE BEEN READING  ABOUT ASIDE FROM THE INCREDIBLE  LEADERSHIP YOU GOT IN  CONGRESSMAN VAL DEMINGS AND  BILL NELSON WHO WAS A GREAT  FRIEND I KNOW YOU'VE GOT SOME  OTHER ELECTED OFFICIALS OF THE  STATE TO THAT AREN'T DOING  NECESSARILY WHAT'S IN THE BEST  INTEREST OF ALL THE PEOPLE.

TRYING TO SUGGEST TO US THAT WE  DON'T MATTER WE CAN SEE THAT. WE KNOW THAT THAT'S NOT NEW TO  US. AND IN THE FACE OF THESE  MOMENTS WE ASK OURSELVES A  QUESTION. WHY ARE SO MANY  POWERFUL PEOPLE TRYING TO GET  IN THE WAY OF US VOTING? WHY ARE THESE POWERFUL PEOPLE  TRIED TO SUGGEST WE CAN'T TRUST  THE SYSTEM PUTTING IN PLACE  LAWS THAT ARE DESIGNED TO  SUPPRESS THE VOTE. TRYING TO PURGE THEVOTER ROLLS  TRYING TO MAKE IT DIFFICULT WHY  ARE THEY DOING THAT . AND THE ANSWER IS OF COURSE WE  KNOW IS THIS. BECAUSE THEY KNOW WHEN WE VOTE  WE WIN. (APPLAUSE). >> SEN.

PRON i call PRON a cover up PRON do not let PRON know i january what PRON know on january can PRON imagine if PRON all know if PRON know on january what PRON know can PRON imagine what parent and

america but folk be work without pay family leave without pay sick leave what people might have do to prepare but PRON do not tell the american people PRON cover PRON up and now PRON look at be PRON be and PRON be in the midst of four crisis happen at the same time in the moment be PRON be also witness the great failure of any presidential administration in the history of america applause kamala harris so PRON be look at a public health crisis which i describe as be a crisis of proportion in term of the loyalist of life like PRON have not see since world war ii over approach human being PRON life lose so many who could not PRON could even be because the nature of the virus with PRON family in the last day PRON be look at over million people contract the virus be look over million people who have to fly for a new file for unemployment insurance PRON be look at PRON child so many of whom do not have access to broadband much less have a laptop and be try to now figure out how to get the education that PRON deserve because of the god give talent PRON have and how that should be nurture but yet there be no access and no meaningful access to the education PRON need these day lose because of this virus that this man have an opportunity to deal with but deny fact deny science and lie to the american people so PRON know PRON need a change anna change be come applause kamala harris in the middle of PRON all donald trump have this weird obsession with try to get rid of barack obama and joe biden create have PRON notice that PRON be this weird obsession right and so in the midst of a publi n health crisis donald trump and joe biden who in PRON administration create the most extensive public health coverage PRON have ever see with the affordable care act also know as obama care and deal donald trump right now be in court try to get rid of PRON with PRON boy bill bar try to get rid of the affordable care act that bring coverage over million people that say if PRON have pre existing condition thing like diabete do PRON know anybody who have diabete pre existing condition like high blood pressure breast cancer all of these thing now cover because of the affordable care act and donald trump be in court try to touch soon to get rid of PRON but PRON be not go to let PRON PRON be not go to let PRON because what PRON know and what joe know PRON access to healthcareshould be a right and not just the privilege of those who can afford PRON applause kamala harris so PRON be go to fight PRON be go to expand medicare joe biden be go to bring down medicare eligibility age work to bring down prescription drug cost regular preserve social security and the promise PRON make to PRON senior applause kamala harris PRON be go to expand coverage under the affordable care act to include mental health care because folk have be traumatize and PRON have get to start treat healthcare as if the body start from the neck down let PRON deal with healthcare from the neck up applause kamala harris these be the thing be go to do and by the way in those debate as per usual PRON can rely on donald trump to engage in distortion and basically lie to the american people so let PRON be clear about this joe biden will not increase taxis on anyone who make less than $ year applause kamala harris there be a lot of issue a place so many issue apply under so much at stake and i want to just land i just land this be PRON first stop today and i want to come here to see PRON for the kickoff of early voting to thank PRON to thank PRON to thank PRON because as much as PRON have be try to destroy PRON democracy the one thing i know be that when the people be prepared to fight for PRON country base on love of country PRON can never do PRON any harm because PRON will stand up and PRON will march and PRON will organize and PRON will vote and PRON will fight for PRON country applause kamala harris so PRON know what be at stake and here be the bottom line in florida have be read about aside from the incredible leadership PRON get in congressman val demings and bill nelson who be a great friend i know PRON have get some other elect official of the state to that be not do necessarily what be in the good interest of all the people and so i want to say this PRON know when PRON see these example of people try to make PRON difficult for folk to vote and PRON be happen all over the country people try to suppress the vote donald trump try to confuse people about the integrity of PRON voting system try to suggest that PRON can not trust PRON but PRON know better and PRON know when somebody try to play PRON PRON know when somebody be try to pull the wool over PRON eye try to discourage PRON try to deflate PRON enthusiasm try to suggest to PRON that PRON do not matter PRON can see that PRON know that that be not new to PRON and in the face of these moment PRON ask PRON a question why be so many powerful people try to get in the way of PRON voting why be these powerful people try to suggest PRON can not trust the system put in place law that be design to suppress the vote try to purge thevoter roll try to make PRON difficult why be PRON do that and

141,bxuykoOlwjA,harris,2020-10-20T01:00:12Z,"Trump blasts Joe Biden, mocks Kamala Harris at Tucson, Arizona rally | FULL",speech,oh thank you thank you what a crowd wow wow thank you doosan thank you tousan wow [Applause] well thank you very much tucson i'm thrilled to be in arizona with the thousands of loyal hard-working american patriots 15 days from now we're going to win the state of arizona and we are going to win four more years in that beautiful white house everybody needs to get out and vote return your absentee ballot or vert you know you can go out there i think today when do you do it today tomorrow whatever you can go and vote today they say today go out and vote that beats a ballot do you agree that beats a ballot remember the old-fashioned days when you'd actually go out and vote today they send you millions of ballots are you okay over there everyone fine good okay he looks better than i do that guy he looks better than i do good thank you you make sure you're okay with your vote we'll continue to cut your taxes and regulations maintain energy independence which we have now strengthen our military support our police protect our second amendment i don't know i don't see you people i don't think you're going to want to give up those guns i don't think so that's not that's not for arizona defend our borders arrest violent criminals and confirm more judges to uphold the rule of law under my leadership prosperity will surge what we've done in the last three and a half years has been incredible nobody's ever done what we've done there is no administration that's accomplished what we've accomplished in the first three and a half years not even close optimism will boom the pandemic it's rounding the turn the vaccines are coming and i look fine don't i you know and we'll get back to a normal life that's what we want just the normal just seven months ago we want to get back it will be better than that very soon we built a foundation that's so strong and you see what's happening stock market through the roof your 401ks through the roof your stocks through the roof you're housing through the roof everything is good your optimism and what about 56 of the people just a gallup poll just came out 56 of the people say they're better off today than they were four years ago and we have a pandemic and next year will be the greatest economic year in the history of our country that's what's going to happen we're cutting your taxes they're raising your taxes that's uh an easy one to figure out isn't it this election is a choice between a trump super recovery or a biden depression if he even gets to run [Applause] it's a choice between getting a safe vaccine and getting back in and working and by the way you have a governor here today he's done a great job and he's kept you open you're open unlike some of them like michigan you know we won the case in michigan you know the only one that was allowed to have a good time was the governor's husband he was allowed to do whatever the hell he wanted but nobody else they were like in a prison but we're gonna have a safe vaccine and uh biden you know what he's gonna do lock him down let's lock everybody down but we built the greatest economy ever we had to close it down we saved millions of lives by doing what we did then we built it back up and now we're doing record type numbers and it's a choice between the american dream or a socialist nightmare that's what it is biden will delay therapies postpone the vaccine prolong the pandemic close your schools and shut down our country and we're opening and we're opening rapidly and we've got a v-shape it may be a super v it looks like it's a super v which nobody ever even heard of before he will massively raise your taxes bury your you will be buried in regulations you know we cut regulations it would take 18 to 21 years to get a highway approved we have it down to one year and you know what from two to one we're very shortly to be exact right now it's less than two we're gonna have it down to one year and it may get rejected for environmental reasons or safety and that's okay probably not but that's okay but you know what you're gonna have it approved or not approved and it's a one-year process not a 21-year process and this has gone on all over the country and in my opinion what we've done on regulations is even more important than the biggest tax cut in the history of our country i think it's more important and they're going to bring all those regulations back they want to dismantle your police departments dissolve your borders dissolve your borders if you don't have borders you don't have a country confiscate your guns ban american energy wipe out private health care 180 million people terminate religious liberty this is for the women the women who live in the suburbs they want to destroy your suburbs and i ended the rule that was going to destroy i ended the regulation that was going to destroy i kept hearing that women from the suburbs won't like trump i said why because i'm stopping crime you're going to have suburbs be safe suburbs you're having safe suburbs and you're not going to have low income housing projects built next to your house we ended the regulation that would have destroyed your suburbs it's amazing how the women liked me all of a sudden [Applause] and as you know the democrats they want to cut our military to the bone and we built the greatest military right now in the history of our country frankly in the history of the world biden will surrender your jobs to china he will surrender your future to the virus and he will surrender your country to the radical socialist left and you see that happening the only thing biden wants to do is get as much as he can for himself have you been watching this whole thing player i didn't know anything about it oh here's a picture of biden playing golf with this paper i didn't know my son was taking money from barista i didn't know my son got three and a half billion dollars from the mayor of moscow's wife i wonder why and then you see all the things right that we have to give the man 10 we have to give the man 10 right oh boy [Applause] i'll tell you what nobody's ever seen and the media right and big tech they won't they won't allow it charlie kirk you know charlie kirk great guy they shut down his site because he mentioned it look he's a corrupt politician this guy he's a corrupt politician to get the power biden has made a corrupt bargain in exchange for his party's nomination he has handed control of his party over to the socialists the communist the marxist and the left-wing extremists and that's before we get to his own personal corruption which is more than anybody in history i say this it's the second biggest scandal politically in the history of our country number one was spying on my campaign and getting caught biden even shows as his running mate the most liberal senator in america kamala kamala senator kamala harris is a sponsor of the socialist green new deal and legislation to strip away the private health plans of 180 million americans and you know her and bernie sanders want to do something in arizona they have some deal in arizona where your taxes are going to go way up you know that right your governor who's right over here your great governor was saying he's not happy with it but bernie sanders the second most liberal person you know she's first right she's considered they want to raise your taxes eight and a half percent so i'm glad right governor he's saying more it's probably more what is the name of that governor rule what right you know about it okay you can't have a mint because they control biden 100 biden is shot you know he's shot right these guns though harris also urged their supporters to donate to a fund that bailed out the riot as the ones that knocked out your towns your cities not in republican areas by the way all in democrat areas you look at portland how about that we would have taken 15 minutes we could have solved that we told the governor democrat let us in we'll solve that problem we went into minneapolis it took us a half an hour that was over with unfortunately they could have called a little earlier and in seattle they gave up when they heard we were going in the next morning but we would tell look all democrat areas new york going to hell i feel so sad with new york crime is up 200 250 cuomo a terrible thing has happened in new york look at chicago democrat again crime is through the roof they had a weekend 87 people were shot and 16 died okay now do you believe this isn't hey we're in afghanistan you don't lose many people we're coming out by the way it's all coming we're all coming back home but you go to war zones you don't have that and we could solve it so easily thank you thank you thank you you know there's never been that chance before seriously we all liked ronald reagan i guess he'd be but he never had that share we love you thank you dad we love you you're gonna make me cry don't do that i don't want to cry i don't want to cry [Music] make me cry you'll destroy my image and then you won't love me anymore that'll be terrible i appreciate it now i do and i feel the same way that's why i'm doing this i had a good life before i did this stuff believe me my life was very simple and very nice the democrat parties warren cops is inciting riots and putting police officers and american families in very grave danger unlike joe biden i will always support the heroes of law enforcement and i was endorsed by almost every law enforcement group in the united states including new york's finest and chicago and florida and texas and oklahoma and every place and i was just named i have to say this happened today the man of the year in their big magazine the blue magazine good name for man of the year so i just tell you that for whatever reason i tell you i'm the only one standing between you and a left-wing crusade you know you have people they want to change our whole country and the thing that's going to bring us back together a success because i'll tell you we were ready i was getting calls seven months ago we had the best employment numbers we ever had with the greatest success we've ever had we were beating china at everything you know you kept hearing about we were beating everybody and they were calling me people that i wouldn't be speaking to generally let's get together it was happening and then we got hit by the china plague and then we had to start all over again but it will success brings us together i saw it and i we saw it for two months it was really going on a new study of the biden harris agenda found that their plans will crater the typical american family by more than six thousand five hundred dollars their horrible horrible plans to finance what the blue the new the new green deal the green new deal is the craziest thing right no more airplanes no more double cars no more cows if you have a ranch you won't have cows anymore no more you you'll be next in just three years i increased family income by six thousand dollars and we're not even talking about the energy did you ever think you'd be seeing two dollar gasoline again and you got that and it's plentiful and we saved all our energy jobs all of our energy jobs we saved biden will eviscerate the middle class my policies will lift the middle class to record highs and that's where we're going very quickly for the last 47 years sleepy joe biden shipped away your jobs shut down your factories threw open your borders and ravaged our cities while sacrificing american blood and treasure in these endless ridiculous foreign wars in countries you've never even heard of joe biden is a servant of the left-wing globalists and lobbyists the wealthy donors the washington vultures who got rich bleeding america dry you know they raise a lot of money the democrats you know why because they make deals they make deals i would be the greatest fundraiser in history if i wanted to call wall street i know them all i want 10 million dollars for my campaign yes sir all i have to say is i want 10 million i want 15 i want 25. i would set every record but you know what happens when you do that you're selling yourself out when you have to do something you can't do it anymore because you feel guilty [Applause] you see them setting all sorts of records i know what the records are the records every time they set a record they gave away everything in 2016 you voted to fire this corrupted decrepit political establishment and you elected an outsider as president who is finally putting america first it's about time joe biden as always and always has been a corrupt politician joe biden is a corrupt politician and you know what you knew that and a lot of people knew it for a long time but now you have the laptop it's over it's over and as far as i'm concerned the biden family is a criminal enterprise and that's what it is it's a criminal enterprise smoking gun emails shown we just found them you saw that did you see a shifty shift we think that the uh laptop was made by russia oh i see oh oh he just said it was made by russia here we go again russia did it russia russia russia you know the head of dni john ratliff was fantastic came out and said that was false information now these are bad people these are sick people do you notice they never say it was made by china because they're all on the tank smoking gun email show just came out that the biden family used the vice presidency as a for-profit cash machine and that joe biden has been lying to the american public to cover it up remember he said no i never met anybody from barista is it is it barista actually that i understand because he's got no memory left it's gonza is it barista no i don't really and then they show a picture of him playing golf with the head of barista ah boy oh boy if biden wins china wins and china will own the usa remember what i said the media and big tech is trying to hide the entire scandal do you believe what they're doing they're taking people like a charlie kirk and others off if they even mention that biden is corrupt and they know he's corrupt but he's there corrupt he's so perfect for them he's there corrupt because they know that publicizing these revelations would mean an end of biden's presidential run i think it's an end right now look you know i think it's an end right now how the hell can you do when you see the kind of things that they do where the big guy has to get at least 10 percent the big guy i wonder who the big guy is t i wonder when you see what if you put him as president you should be ashamed of yourselves you want to know the truth i'm not just running against biden i'm running against the left-wing media the big tech giants and the washington swamp and i've been running against it from the beginning and here i am all by myself it's true oh yeah yeah anybody else that would have been in a corner right now thumb in mouth saying mommy take me home mommy i want to go home now it's uh it's great you know why it's great though because nobody's ever done what we've done [Applause] they flood your communities with criminal aliens drugs and crime while they live behind beautiful gated communities they try to take away your guns while they enjoy private securities fully armed by the way how fully armed how about bloomberg we are fighting guns and he's got five guys around him with guns they support crippling lockdowns while their jobs and their industry remain totally exempt it's time to send a message to these wealthy liberal hypocrites in washington and in silicon valley show them the american people are in charge by delivering their chosen candidate sleepy joe biden who shouldn't even be their candidate he should have lost because elizabeth pocahontas warren if she would have dropped out the day before super tuesday joe would have lost every single state to crazy bernie it's a very simple business but we have to show them the democrats a thundering defeat on november 3rd and if i don't sound like a typical washington politician it's because i'm not a politician if i don't always play by the rules of the washington establishment it's because i was elected to fight for you harder than anyone has ever fought for you which is true and i'm fighting so hard i had a great life i'm fighting so hard because i love my country and because i'm determined to ensure that the forgotten men and women of this country are never forgotten again and they won't be they won't be and we taught that lesson to him four years ago but we're going to teach him again because this is the most important you know i used to go a few months ago say well i don't know this is important that's important which is more important this is the most important election in the history of our country divided agenda would be a catastrophe for arizona seniors do we have any seniors in the house biden is pledging mass amnesty and free federal health care for illegal aliens you saw that where he was up on the stage with his radical left democrats who's willing to give free health care to illegal immigrants right they said to illegal immigrants right and everybody raised their hand and biden couldn't get us up because he knew you know he's been doing this crap for 47 years right he's gone he couldn't he knew it was wrong but then he looked and his brain is shot so he looked over there and the hands were all up then he looked over there and the hands were all up there were a lot of them he knew it was wrong because it would be so horrible for our country because everyone's going to flood our country you get free health care right you get free health care you get free education i jokingly said and everybody gets a rolls royce and cnn said that's a lie so what happened is he couldn't get it up and then he looked and he looked and he got it up and i said thank you we just won the election he would decimate medicare if he did that and it's not going to be up to him that's his party that's what they want they want socialized medicine and he'll destroy your social security while i'm president no one will touch your medicare or your social security you know the amazing thing biden's always complaining oh he didn't stop china fast enough except he didn't want to stop him at all you know little things like this but you know he's always complaining and yet he was here for 47 years right i said joe joe it's not like you're an outsider and it wasn't that long ago either 47 years and all he does is complain biden had 47 years to fight for seniors and reduced prescription drug costs and look what i've done and i've just exercised they're going to come down 70 80 90 percent because i just did something that nobody thought anybody would do a favorite nation's flaws we pay the lowest in the world you'll see numbers that are shocking they're not happy with me the big pharma big pharma is spending a lot of money when you see those ads please remember every one of those ads means your drug prices are coming down they can't believe it i tried to make a deal with them i did i tried but we couldn't in the end we couldn't it got too greedy too much money too much money but you know last year we brought drug prices down one percent i'm not bragging about it's the first time in 52 years that drug prices came down but now we're going for the big one now we're going for the big one and you know rebates you know the richest people the middlemen you know the middlemen about drugs you know that we have middlemen nobody knows who the hell they are never hear middle women i hear middlemen so we'll make it politically correct middle men middle no they're called middlemen nobody knows who they are these guys are so rich who are they i'll bet you hunter gets a piece of the action hunter biden is a middleman on top of everything else he gets it from china he gets it from ukraine he got three and a half million from russia from moscow he got three and a half and on top of everything else he's a middle man now i'll bet he is he probably gets a piece of the action but instead he sold seniors out to the drug lobby into big pharma that's biden senior i'm taking on the powerful special interest like never before nobody's ever done this before nobody's ever done it before i mean you know for years you heard about drug prices nobody ever did anything and now you hear about drug prices and they're dropping they're going to be dropping like a rock also i'm letting your governor your great governor buy until the thing kicks in and probably litigation but you know i've exercised this whole thing with favored nations so if germany pays 10 cents for a pill and we're paying two and a half dollars and you have that kind of disparities ridiculous that we have the right to match in other words we get the lowest price but until it kicks in canada pays half of what we pay so i'm letting your governor and other governors go to canada buy your drugs through canada save 50 we get rid of the middlemen the other thing we did very big much less than what we're talking about but very big we capped insulin costs for medicine and medicare for medicare plans at less than 35 a month people were dying because they couldn't afford insulin 33 million seniors 33 think of this 35 but 33 million seniors on medicare will soon be receiving two hundred dollars to help with their drug course on top of everything else nobody's done by the way in all fairness nobody has done anything like this but your big thing your big thing is going to be when you see what happens with the favored nations because you've been hearing about it for years where other countries are paying a tiny fraction of what we we bear all of the cost because our politicians sold us out they sold us out but i'm not a politician so it's one of the i couldn't stand watching it to battle the china virus we launched the largest mobilization since world war ii our early and aggressive action saved more than two million lives i acted early to ban travel from china and cha how about this you should have done it sooner but in the meantime when i did it he called me xenophobic right and then months later he agreed that i was right and now he's saying i should have done it sooner this guy i also banned it from europe because i saw with italy and with spain and with france and by the way they have a big spike right now they have a very big spike right now and we're doing good we are rounding the turn we have the vaccines coming and all but even without we're rounding the turn people are pandemiced out you know that they're pandemiced out that's why it's so great what your governor's done he's opened up your state you're doing great we pioneered life's and by the way you get it you know like i say here i am i'm here i'm here and now i'm immune i can jump into this audience and kiss every man and woman i'm immune right they say [Applause] [Music] it used to be your immune for life and then when i got it i said i'm immune they said it's only good for four months see if anybody else you understand that right i'll jump into that audience right there [Applause] we pioneered life-saving therapies and reduced the fatality rate 85 think of it and i had it too i didn't feel good i feel not so great and i'm not used to that and we can't let that happen to a president because we not we have to be at the top of our game that's why you can't let biden be president because he's not at the top of his game mentally can't have that one thing i can tell you putin president xi of china kim jong-un all of them macron they're very much at the top of their game you can't let this happen to our country you can't but i was i was laying and you know if you're president one thing you're guaranteed lots of doctors and they would grab me and they grabbed me by every part they had hands all over me i said get the hell out of here i just don't feel good and we ended up i used the drug regeneron which nobody ever thought about six months ago and i woke up the next morning and i was like i felt like superman get me out of here i said get me out of here and eli lilly makes a similar product and we're going to distribute that we're trying to get emergency use so we can do it faster because it's early but it's fantastic antibodies and we're going to distribute it all over and we're going to make sure that people that have a problem that get the same drug as i got and i'm telling you it'll be the same result it'll be the same result and it's free we're going to do it free companies are working with us because it's not their fault it's china's fault it's not their fault but i woke up and i felt good i said get me out of here boom superman through operation warp speed we will have 100 million vaccine doses before the end of the year and our military is going to distribute them and they are there's nobody like our military [Applause] the vaccine will end the pandemic but even without the vaccine the pandemic is ending it's going to end it ends with it but you know this can this can go quickly this can make it go a lot faster biden's locked down we'll crush america my plan will crush the virus and bring back your american dream so we're joined today by some very special people a friend of mine somebody that's been with me from the beginning i've been with him from the beginning he's very difficult because when he needs something for the state like money he'll call me all the time i say doug do me a favor give me a break but i guess that's what you're supposed to do right that's what you want he's supposed to call and finally i'll say all right doug you got it get out of here promise not to call then he'll call me two weeks later i need more but he's a great governor one of the greatest governors he's done a fantastic job you're down to very low numbers by the way doug ducey doug please and we want you to vote for martha mcsally save your second amendment save your second amendment doug you want to come up come up doug come here for a second come on doug i'll tell you this guy has been a great guy i don't know if you like him

mcsally on november 3rd will join them in the u.s senate mr president because of your policies arizona's economy is booming our home values are rising faster than anywhere else in the nation and amy coney barrett will be confirmed to the supreme court [Applause] joe biden is wrong for america joe biden would lock us down joe biden would reduce your income 65 hundred dollars and joe biden would make washington dc estate and and how many presidents of the united states would protect arizona by talking about what bernie sanders wants to do here by endorsing prop 208 wanting to raise our taxes 77 percent so on november 3rd vote no on prop 208 and vote yes for donald trump and mike pence to go back to the white house [Applause] thank you doug he's a great governor he's a great great governor

great job and she's a worker and she's a great fighter pilot they told me all about her some of the pilots they said she was a great fighter pilot so thank you martha thank you thank you doug we also have a congressional candidate that they say is a star in the making i've heard it from a lot of people vote for brandon martin where's brandon brandon good luck man i hear it's going going good good thank you brandon brandon martin thank you brandon you're gonna do great i heard you're doing really well under my administration we built the greatest economy in the history of the world and now we're doing it again you know it's make america great again right i say make america great again again again and again we did it and now we had to do it again it's all right it's happening and it's happening much faster looks like a super v in my first three years we increased family income more than five times the gains in all eight years under the last administration think of that five times more in the first three years five times more than eight years of the obama biden administration that's not even believable african-american unemployment hispanic american unemployment asian american unemployment all reached record lows the lowest in the history of our country we lifted 6.6 million americans out of poverty including more than 1.5 million hispanic americans that's a record and i'm doing very well in the polls with hispanic americans but i always like you and you always like me the fake news just didn't know that our policies are lifting up all americans of every income since the china virus we created 11.4 million american jobs it's a record too nobody's ever seen anything like that you know the unemployment rate normally i wouldn't be happy about this right but the unemployment rate a week ago hit 7.8 percent think of that now we were hearing 42 it's going to go to 42 it's going to go to 44. it's going to go to 38. 7.8 and heading this way think of that would you believe that normally i wouldn't say it because we were at 3.4 3.5 and heading even better than that but that's okay we'll be there soon after the virus left china we the smallest contraction of any major western country and the fastest recovery anywhere in the world from an economy standpoint and we've already cut the unemployment rate in less than half that's a fantastic thing under biden and obama it took over three and a half years for arizona to regain 60 percent of the jobs lost in the crisis and we've done it in four months think of that and it wasn't our fault wasn't our fault manufacturing production is up 61 retail sales are up excuse me 121 [Applause] that means more than before the pandemic and automobile production nobody's going to believe this one is up 350 percent since april lows 350 i have a way that we can stop it elect sleepy joe no no you're for who has a 401k okay so if i told you that your 401ks and you're all at record highs are very close right if i told you that your 401ks will be cut in half and much worse than that that's what's going to happen you're going to end up in a depression with this guy he's going to raise your taxes by four or five times and they're going to put on regulations every company is going to say let's get out of here because i'll tell you the regulation cuts which are more than anybody than any administration's ever done the regulation cuts in their own way were more important than the biggest tax cut in the history of our country thank you man as president i've been delivering for our incredible hispanic american community like nobody has done before and i'm fighting for school choice safe neighborhoods and hispanic-owned small businesses joe biden would wipe out your small businesses with lockdowns and regulations you know he said the other day oh i'd lock it down oh great that's thanks a lot joe we appreciate it and devastate your families with massive tax hikes he will wage war on catholic organizations ban charter schools fund extreme late term abortion and he'll let socialists run wild and we will never have a socialist country we will never have it we can't we won't have a conflict that's why we're going to win a record share of the hispanic vote this november get out and vote get out and vote for decades our politicians spent trillions of dollars rebuilding foreign nations fighting foreign wars defending foreign borders but now we are finally protecting our nation rebuilding our cities we are protecting our borders you know the wall is almost finished right our southern border and by the way the biggest beneficiary maybe happens to be arizona that wall how good is the wall the governor was telling me before they stopped coming in now they come in they come in legally now the wall is great goes down deep and it goes up high no more tunneling and we're bringing our jobs our factories our troops back home in the usa where they belong right under my leadership we achieved the most secure border in u.s history our southern border is now and i want to thank mexico mexico has right now 27 000 troops guarding our border how about that and we built almost 400 miles of the wall we're averaging about 10 miles a day and it's the best it's exactly what border patrol wanted i said i'd like to just put up i'd just like to put up concrete plank they said no sir we got to have it this way sir we gave them the ultimate we gave them everything they wanted and they're really happy and it's had a huge impact we've got the best we've got the best border that we've ever had and you know what you have a big chunk of it right here and it's really worked you have 200 miles they tell me 200 miles 200 miles i didn't even know you had that's a lot of mileage you're not paying a damn cent for it either all compliments of the federal government remember when nancy pelosi they all said we don't need a wall walls are obsolete two things don't get obsolete walls and wheels right everything else is obsolete you know they developed a new chip yesterday in about 15 minutes it's going to be obsolete they developed a new computer 15 minutes obsolete the two things that will never be obsolete a wheel and a wall remember the democrats they said no we want drones we want drones so you can have drones watching everybody pour into the country nothing nope 200 miles of wall in arizona and you got it all it it's all done joe biden's party continues to attack our incredible border agents and they are more than half of whom happen to be hispanic americans i know a lot of them right there yeah this are guys here am i right right the republican party will always stand with the heroes of ice and border patrol these are incredible people they're doing an incredible job my opponent's immigration plan is the most extreme proposal ever put forward biden's plan would eliminate u.s borders by implementing nationwide catch him they want nationwide catch and really you know what catching releases you catch them take their name they could be murderers rapists and then you release them into our country guess what we don't do that anymore okay that wasn't easy but it would have made every community into and they want to make every community into a sanctuary city and they want to suspend all removals of illegal aliens so what they're doing and this is done by crazy bernie right you know bernie sanders made a deal we caught the manifesto with joe biden and it's further left than bernie ever was joe did a great job of negotiation supposed to bring him to the right he brought him to the left it would mean the total nullification of u.s borders overwhelming every city in town in america ms-13 and criminal cartels would rampage throughout our country freely if biden wins your borders are gone which means your health care is gone the middle class is gone and your safety is gone other than that he's doing quite a good job from the moment i took office i worked night and day to stop illegal immigration it wasn't easy and now we've got it [Applause] and stopping it for arizona was a that was a big deal i ended catch and release i closed the lobbyist loopholes i took down the smugglers and coyotes these are not nice people by the way and i kept my promise to the american people we are finding the drug dealers all over and we are arresting the drug dealers like they have never been arrested before we're finding the predators we're finding the gang members we're finding ms-13 killers and we are either throwing them in jail or sending them the hell back home where they came from we invested 2.5 trillion dollars in our military we have the greatest equipment now anywhere in the world and you know when i first got here a very highly overrated general told me sir we have no ammunition i said no president should ever hear that we have no ammunition truly this was a general who i didn't have a lot of respect for but he said we had no ammunition so i said well we're gonna have to do something we got 2.5 trillion dollars we now are the envy of the world we have weapons the likes of which nobody in the world has russia china nobody and for our vets we pass va choice and va accountability we killed the leader of isis al-baghdadi [Applause] and we took out the world's number one terrorist and mass murderer of american troops and many many people salamander is dead [Applause] i withdrew from the last administration's disastrous iran nuclear deal 150 billion dollars 1.8 billion in cash not the best deal it would have been ending now almost anyway i recognized the true capital of israel and opened the american embassy in jerusalem i also recognized israeli sovereignty over the golan heights they've been working on that for 52 years i got it done in two hours and instead of the endless wars we're forging peace in the middle east no blood in the sand i did more in 47 months than joe biden did in 47 years [Applause] a vote for republicans is a vote for safe communities great jobs a limitless future and for the american dream it's for the american dream remember you know the republican party is the party of abraham lincoln right the party of america you know abraham lincoln i tell that to people they never know they said gee i never knew that but abraham honest abe was a special person but in conclusion over the next four years we will make america into the manufacturing superpower of the world and we will end our reliance on china once and for all it's already happening we will hire more police increase penalties for assaults and law enforcement and we will ban deadly sanctuary cities we will uphold religious liberty free speech and the right to keep and bear arms will strike down terrorists who threaten our citizens and we will keep america out of these ridiculous foreign wars foreign wars countries you've never even heard of we will maintain america's unrivaled military might and we will ensure peace through strength we will end surprise medical billing require price transparency it's already done it's all signed starts on january 1st it'll be more important watch than healthcare it'll be even more important i'm telling you it's the numbers you're talking about price transparency remember further reduce the cost of prescription drugs and we will always protect patients with pre-existing conditions always [Applause] america will land the first woman on the moon and the united states will be the first nation to land an astronaut on mars it's happening soon and nasa is now the space center of the world again it was a mess we will stop the radical indoctrination of our students and restore patriotic education to our schools we will teach our children to love our country

143,tes38JVOLM0,harris,2020-10-21T01:47:37Z,"Kamala Harris gets REAL with CJ McCollum, Donovan Mitchell, and Tobias: Remaking America Roundtable",speech,ladies and gentlemen good afternoon from the flight deck we're cruising at 37 000 feet we just passed over the coast we'll be beginning our descent about 30 minutes i'd like to take this opportunity to welcome you to america [Music] that all men are created groundwork is being laid right now from generations that have come before them to continue to try to bring about change 10 to 15 people can change an entire election which can change what happens in your community we have this amazing opportunity to get out shift what's going on let's fight with conviction to the america we know is possible i'm cj mccullum nba athlete journalist entrepreneur and so much more today i'm going to be speaking to some of my good friends tobias harris from the philadelphia 76ers donovan mitchell from the utah jazz and special special guest senator kamala harris i'm hoping to accomplish a lot today first and foremost to just have a great discussion about some of the issues that are going on in society today we want to continue to urge people to get out and vote understanding that the right to vote is the privilege and the honor and something that we should all continue to step step forward and complete understanding that in society there are a lot of ways in which you can promote change but it starts with speaking out and using your voice and i think based on some of the things our ancestors have fought for you're doing yourself a disservice if you don't go out and take advantage of the things that they've allowed us to do first and foremost i want to welcome our very very special guest senator kamala harris i appreciate you coming on thank you cj i brought some friends of mine donovan mitchell to buy his hairs who are big in the community they believe in using their platforms continue to find ways to speak out but not just speaking out figuring out ways to to have actionable change so i felt like this would be a great opportunity for us to discuss what's going on in our world today and figure out ways in which we can create change in our world for us personally we've had a lot of interesting development over the last few months coming out of a bubble obviously there's a lot of stuff that occurred while we were in the bubble and we had to figure out ways to use our platform and speak out for those who don't necessarily have a voice so i like to start with donovan mitchell obviously you had an incredible playoff run but i think what you did in terms of speaking out was what's even more impressive so just kind of walk us through your thought process as an athlete who tries to use his platform yeah you know i think the biggest thing you know for myself is you know no voice is too little i think obviously me being a young guy and i think the great thing about the league that as you guys know have been in the league for so long is just the voices are getting younger you know we we were having making a huge push to go out and vote you know focusing on education finding ways to at least inform you know people can have their own opinions but at least we're educated on all fronts you know so for myself just find a way to continue to educate people you know and give back to the community my mom being a teacher and what and and and she's instilled that in me um but that was really one of the biggest things for me going into the bubble was the play was going to take care of itself but i wanted to be able to give back knowledge you know i think that's really what carries and goes a long way i'm diamond mitchell i play for the utah jazz i'm from greenwich connecticut i'm here to interview senator harris it's funny you know i went to private school in connecticut about third grade you know and then um biggest thing was just i had gone to private school went to play basketball in new york city and it was at the time i didn't realize it but it's just like two polar opposite worlds you know um growing up in new york and playing in new york city basketball then going to private school the the difference was um as a kid you enjoy you embrace it but as and that and i still love it but i think it was just you realize the differences in in the world i went to my friend's house for the first time in private school and i got lost if that tells you how big the house is i got lost inside the house um so as a kid you're like man like this is great you know you're there on the weekend and then you come back home and you're like damn like you and there's a kid you're like man i want a house like that like man i want that you know and that's that's how i grew up you know i grew up and i would always come back to what we would call reality of you know because you know it's a different world like i said senator harris you did a tremendous job in the debate recently being able to hold your own while maintaining composure i think for us as as african-americans we've had to do that a lot throughout our time but can you kind of explain to some of the the listeners at home the importance of voting yes the upcoming election especially men of color and people of color yes i mean there's so much at stake um in this election and part you know we we always every election will talk about the importance of the vote and and i think about it in about three different ways all of which are at play one of the last big events i did before the pandemic struck was to be in selma alabama walking across the edmund pettus bridge with john lewis who is now one of the ancestors right but remember john lewis was the youngest speaker at the march on washington with dr king he he is the one who was at the head of the line of that group of young leaders he was in his 20s when they walked across the edmund pettus bridge and the marshals turned on the crowd and beat them he shed blood on that bridge the edmund pettus bridge and they were marching for the right to vote and for black folks to be able to vote so one way that i think about the importance of voting is honoring the ancestors right all those people like john lewis who is younger than you who shed his blood for us to be able to vote one of the reasons i became a lawyer is because of a great american man by the name of thurgood marshall who was the first black person to serve on the united states supreme court in his career he fought for school desegregation in america and was the reason there was a case in the united states supreme court called brown v board of education that desegregated america's schools who sits on that court matters there is a discrepancy there's a there's a huge difference in education and you know whether it's public private or where you go to public schools in the districts and whatnot and i think you know the biggest thing for me is just trying to let people know you know my mom's a teacher that there is differences you know and i think in order for us to change where we are mentally as a country you have to be informed you have to be educated so that's a lot of it needs to be about public schools and funding public schools the person who the president the current president put into head the department of education has been trying to privatize schools our kids mostly go to public schools joe biden is saying triple the funding for public schools in the lowest income communities right elections matter elections matter when you think about the fact that we need to have a president and leadership in the white house that knows if a black child has a black teacher [Music] by the end of third grade they're 13 more likely to go to college if they have two black teachers before the end of third grade they're double that number likely to go to college and i am living proof of that thank god for mrs francis wilson may she rest in peace who was my first grade teacher and attended my law school graduation right so these are some of the examples of the fact that elections matter because who holds those positions will make such important decisions about our lives i agree wholeheartedly and i think one of the reasons why we're here is to have those types of conversations to drive education to the masses because a lot of times people don't feel like they can create change and i think in the bubble tobias you talked about it having actionable items in which we can drive change and figuring out what's near and dear to our hearts for me it's education reform for you i know you've cared a lot about not only education but police brutality can you speak on kind of what you went through mentally in the bubble seeing some of the things happening to our black and brown brothers and sisters and just maybe kind of pose a question in which we can try to figure out ways collectively to help inspire change yeah so you know for me in the bubble with everything going on with us trying to really bring attention to the brianna taylor case and then to get the result that we did was it made up it made myself personally feel like man like we're bringing all this type of attention and we get a we get a bad result and we we've had bad results with police brutality in the past also so like one thing i would want to know what are way what are ways that it may be different or what are ways you may handle it differently than the our president now has handled it because it just doesn't a lot of it doesn't sit well with myself family members and i know that the african-american community who truly cares and knows that that could be their brother or sister next you know hi my name is tobias harris i'm from long island new york and i play for the philadelphia 76ers and today i'm talking to senator harris as a young african-american you don't truly understand and get the true knowledge of your history and i know personally i didn't get the true knowledge of my history in elementary middle and high school now we learned what the curriculum wanted us to learn so those are always things that for me personally that i will make sure my future kids will understand understand their heritage their where they came from who they are and i think you know as being a quote unquote star athlete throughout high school you know it was like a pass for a lot of things um when i would be out it wasn't like oh that's a six eight black kids like oh that's tobias harris you know so those type of things not to say that they are they were like bad for me personally but it was kind of like it was sugar coated for me well the older i got i was like man i had experience but my experience wasn't you know wasn't what someone else's experience was and i think that you have to learn from that have the sympathy for others experience that are in those in that walk the same journey as you just just a different path there is not a black man i know be he a relative or a friend who has not had some experience with police which has been about an unreasonable stop some kind of profiling or excessive force so it starts with having leadership that speaks the truth about the fact of it we don't have that in the white house right now right he's he's basically trying to say that people who are protesting are looters and they're violent and talking about law and order not understanding peaceful protest is part of how this nation was founded [Music] it was how this nation was founded peaceful protest is what allows me to be the only the second black woman ever elected to the united states senate and allows us to be here right having the rights that we do but there's still a lot of work to be done but it matters who's in a position of leadership and and how they use the mic that's in front of them and part of this on the issue of police brutality is about speaking the truth of it so these are the kinds of things that we have to put in place but it has to start with speaking truth and doing it in a way that understands and accepts that you know as i said and i said it last night bad cops are bad for good cops we need to deal with it and there needs to be consequence because see the thing that i know is that in the criminal justice system there's this this phrase that is often used and the phrase is consequence and accountability there needs to be consequence and accountability it's this phrase is used all the time and almost every time it is used it is directed at the person who was arrested and not at the system itself and the players in the system and that's the problem there needs to be consequence and accountability on behalf of the system itself and the players in the system african-american black people that voters it's important because there was a period of time where we didn't have the right to vote right and that um we had our ancestors walking in numerous amounts of miles to go vote and we have this opportunity to vote and be able to express um our opinion on our political views and our views of what we want to see the world get to so i think voting is important i think that with for the ones that don't want the lord i think our ancestors are like rolling around like are you serious like we we fought like we've had civil leaders down all the way down line fight for we're still fighting for equality in many different areas but voting was one of the things that pushed us to to continue this movement but what you guys are doing in terms of the activism and the and the leadership and and the organizing and the bully pulpit that you each have it's so powerful it's so powerful and the thing is is that what you guys have been doing is it's it's everything about the expression but it's also about then helping people figure out where to go with it and what to demand to your point right these are the things to ask for these are the things to demand looking at where we're at currently in society with covet 19 us having to sit here six feet away yell at each other with masks on it's impacted everything looking at the current administration and their lack of belief in science as a as a person who's big on education and has family that work in health care my future wife is a dentist her father's a dentist i think this this conversation can kind of tie in covet it can tie in healthcare it can tie in education and donovan you grew up in a household in which your mother was a teacher how has covid you know kind of affected the educational systems and then we can kind of tie in hbcus and what that means for our future leaders who are trying to learn via zoom yeah um so my mom's hey sorry to say my mom's an aka she she loves you uh she's back here somewhere excited and you know the best thing about me as a person is the fact that i finally at 24 years old understand that the ball stops at some point and the only thing i will have in life is what's up here took a while but my mom instilled that in me she's been she's been a teacher she just retired and that's really what allowed me to use my voice in the bubble you know and allowed me to really feel comfortable with it you know i went to private school [Music] and public schools so i've seen the two different americas in this world and it's crazy as a kid you put on a different persona when you're in private school than when i'm playing basketball in new york city you know and as a kid that's just that was life i didn't know what it was until i got older and started realizing that there are some friends that went to private school with that have no idea what's happening 45 minutes away in the projects in certain areas no idea how people live yeah and vice versa that's right so for me understanding and having my mom and talking to her about it i was just like how can we continue to find ways to to push education educating blacks whites hispanics asians on each other's history yeah you know because i'm i'm 24 and there are people who are way older than me that don't even know what juneteenth is i know or black wall street i know and i'm informing them and i always wonder you know if we want to get to the ultimate goal of equality you know whether it's through education or systemic racism or voter suppression whatever it is the best thing we can do is inform and if you want to make that decision to choose that then that's your decision but at least you're educated on it if i were to talk to our younger generation you know i say like i'm not young myself but it's on why voting matters i think the biggest thing is understanding you're not just voting for the president of the united states you know you're voting locally if you'd like to see things change locally in your particular state then your vote counts your vote counts regardless of what it is but your vote and being able to to leave your stamp on something and leave your imprint on it i think is something that we really need to take pride in education educate ourselves on why voting matters understanding that if you want for me police brutality is huge for me understanding banging the chokehold you know knee restraints understand that that needs to be banned i think those are certain things that whatever you feel is important to yourself understanding why it is good or is not good who you should and should not vote for um understanding that that happens locally whether it's the governor it's the mayor you know those are the people that make up the police department the fire department make up all these people that you see on a daily basis in your community so understanding that how your vote your one vote plus another person's vote plus another visibility over over 10 to 15 people can change an entire election which can change what happens in your community so understanding that you have the power to change that we need to continue as a people to understand that without our vote you know nothing changes you know young black and brown kids code it right yes a lot of kids don't understand the importance of coding and how necessary it is yes across the world and there's over a half million jobs that are readily available and you only need two years of experience at coding before you could be making 70 to 100 000. that's right so i've really focused on that i think you've done a great job of touching on actionable items in which we can do collectively in which some of our listeners and viewers can do i think tobias had a question in terms of you know how we can remake america obviously with with senator harris yourself with vp biden uh we're on board and we're looking forward to helping solicit change through voting but i think what we want to know collectively especially tobias is what does remaking america look like with your ticket yeah i say look you go to any upper middle class suburb in america you will not see the kind of police presence that you'll see in other communities but what you will see well-funded public schools high rates of home ownership access to capital for small businesses affordable health care and affordable mental health care right people who have jobs that allow them to get to the end of the month and not worry about can they feed their children healthy communities are safe communities so part of how joe and i think about it is we got to invest in the health of all communities and but we do it in a way that is about not only equality but equity so there's a big difference between equality and equity equality suggests oh everyone should get the same amount the problem with that not everybody's starting out from the same place so if we're all getting the same amount but you started up back there and i started out over here we could get the same amount but you're still going to be that far back behind me equity equitable treatment means we all end up at the same place i appreciate you not only coming here but but sharing so much on impactful ways we can all drive change we've all tried to use our voices collectively different ways as african-american men we feel like we have a responsibility yeah you know we we grew up in in certain households where we were privileged enough uh to have both parents around in our lives to push us and allow us to get the education we deserve and a lot of americans don't necessarily have that that choice or that voice so we want to speak out on behalf of them i would encourage you know people to go out and vote personally i'm from canton ohio i live in oregon now i know we've got a lot of east coast guys here as well but i just want to encourage people to to continue to go out and vote i think that's big and i know you're going to be pretty short on time but if there's anything else you guys want to ask ask now or forever hold your piece until the next time just want to say thank you and um looking forward to um seeing the change i think that's that's why we're here that's what we that's why that's why you're here looking forward to be a part of the change and part of history so thank you and um looking forward to it and i'm looking forward to it and personally there's a lot of stuff i do in education but as you've shared i know there's a lot of ways in which we could probably collaborate and work on things together continue to improve society so i'm looking forward to it and we'll continue to talk and and collectively brainstorm actionable ideas but once again i want to encourage everyone to attend iwillvote.com once again iwillvote.com that's extremely important the election is coming soon and we have a chance to to help drive and make real change so thankful for our conversation

different way all of which be at play one of the last big event i do before the pandemic strike be to be in selma alabama walk across the edmund pettus bridge with john lewis who be now one of the ancestor right but remember john lewis be the young speaker at the march on washington with dr king PRON PRON be the one who be at the head of the line of that group of young leader PRON be in PRON when PRON walk across the edmund pettus bridge and the marshal turn on the crowd and beat PRON PRON shed blood on that bridge the edmund pettus bridge and PRON be march for the right to vote and for black folk to be able to vote so one way that i think about the importance of voting be honor the ancestor right all those people like john lewis who be young than PRON who shed PRON blood for PRON to be able to vote one of the reason i become a lawyer be because of a great american man by the name of thurgood marshall who be the first black person to serve on the united states supreme court in PRON career PRON fight for school desegregation in america and be the reason there be a case in the united states supreme court call brown v board of education that desegregate america school who sit on that court matter there be a discrepancy there be a there be a huge difference in education and PRON know whether PRON be public private or where PRON go to public school in the district and whatnot and i think PRON know the big thing for PRON be just try to let people know PRON know PRON mom be a teacher that there be difference PRON know and i think in order for PRON to change where PRON be mentally as a country PRON have to be inform PRON have to be educate so that be a lot of PRON need to be about public school and fund public school the person who the president the current president put into head the department of education have be try to privatize school PRON kid mostly go to public school joe biden be say triple the funding for public school in the low income community right election matter election matter when PRON think about the fact that PRON need to have a president and leadership in the white house that know if a black child have a black teacher music by the end of third grade PRON be more likely to go to college if PRON have two black teacher before the end of third grade PRON be double that number likely to go to college and i be live proof of that thank god for mrs francis wilson may PRON rest in peace who be PRON first grade teacher and attend PRON law school graduation right so these be some of the example of the fact that election matter because who hold those position will make such important decision about PRON life i agree wholeheartedly and i think one of the reason why PRON be here be to have those type of conversation to drive education to the masse because a lot of time people do not feel like PRON can create change and i think in the bubble tobia PRON talk about PRON have actionable item in which PRON can drive change and figure out what be near and dear to PRON heart for PRON PRON be education reform for PRON i know PRON have care a lot about not only education but police brutality can PRON speak on kind of what PRON go through mentally in the bubble see some of the thing happen to PRON black and brown brother and sister and just maybe kind of pose a question in which PRON can try to figure out way collectively to help inspire change yeah so PRON know for PRON in the bubble with everything go on with PRON try to really bring attention to the brianna taylor case and then to get the result that PRON do be PRON make up PRON make PRON personally feel like man like PRON be bring all this type of attention and PRON get a PRON get a bad result and PRON PRON have have bad result with police brutality in the past also so like one thing i would want to know what be way what be way that PRON may be different or what be way PRON may handle PRON differently than the PRON president now have handle PRON because PRON just do not a lot of PRON do not sit well with PRON family member and i know that the african american community who truly care and know that that could be PRON brother or sister next PRON know hi PRON name be tobias harris PRON be from long island new york and i play for the philadelphia ers and today PRON be talk to senator harris as a young african american PRON do not truly understand and get the true knowledge of PRON history and i know personally i do not get the true knowledge of PRON history in elementary middle and high school now PRON learn what the curriculum want PRON to learn so those be always thing that for PRON personally that i will make sure PRON future kid will understand understand PRON heritage PRON where PRON come from who PRON be and i think PRON know as be a quote unquote star athlete throughout high school PRON know PRON be like a pass for a lot of thing um when i would be out PRON be not like oh that be a six eight black kid like oh that be tobias harris PRON know so those type of thing not to say that PRON be PRON be like bad for PRON personally but PRON be kind of like PRON be sugar coat for PRON well the old i get i be like man i have experience but PRON experience be not PRON know be not what someone else experience be and i think that PRON have to learn from that have the sympathy for other experience that be in those in that walk the same journey as PRON just just a different path there be not a black man i know be PRON a relative or a friend who have not have some experience with police which have be about an unreasonable stop some kind of profiling or excessive force so PRON start with have leadership that speak the truth about the fact of PRON PRON do not have that in the white house right now right PRON be PRON be basically try to say that people who be protest be looter and PRON be violent and talk about law and order not understand peaceful protest be part of how this nation be found music PRON be how this nation be found peaceful protest be what allow PRON to be the only the second black woman ever elect to the united states senate and allow PRON to be here right have the right that PRON do but there be still a lot of work to be do but PRON matter who be in a position of leadership and and how PRON use the mic that be in front of PRON and part of this on the issue of police brutality be about speak the truth of PRON so these be the kind of thing that PRON have to put in place but PRON have to start with speak truth and do PRON in a way that understand and accept that PRON know as i say and i say PRON last night bad cop be bad for good cop PRON need to deal with PRON and there need to be consequence because see the thing that i know be that in the criminal justice system there be this this phrase that be often use and the phrase be consequence and accountability there need to be consequence and accountability PRON be this phrase be use all the time and almost every time PRON be use PRON be direct at the person who be arrest and not at the system PRON and the player in the system and that be the problem there need to be consequence and accountability on behalf of the system PRON and the player in the system african american black people that voter PRON be important because there be a period of time where PRON do not have the right to vote right and that um PRON have PRON ancestor walk in numerous amount of mile to go vote and PRON have this opportunity to vote and be able to express um PRON opinion on PRON political view and PRON view of what PRON want to see the world get to so i think voting be important i think that with for the one that do not want the lord i think PRON ancestor be like roll around like be PRON serious like PRON PRON fight like PRON have have civil leader down all the way down line fight for PRON be still fight for equality in many different area but voting be one of the thing that push PRON to to continue this movement but what PRON guy be do in term of the activism and the and the leadership and and the organizing and the bully pulpit that PRON each have PRON be so powerful PRON be so powerful and the thing be be that what PRON guy have be do be PRON be PRON be everything about the expression but PRON be also about then help people figure out where to go with PRON and what to demand to PRON point right these be the thing to ask for these be the thing to demand look at where PRON be at currently in society with covet PRON have to sit here six foot away yell at each other with mask on PRON be impact everything look at the current administration and PRON lack of belief in science as a as a person who be big on education and have family that work in health care PRON future wife be a dentist PRON father a dentist i think this this conversation can kind of tie in covet PRON can tie in healthcare PRON can tie in education and donovan PRON grow up in a household in which PRON mother be a teacher how have covid PRON know kind of affect the educational system and then PRON can kind of tie in hbcus and what that mean for PRON future leader who be try to learn via zoom yeah um so PRON mom hey sorry to say PRON mom be an aka PRON PRON love PRON uh PRON be back here somewhere excited and PRON know the good thing about PRON as a person be the fact that i finally at year old understand that the ball stop at some point and the only thing i will have in life be what be up here take a while but PRON mom instill that in PRON PRON be be PRON be be a teacher PRON just retire and that be really what allow PRON to use PRON voice in the bubble PRON know and allow PRON to really feel comfortable with PRON PRON know i go to private school music and public school so PRON have see the two different america in this world and PRON be crazy as a kid PRON put on a different persona when PRON be in private school than when PRON be play basketball in new york city PRON know and as a kid that be just that be life i do not know what PRON be until i get old and start realize that there be some friend that go to private school with that have no idea what be happen minute away in the project in certain area no idea how people live yeah and vice versa that be right so for PRON understand and have PRON mom and talk to PRON about PRON i be just like how can PRON continue to find way to to push education educate black white hispanics asians on each other history yeah PRON know because PRON be PRON be and there be people who be way old than PRON that do not even know what juneteenth be i know or black wall street i know and PRON be inform PRON and i always wonder PRON know if PRON want to get to the ultimate goal of equality PRON know whether PRON be through education or systemic racism or voter suppression whatever PRON be the good thing PRON can do be inform and if PRON want to make that decision to choose that then that be PRON decision but at least PRON be educate on PRON if i be to talk to PRON young generation PRON know i say like PRON be not young PRON but PRON be on why voting matter i think the big thing be understand PRON be not just vote for the president of the united states PRON know PRON be vote locally if PRON would like to see thing change locally in PRON particular state then PRON vote count PRON vote count regardless of what PRON be but PRON vote and be able to to leave PRON stamp on something and leave PRON imprint on PRON i think be something that PRON really need to take pride in education educate PRON on why voting matter understand that if PRON want for PRON police brutality be huge for PRON understanding bang the chokehold PRON know knee restraint understand that that need to be ban i think those be certain thing that whatever PRON feel be important to PRON understand why PRON be good or be not good who PRON should and should not vote for um understand that that happen locally whether PRON be the governor PRON be the mayor PRON know those be the people that make up the police department the fire department make up all these people that PRON see on a daily basis in PRON community so understand that how PRON vote PRON one vote plus another person vote plus another visibility over over to people can change an entire election which can change what happen in PRON community so understanding that PRON have the power to change that PRON need to continue as a people to understand that without PRON vote PRON know nothing change PRON know young black and brown kid code PRON right yes a lot of kid do not understand the importance of code and how necessary PRON be yes across the world and there be over a half million job that be readily available and PRON only need two year of experience at code before PRON could be make to that be right so PRON have really focused on that i think PRON have do a great job of touch on actionable item in which PRON can do collectively in which some of PRON listener and viewer can do i think tobias have a question in term of PRON know how PRON can remake america obviously with with senator harris PRON with vp biden uh PRON be on board and PRON be look forward to help solicit change through voting but i think what PRON want to know collectively especially tobia be what do remake america look like with PRON ticket yeah i say look PRON go to any upper middle class suburb in america PRON will not see the kind of police presence that PRON will see in other community but what PRON will see well fund public school high rate of home ownership access to capital for small business affordable health care and affordable mental health care right people who have job that allow PRON to get to the end of the month and not worry about can PRON feed PRON child healthy community be safe community so part of how joe and i think about PRON be PRON get to invest in the health of all community and but PRON do PRON in a way that be about not only equality but equity so there be a big difference between equality and equity equality suggest oh everyone should get the same amount the problem with that not everybody be start out from the same place so if PRON be all get the same amount but PRON start up back there and i start out over here PRON could get the same amount but PRON be still go to be that far back behind PRON equity equitable treatment mean PRON all end up at the same place i appreciate PRON not only come here but but share so much on impactful way PRON can all drive change PRON have all try to use PRON voice collectively different way as african american man PRON feel like PRON have a responsibility yeah PRON know PRON PRON grow up in in certain household where PRON be privilege enough uh to have both parent around in PRON life to push PRON and allow PRON to get the education PRON deserve and a lot of americans do not necessarily have that that choice or that voice so PRON want to speak out on behalf of PRON i would encourage PRON know people to go out and vote personally PRON be from canton ohio i live in oregon now i know PRON have get a lot of east coast guy here as well but i just want to encourage people to to continue to go out and vote i think that be big and i know PRON be go to be pretty short on time but if there be anything else PRON guy want to ask ask now or forever hold PRON piece until the next time just want to say thank PRON and um look forward to um see the change i think that be that be why PRON be here that be what PRON that be why that be why PRON be here look forward to be a part of the change and part of history so thank PRON and um look forward to PRON and PRON be look forward to PRON and personally there be a lot of stuff i do in education but as PRON have share i know there be a lot of way in which PRON could probably collaborate and work on thing together continue to improve society so PRON be look forward to PRON and PRON will continue to talk and and collectively brainstorm actionable idea but once again i want to encourage everyone to attend iwillvote com once again iwillvote com that be extremely important the election be come soon and PRON have a chance to to help drive and make real change so thankful for PRON conversation today with so many special guest really really look forward to continue to figure out way to bring about change actionable change do not forget the most powerful tool PRON have at hand be the right to vote please visit www i and continue to try to bring about music music change music PRON

i'm also very excited to welcome here at this historically black college my alpha kappa alpha or kamala harris we are here in atlanta georgia the heart of this state's democratic base the city we are standing in is steeped in history it's filled with the bravery and persistence of so many who have came before us their legacy is what's carried us to this moment on the very cuffs of making history this is the most consequential election in recent history and georgia will play a pivotal role in it georgia will help determine the future of our nation as it has so many times in the past in fact history has already been made this year in georgia over 2 million georgia voters have already cast their ballots in this election so far give it up that is a 133 inc increase from this time in 2016. more absentee ballots have been submitted so far in this election than were submitted in the entire 2016 election right here in georgia there are 800 000 newly registered voters in our state since 2018 49 of which are new voters and people of color and 46 are under the age of 30. additionally yeah give it up additionally nearly a quarter of early voters in georgia did not even vote in the 2016 election at least a quarter of them have early voted and we still have 11 days to go i am so energized with the enthusiasm of each and every one of you and what we're seeing in georgia from georgia voters we are fired up and we are not letting go we are going to reach every single georgia voter between now and november 3rd we will leave no stone unturned and no voter ignored georgians are voting because georgians are hurting they know we need a change in leadership they know that we cannot afford another four more years of this administration it's never been more clear that we need leaders who are actually interested in leading and those leaders are joe biden and kamala harris the unprecedented times that we are experiencing as a nation and as a state have been exacerbated by a white house that doesn't know how to or doesn't want to properly deal with challenges which is why those challenges have now become crisis and we are facing multiple crises the global health pandemic economic downturn systematic racism and climate crisis our current administration ignores all of these and has no plans to address them they aren't fighting for working families here in georgia and across the country they're only looking out for their buddies and special interests and they have no plans no plans to contain covet 19 which has killed 7 700 of our fellow georgians and have left tens of thousands more out of work joe and kamala have concrete plans to tackle covet 19 to build our economy back better and to root out systematic racism biden's vision for america is rooted in inclusivity and equality and his comprehensive approach to building back better will address the inequities that persist in our society these investments are going to uplift and stabilize our communities by making sure all americans have access to a high quality education good paying jobs and affordable health care our current administration has put politics and special interests before the american people time and time again and it's time for a change and that change is joe biden and kamala harris but it's going to be up to each and every one of us to exercise our right to vote in order to make that change we need to mobilize our families friends and neighbors like we have never done before there is simply too much at stake to sit this one out in 11 days we will elect joe biden and kamala harris we will restore decency and leadership to the white house and we will restore the soul of our nation thank you so much and i am pleased to introduce state representative karen bennett to the stage how's everybody doing i thought i was going to come up here on some music but are you ready are you ready georgia it has never been more clear first of all let me thank my sorrow and representative state representative darshan kendrick a great aka sister that's right how many of you know it's never been more clear than today that we need leaders like joe biden and my aka sister kamala harris in the white house yes they will serve the american people with honor and will not make a spectacle of the oval office you see president trump has focused on downplaying the virus instead of getting the virus under control so meanwhile thanks to trump's ineptitude our economy is in peril small businesses have been suffering and many are not getting the help that they need to recover georgia's georgians are hurting now more than ever before and we need leaders in the white house who will listen to the experts and serve the people and not their own interests so throughout her career kamala harris has proven i said she has proven that she is strong a decisive leader who has what it takes to lift our country up and put us back on the right track is that right georgians she is willing to roll up her sleeves and start doing the work on day one to root out corruption that has flourished under this trump administration and she and joe biden will ignite the changes we need to protect working families and give them the tools to thrive so georgia's judges have been lining up to vote early filling out absentee ballots and they're dropping them off even as we speak so georgia it's my delight to bring up another sister the chairman of the democrat georgia democratic party the democratic party of georgia and the next congresswoman of district 5 senator nakima williams we're gonna keep y'all safe today y'all hello hello hello i am state senator nakima williams and i have the privilege of being the chairwoman of the democratic party of georgia i'm excited to be here with y'all today and i want to give a special shout out to all of the hard-working people across the state of georgia because y'all we're a battleground state and we are here because of you georgia voters are ready to take us to victory we know the power of our voices because we've seen the growth of our movement over just four short years we've seen how scared has made the other side and we're ready to make good trouble like congressman john lewis taught us we're ready to stand up for our values because y'all we can't afford to wait for the progress that our communities need and we're ready to knock on every door turn out every voter for joe biden and my soror kamala harris but y'all we're not going to stop there we're going to elect democrats up and down the ballot because we know for sure that the road to a senate majority and the white house is paved right through georgia we're 11 days y'all 11 days from the most consequential election of our lifetime and y'all we're ready for this fight for the last four years we've mobilized we've organized and we've met this extraordinary time with resilience dignity and faith and with just 11 days left of this election more than 2.3 million early votes have already been cast in georgia but we're not done for the next 40 day next 11 days we're not going to falter we won't lose focus we're going to vote early we're going to vote this weekend we're going to vote saturday and sunday in force we're going to make sure that our friends and family vote this weekend and we're going to keep hustling every day for the next 11 days until we've made sure that every single georgia voter turns out to vote and we turn the state a deep shade of blue yeah we gotta keep this fight going all the way through november 3rd until we finish the job and elect joe biden and kamala harris and democrats up and down the ballot everything is on the line everything is on the ballot and this team is going to get it done georgia democrats are ready to live our values out loud and on purpose for the promise of america this is battleground georgia and we're gonna win y'all thank you hello georgia i can't hear you hello everybody well listen welcome to the campus of morehouse college my alma mater and um i'm always grateful to welcome a great bison woman to the canvas campus of morehouse ain't you in the house i'm reverend rafael warnock senior pastor of ebenezer baptist church and a candidate for the united states senate in the great state of georgia i'm running in the special election against kelly lefler it's all right she's warming up the seat until i get there but i want to thank senator harris for coming down to georgia and we say to her welcome to the battleground state let me start there no one in georgia believes that this is a red state any longer even the other side does not believe that this is a red state that's why they're engaged in voter suppression but we're going to overcome their voter suppression with voter enthusiasm and voter passion are you ready to flip georgia blue are you ready to take back the senate for democrats so that we can vote on the john lewis voting rights act and so much good legislation that needs to pass and so make no mistake we are building a mighty movement even now we are seeing a great outpouring of voters we've already seen one million more voters at this point in the cycle than we did in 2016. and so if we keep up this enthusiasm if we keep up this movement there is no doubt that we are on our way to record voter turnout and we need it because the stakes could not be higher in this election when we go to the polls we'll see the names of those running for office on the ballot but we know that citizens do not vote for politicians citizens vote for themselves and so let's be very clear about what's on the ballot health care is on the ballot the dignity of workers is on the ballot the future of our planet is on the ballot and so we've got to win back the white house but not only that we've got to take back these two united states senate seats are you ready to do it and so i'm proud to be running for the united states senate in a state where i grew up a pastor of ebenezer church in atlanta but i was born in savannah georgia i'm a georgia boy my mother's from waycross you all know where that is it's way across georgia my dad was born in burke county and then squibbing county and then chatham county i'm a georgia boy i grew up in public housing one of 12 children in my family i'm number 11 and the first college graduate in my family i arrived on this campus i won't say how many years ago as a freshman i came on a full faith scholarship that means i didn't have enough money for the first semester but with faith in god and faith in myself i earned my degree i went on to get two other master's degrees and a phd degree through hard work a sense of personal responsibility grit and determination but that alone didn't do it somebody gave me a pell grant somebody gave me a low interest student loan in other words somebody provided for me a ladder of opportunity and so i'm running for the united states senate because i see that there are those who get to the top and then they kick down the ladder so that other folk can't climb up and so we've got to reclaim the white house we've got to flip the senate blue and we've got to redeem the soul of america the stakes are so high we've got to win the future for all of our children are you ready to do it well let's get this job done now my team would want me to tell you that when you go to vote in the special election for senate make sure you look all the way down because my name is one of 21 names on the ballot and i'm the name next to the last name on the ballot but i'm a preacher and somewhere i read in scripture that the last shall be first yeah let the car say amen let's win this thing for georgia it is my distinct honor to welcome my brother from another mother you got a the pastor of ebenezer church and a young jewish guy both running for the senate would you welcome an amazing american john also the next united states senator hello morehouse hello atlanta hey everybody you hear me in the back you can lay on the horn now all right it is truly an honor to follow my friend reverend warnock who in the u.s senate will be a great voice of moral clarity for our state and for our country georgia we have the chance right now to elect two new united states senators but to do that we've got to vote like we've never voted before and that doesn't mean waiting until november third that's just the last chance to vote we need to vote now and listen for everybody out there and watching at home tomorrow in georgia we have statewide early voting in every county so we need to make a plan to vote early to vote tomorrow to get out our friends and our family and our colleagues and people from church to vote like never before because there's too much on the line to sit this out not just the chance to elect two new united states senators to represent georgia but the opportunity and the obligation to end this trump presidency and to elect kamala harris and joe biden to lead this country forward we can't take another four years of donald trump y'all america deserves better we need ethical leaders who put the people's interests ahead of their own who put our health ahead of their donors who bring us together instead of turning us against one another my mother came to this country as an immigrant when she was 23 years old because she believed this was a country that welcomed those striving for opportunity or fleeing persecution that we are out of many one that we're on a journey of progress toward fully realizing our founding ideals an america with true equal justice and equal protection under the law and a government for of and by the people so our obligation this year is to vote is to get everybody we know to vote to elect brilliant leaders like joe biden and kamala harris to turn the chapter on this dark chapter in our history we need a change i'm grateful to you i love you i wish you good health thank you so much [Music] uh [Music] hello georgia hello morehouse college we're so grateful to be with you here today my name is lucy mcbath and i am the congresswoman for georgia's 6th congressional district and i am so honored to help welcome the next vice president of the united states senator kamala harris to georgia you know we're gathered here today in times more uncertain than in any in recent history and memory this pandemic has caused grief for many economic hardship for millions and it has altered the day-to-day lives of every single american our country is crying out for strong sensible leadership in washington and when we win the white house in november it will actually have begun here in georgia georgia has already seen record-breaking numbers of people cast their ballots this election and that momentum is only growing hard-working families across georgia understand that this election may be the most important of our lifetimes and the choices have never been clearer this election is between those who seek to divide and those who wish to unite it is between those who see who sow the seeds of hatred and those who are rooted in the fight for peace and justice and prosperity now more than ever we need leaders who will fight for a future where love and compassion drive out hate and violence a future with faith and hope for a brighter world a future that we can all believe in a future that we can all live in senator harris and vice president biden are the leaders who can and will bring us into this future when i ran for office in 2018 much of the country had written off my campaign and i never dreamed that i would be running for congress like most americans i just wanted to start a family and raise a compassionate and caring and loving child then eight years ago i lost my son jordan davis and an unnecessary and tragic racially motivated hate filled murder jordan was only 17 years old and as i put the pieces of my life back together i began speaking out after the tragedy in parkland florida i stood up to run for office taking on an nra backed incumbent in a seat which had not been blue since 1979 to fight for the safety of our families and that is what is on the line this november no family in this country should ever have to go through what i did and when i ran for office the pundits thought my seat could never be won by just a regular mom like myself but those who know me know that nothing is more important and more powerful than a mom or a woman like kamala harris on a mission [Music] and so we got to work as many of you are doing here you are texting you're calling you're knocking on doors but most importantly we are voting and we are voting early because of the work of the tireless dedicated volunteers many of you right here we flipped my seat and we are flipping seats all over georgia and that's exactly what we're going to do this november for kamala harris and joe biden we're going to win from the very top of the ticket to the very bottom we're going to elect john ossoff and rafael warnock we're going to vote for leaders like representative kendrick and representative bennett and we will win this state so this evening as i speak to every one of you my fellow georgians it is time for us to make our voices heard not just for our state but for the entire country truth compassion and respect are on the ballot it is our time to speak out loudly for steady leadership that can guide us it is time to vote for compassionate leaders who understand the sacrifices hard-working families have made at the kitchen table and it is our time to elect for the first time in this nation's history a black woman as vice president of the united states of america this year in this historic election may we honor the legacy of those whose shoulders we now stand on legacies like that of my friend and colleague the late john lewis whose service and sacrifice opened the doors of opportunity for americans of every color and every creed and may we remember his words as we fight for the soul of this nation we have a moral obligation a mission and a mandate to do what we can to make our country and our world a better place and to help usher in a loving community where no one is left out or left behind our strength as a nation has always been our ability to come together to address our greatest challenges and that is the opportunity that we have in this moment when we look back at this election in years to come i pray that every one of us will take pride in our response to the challenges that we now face that we fought to protect our fellow americans our brothers and our sisters of this great nation with care and with compassion with love unity and unshakeable determination that we elected joe biden and kamala harris as the next president and vice president of the united states of america and the power is now in our hands and now i am happy to introduce to you mr rick hart a student at morehouse college and he is a co-chair of the young leaders for biden thank you so much congresswoman mcbath and good afternoon atlanta my name is rick hart and i'm a junior political science major

to you the next vice president of these united states of america senator kamala harris [Music] thank you [Music] [Applause] [Music] oh [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] what's up atlanta i'm so happy to be back in the atl hey everybody can we here for rick hart where is he where'd he go what's up rick he was so good he's so good he's the um he's the head of the georgia there you are you just tore it up rick is the head of the georgia students for biden the co-chair and i'll tell you one of the things that i love about joe biden you know and he says it often he understands his long life of service and dedication to public service but he is always uplifting those who are the emerging leaders and rick hart is one of them so can we give it up for rick because that's what it's all about that's what it's all about it's about everybody taking on their role of leadership knowing that we have so much at stake in this election there is so much at stake and so i came back to atlanta i love atlanta last time i was here i actually it was before the pandemic i spoke on the stage here at morehouse in march of last year and you know coming to indiana especially if you are black and hold elected office in america coming to atlanta is like coming back to the womb it really is it is because atlanta represents so much about who we are as america atlanta represents the hopes and the dreams and the fight to make real the promise of america atlanta is a place that has produced leaders who have been national leaders and international leaders who have always understood that hope will fuel the fight faith will be what grounds us in knowing what is possible but then you gotta just organize the folks and bring people together and recognize that nothing we have ever achieved as a nation by way of progress came without a fight and so that's what we have in front of us we have for the next 11 days georgia a fight for the soul of our nation this is a fight that we are engaged in because we believe in the ideals of our country we believe in our democracy we know that america's democracy will always be as strong as we the people are in our willingness to fight for those ideals and so that's where we are today in a fight for the ideals and a fight for the dignity in a fight for justice and equal justice under law and let's look at what is at stake so we're dealing with a pandemic and we're dealing with partly because of that four crises that are occurring at one time in our nation we're looking at because of the pandemic a public health crisis where we have seen 220 over 220 000 americans lose their lives in just the last several months many of whom tragically in their last days on earth couldn't even be with their family with people they love because of the nature of this pandemic we're looking at over eight and a half million folks who have contracted the virus thankfully have lived but are looking at untold long-term consequences doctors are talking about things like lung scarring and in the midst of this public health pandemic we have a donald trump who thanks to bob woodward we know knew back on january 28th he knew the deal about kovit he had been informed that it can kill people that it is five times as likely to kill as the flu he knew it was airborne he knew it could harm children and he sat on that information and he did not tell the american people can you imagine what you might have done had you known what he knew on january 28th how folks might have prepared how folks might have said you know i got to buy some extra toilet paper at the very least but also how the fact is that even in donald trump's america before the pandemic folks were working two and three jobs to try and pay the bills and pay the rent joe biden i believe in our america nobody should have to work more than one job to pay their bills and pay the rent and put food on the table and he sat on this information and then had the gall had the nerve to say it was a hoax to muzzle the public health experts to suggest that he keeps a ledger and you're on one side of his ledger if you don't wear a mask you're on the other side of his ledger if you wear a mask and now where we are now look where we are and he's in the united states supreme court with his boy bill barr trying to sue to get rid of the affordable care act and let's step back from a moment and think about this this man from the time he was even before he was running for office when he questioned the legitimacy of the birthplace of the first black president of the united states has been so weirdly obsessed with trying to get rid of whatever barack obama created think about that we don't need presidents who have weird obsessions [Music] what is that about so he's in court right now trying to get rid of the affordable care act which brought health coverage to over 20 million americans cover people with pre-existing conditions you know anybody who has diabetes high blood pressure breast cancer lupus and he wants to get rid of the thing that brought care and dignity to tens of millions of americans this is one of the reasons donald trump got to go got to go we are in the middle of all these crises the economic crisis over 30 million people in just the last several months had to file for unemployment we are looking at families that are getting up at the crack of dawn to drive to sit in their car in a food line for hours praying that they can get to the end of the line before the food runs out one in five mothers in america is describing her children under the age of 12 as being hungry we're in the midst of a hunger crisis in america and you see again on the one hand you have joe biden who says let me tell you how i measure the economy and how well it is doing i measure the greatness of the economy based on how working people are doing how are working people doing when working people and working families are doing well then the economy is doing well which is why joe biden and i are saying one taxes will not be raised on anyone making less than four hundred thousand dollars a year we are saying that we know one of the greatest ways that we achieve access to economic health and intergenerational prosperity is home ownership so we will have a 15 000 tax credit for first-time home buyers to help you with down payments and closing costs to buy a home we understand working families need child care but nobody should have to pay more than seven percent of their income in child care that is our commitment because we know the economy is doing well when working people are doing well on the other hand you have donald trump who measures how well the economy is doing based on the stock market who measures how well the economy is doing based on how rich people are doing who as one of his first orders of business passed a tax bill benefiting the top 1 percent and the biggest corporations of america i will tell you joe biden and i will make it one of our highest priorities to get rid of that tax bill and do what we know needs to be done to invest that money in working families public health crisis and economic crisis being compared to the great depression a long overdue reckoning on racial injustice in america so on the one hand you have joe biden who has the knowledge and the courage enough to use the term and speak those words black lives matter on the other hand you have donald trump who refuses and will never say black lives matter and then have the gall to stand on that debate stage at the last debate in front of 70 million americans and would not condemn white supremacists and you know people have asked me they say well senator harris by the way senator's not on my birth certificate it's kamala um and they say well do you think are you saying do do you think he's a racist yes yes because you see it's not like it's some random one-off we've seen that pattern going back to him questioning the legitimacy of barack obama going back to charlottesville when people were peacefully protesting racial injustice in america a woman was killed and on the other side you had a bunch of neo-nazis wearing swastikas carrying tiki torches slurring and he's throwing out anti-semitic and racist slurs and donald trump said well there are fine people on both sides a president of the united states who referred to mexicans as rapists and criminals a president of the united states who made it as one of his first policy initiatives a ban on muslims entering our country and then stood on that stage and would not condemn known white supremacists and then doubled down and said well they should stand back and stand by this is not reflective of who we believe we are as a nation we need a president who acknowledges systemic racism who acknowledges the history of america and uses that bully pulpit and that microphone in a way that speaks truth with an intention to address the inequities and bring our country together and that is joe biden four crises public health economic a grappling and a need to deal with racial injustice and a climate crisis so you know i come from california i was born in oakland california and um we have we have some california you know okay the west coast has been burning because of those wildfires california oregon washington the gulf states have been battered by these storms people in the midwest farmers have lost a whole season of crops because of the floods so joe biden says we need to embrace science we need to deal with it this is something that is hurting people it is something that we can address in a way we also create jobs by investing in infrastructure investing and building renewable energy that's going to be about jobs joe biden knows the seriousness of of environmental justice issues he knows that of all of the areas where people live in america with poor air quality 70 percent of the people in those areas are people of color joe biden knows what's going on at flint joe biden says we need to address this and we need to pay attention to science on the other hand you have donald trump who recently when he was asked about the wildfires in california and the reporter said something like well you know so the scientists are basically saying these fires you know what's happening um the scientists are saying there's a connection between this drastic changes in the climate and these wildfires you know what the president united states said in response science doesn't know what science doesn't know the president of the united states and what we see is the through line right on that issue in the first issue an inability to embrace fact and inability to embrace experts an inability to embrace intelligence and inability to be competent and inability to do the job of commander in chief of the united states whose first responsibility is to concern themselves with the health and safety of the american people and that's why we're going to like joe biden [Music] there is so much at stake now you all know in atlanta helped me when i ran for senate and i am now the only black woman in the united states senate only the second in america's history to be elected to the united states senate and i'm going to tell you because i've been there now for almost four years the senate is so important on all these issues like we we need to take back the white house there's no question about that we also need to take back the senate we need to take back the senate you know it's the senators that will make decisions about advise and consent on who sits in the united states supreme court right one of the reasons i became a lawyer is because i was inspired by thurgood marshall and and charles hamilton houston and constance baker motley right um they are the ones who fought for brown v board of education they are the ones who have fought for civil rights who sits in the united states supreme court has everything to do with our fight for equality well it's going to be the president who who nominates somebody but it's the senate who advise and consent will make the decision about whether it goes through and right now we're seeing that battle in full relief with this illegitimate process they've engaged in to try and fill the seat of the great ruth bader ginsburg while people are voting in an election the majority of american people say let us decide who will be our president and then let that person decide who fills that seat the united states senate the united states senate is where there will be a decision on whether we put on the floor a bill that my brother cory booker from new jersey and i wrote called the george floyd justice and policing act a bill that says like joe biden and i say we should ban chokeholds and carotid holes because george floyd would be alive today if that were the case a bill that says let's have a national registry of police officers who break the law because that is the right thing to do and we can't have folks just get fired one place and then they'll get hired somewhere else it says we need to have a national standard for excessive use of force because it's not right that in some places when there is excessive use of force the question asked is was it reasonable when we all know you can reason away just about anything and the more fair and just question to ask is was it necessary we need to change the standard those kinds of decisions yes they get made from the white house and we will make them it also gets made in the senate and so that brings me to raphael warnock and john assaf and georgia you've got to send them to the united states senate send them to the united states senate let them represent georgia on all these issues it is critically important and you know those those senate seats those are six year terms think about your plans for your life and for your children's life over the course of the next six years there's a lot that can get done either for good or for not these senate seats are so important so i'm here atlanta georgia to ask you to do what i know you already know how to do so well which is to organize which is to to talk to folks about what's at stake which is to remind people on the issue of voting that we've got so many reasons one has to do with again atlanta it has to do with john lewis it has to do with those men and women who shed blood on that edmund pettus bridge and so many other places for our right to vote and so voting is about honoring those ancestors honoring what they fought for and what they sacrificed for our right to vote voting is because there is so much at stake everything that we discussed everything that affects our lives and voting also is because we're not going to let anyone mess with our right to vote because hero here's how i think about that step back and think about you know and i've been i i've been spending a lot of time all over i've been in florida this week i was in north carolina this week um i'll be in ohio tomorrow but think about it from this perspective ever since and even before they gutted the voting rights act in 2013 a whole lot of really powerful people including in this state because otherwise we would be talking about governor stacy a whole lot of powerful people for quite some time have been trying to suppress our vote have been trying to purge the voter rolls have been trying to confuse us about the process to make it difficult oh you can fill out your ballot and then put it in one envelope but then you need to put it in another envelope and make sure that's signed trying to confuse us trying to make it difficult messing with the post office can you imagine the post office like the postman the post woman they're messing with the post office and we have to at some point sit back and think why are they trying to make it so difficult and confusing for us to vote and i think the answer is because they know our power they know our power they know when we vote things change they know when we vote we win [Music] and so i'm here to say atlanta let's not let anybody take our power from us we know the power of our voice we know at election time the power of our voice is expressed through our vote we're not gonna let anybody take us out this game we are present we are powerful we are active and we know what's at stake and we honor our ancestors every day and so my last point is this this moment will pass and years from now our children our grandchildren and others they will look in our eyes each one of us and they will ask us where were you at that time and the thing we're going to be able to tell them is so much more than just how we felt what we will tell them is what we did we will tell them there was this one particular afternoon we were hanging out at morehouse in the parking lot we will tell them we organize that we talk to our neighbors and our friends and our relatives we will tell them we help people get to the polls we will tell them on mandatory saturday which is tomorrow that we made sure everyone we know got to their county office to vote we will tell them we stood up and we fought for our country and we fought for the ideas because we love our country and we know our power thank you atlanta [Music] [Music] [Music] celebrating the things that everyone told me in my

with a pandemic and PRON be deal with partly because of that four crisis that be occur at one time in PRON nation PRON be look at because of the pandemic a public health crisis where PRON have see over americans lose PRON life in just the last several month many of whom tragically in PRON last day on earth could not even be with PRON family with people PRON love because of the nature of this pandemic PRON be look at over eight and a half million folk who have contract the virus thankfully have live but be look at untold long term consequence doctor be talk about thing like lung scarring and in the midst of this public health pandemic PRON have a donald trump who thank to bob woodward PRON know know back on january th PRON know the deal about kovit PRON have be inform that PRON can kill people that PRON be five time as likely to kill as the flu PRON know PRON be airborne PRON know PRON could harm child and PRON sit on that information and PRON do not tell the american people can PRON imagine what PRON may have do have PRON know what PRON know on january th how folk may have prepare how folk may have say PRON know i get to buy some extra toilet paper at the very least but also how the fact be that even in donald trump america before the pandemic folk be work two and three job to try and pay the bill and pay the rent joe biden i believe in PRON america nobody should have to work more than one job to pay PRON bill and pay the rent and put food on the table and PRON sit on this information and then have the gall have the nerve to say PRON be a hoax to muzzle the public health expert to suggest that PRON keep a ledger and PRON be on one side of PRON ledger if PRON do not wear a mask PRON be on the other side of PRON ledger if PRON wear a mask and now where PRON be now look where PRON be and PRON be in the united states supreme court with PRON boy bill barr try to sue to get rid of the affordable care act and let PRON step back from a moment and think about this this man from the time PRON be even before PRON be run for office when PRON question the legitimacy of the birthplace of the first black president of the united states have be so weirdly obsess with try to get rid of whatever barack obama create think about that PRON do not need president who have weird obsession music what be that about so PRON be in court right now try to get rid of the affordable care act which bring health coverage to over million americans cover people with pre existing condition PRON know anybody who have diabetes high blood pressure breast cancer lupus and PRON want to get rid of the thing that bring care and dignity to ten of million of americans this be one of the reason donald trump get to go get to go PRON be in the middle of all these crisis the economic crisis over million people in just the last several month have to file for unemployment PRON be look at family that be get up at the crack of dawn to drive to sit in PRON car in a food line for hour pray that PRON can get to the end of the line before the food run out one in five mother in america be describe PRON child under the age of as be hungry PRON be in the midst of a hunger crisis in america and PRON see again on the one hand PRON have joe biden who say let PRON tell PRON how i measure the economy and how well PRON be do i measure the greatness of the economy base on how work people be do how be work people do when work people and work family be do well then the economy be do well which be why joe biden and i be say one taxis will not be raise on anyone make less than four hundred thousand dollar a year PRON be say that PRON know one of the great way that PRON achieve access to economic health and intergenerational prosperity be home ownership so PRON will have a tax credit for first time home buyer to help PRON with down payment and closing cost to buy a home PRON understand work family need child care but nobody should have to pay more than seven percent of PRON income in child care that be PRON commitment because PRON know the economy be do well when work people be do well on the other hand PRON have donald trump who measure how well the economy be do base on the stock market who measure how well the economy be do base on how rich people be do who as one of PRON first order of business pass a tax bill benefit the top percent and the big corporation of america i will tell PRON joe biden and i will make PRON one of PRON high priority to get rid of that tax bill and do what PRON know need to be do to invest that money in work family public health crisis and economic crisis be compare to the great depression a long overdue reckon on racial injustice in america so on the one hand PRON have joe biden who have the knowledge and the courage enough to use the term and speak those word black life matter on the other hand PRON have donald trump who refuse and will never say black life matter and then have the gall to stand on that debate stage at the last debate in front of million americans and would not condemn white supremacist and PRON know people have ask PRON PRON say well senator harris by the way senator be not on PRON birth certificate PRON be kamala um and PRON say well do PRON think be PRON say do do PRON think PRON be a racist yes yes because PRON see PRON be not like PRON be some random one off PRON have see that pattern go back to PRON question the legitimacy of barack obama go back to charlottesville when people be peacefully protest racial injustice in america a woman be kill and on the other side PRON have a bunch of neo nazis wear swastikas carry tiki torch slur and PRON be throw out anti semitic and racist slur and donald trump say well there be fine people on both side a president of the united states who refer to mexicans as rapist and criminal a president of the united states who make PRON as one of PRON first policy initiative a ban on muslims enter PRON country and then stand on that stage and would not condemn know white supremacist and then double down and say well PRON should stand back and stand by this be not reflective of who PRON believe PRON be as a nation PRON need a president who acknowledge systemic racism who acknowledge the history of america and use that bully pulpit and that microphone in a way that speak truth with an intention to address the inequity and bring PRON country together and that be joe biden four crisis public health economic a grapple and a need to deal with racial injustice and a climate crisis so PRON know i come from california i be bear in oakland california and um PRON have PRON have some california PRON know okay the west coast have be burn because of those wildfire california oregon washington the gulf state have be batter by these storm people in the midwest farmer have lose a whole season of crop because of the flood so joe biden say PRON need to embrace science PRON need to deal with PRON this be something that be hurt people PRON be something that PRON can address in a way PRON also create job by invest in infrastructure investing and build renewable energy that be go to be about job joe biden know the seriousness of of environmental justice issue PRON know that of all of the area where people live in america with poor air quality percent of the people in those area be people of color joe biden know what be go on at flint joe biden say PRON need to address this and PRON need to pay attention to science on the other hand PRON have donald trump who recently when PRON be ask about the wildfire in california and the reporter say something like well PRON know so the scientist be basically say these fire PRON know what be happen um the scientist be say there be a connection between this drastic change in the climate and these wildfire PRON know what the president united states say in response science do not know what science do not know the president of the united states and what PRON see be the through line right on that issue in the first issue an inability to embrace fact and inability to embrace expert an inability to embrace intelligence and inability to be competent and inability to do the job of commander in chief of the united states whose first responsibility be to concern PRON with the health and safety of the american people and that be why PRON be go to like joe biden music there be so much at stake now PRON all know in atlanta help PRON when i run for senate and i be now the only black woman in the united states senate only the second in america history to be elect to the united states senate and PRON be go to tell PRON because PRON have be there now for almost four year the senate be so important on all these issue like PRON PRON need to take back the white house there be no question about that PRON also need to take back the senate PRON need to take back the senate PRON know PRON be the senator that will make decision about advise and consent on who sit in the united states supreme court right one of the reason i become a lawyer be because i be inspire by thurgood marshall and and charles hamilton houston and constance baker motley right um PRON be the one who fight for brown v board of education PRON be the one who have fight for civil right who sit in the united states supreme court have everything to do with PRON fight for equality well PRON be go to be the president who who nominate somebody but PRON be the senate who advise and consent will make the decision about whether PRON go through and right now PRON be see that battle in full relief with this illegitimate process PRON have engage in to try and fill the seat of the great ruth bader ginsburg while people be vote in an election the majority of american people say let PRON decide who will be PRON president and then let that person decide who fill that seat the united states senate the united states senate be where there will be a decision on whether PRON put on the floor a bill that PRON brother cory booker from new jersey and i write call the george floyd justice and police act a bill that say like joe biden and i say PRON should ban chokehold and carotid hole because george floyd would be alive today if that be the case a bill that say let PRON have a national registry of police officer who break the law because that be the right thing to do and PRON can not have folk just get fire one place and then PRON will get hire somewhere else PRON say PRON need to have a national standard for excessive use of force because PRON be not right that in some place when there be excessive use of force the question ask be be PRON reasonable when PRON all know PRON can reason away just about anything and the more fair and just question to ask be be PRON necessary PRON need to change the standard those kind of decision yes PRON get make from the white house and PRON will make PRON PRON also get make in the senate and so that bring PRON to raphael warnock and john assaf and georgia PRON have get to send PRON to the united states senate send PRON to the united states senate let PRON represent georgia on all these issue PRON be critically important and PRON know those those senate seat those be six year term think about PRON plan for PRON life and for PRON child life over the course of the next six year there be a lot that can get do either for good or for not these senate seat be so important so PRON be here atlanta georgia to ask PRON to do what i know PRON already know how to do so well which be to organize which be to to talk to folk about what be at stake which be to remind people on the issue of voting that PRON have get so many reason one have to do with again atlanta PRON have to do with john lewis PRON have to do with those man and woman who shed blood on that edmund pettus bridge and so many other place for PRON right to vote and so voting be about honor those ancestor honor what PRON fight for and what PRON sacrifice for PRON right to vote voting be because there be so much at stake everything that PRON discuss everything that affect PRON life and voting also be because PRON be not go to let anyone mess with PRON right to vote because hero here be how i think about that step back and think about PRON know and PRON have be i PRON have be spend a lot of time all over PRON have be in florida this week i be in north carolina this week um PRON will be in ohio tomorrow but think about PRON from this perspective ever since and even before PRON gutte the voting rights act in a whole lot of really powerful people include in this state because otherwise PRON would be talk about governor stacy a whole lot of powerful people for quite some time have be try to suppress PRON vote have be try to purge the voter roll have be try to confuse PRON about the process to make PRON difficult oh PRON can fill out PRON ballot and then put PRON in one envelope but then PRON need to put PRON in another envelope and make sure that be sign try to confuse PRON try to make PRON difficult messing with the post office can PRON imagine the post office like the postman the post woman PRON be mess with the post office and PRON have to at some point sit back and think why be PRON try to make PRON so difficult and confusing for PRON to vote and i think the answer be because PRON know PRON power PRON know PRON power PRON know when PRON vote thing change PRON know when PRON vote PRON win music and so PRON be here to say atlanta let PRON not let anybody take PRON power from PRON PRON know the power of PRON voice PRON know at election time the power of PRON voice be express through PRON vote PRON be not go to let anybody take PRON out this game PRON be present PRON be powerful PRON be active and PRON know what be at stake and PRON

music tell life music
157,coYK7KM4tIc,harris,2020-10-30T02:35:07Z,FULL RALLY | Kamala Harris and Bernie Sanders rally voters for Joe Biden,speech,"Oprah: TODAY ON ""SUPERSOUL SUNDAY,"" FORMER VICE PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN. YOU HAVE NO REGRET IN THE DEEPEST, QUIETEST, PUREST MOMENTS ABOUT NOT ACTUALLY RUNNING? HE'S SPEAKING FOR THE FIRST TIME ON TELEVISION ABOUT HIS HIGHLY-ANTICIPATED AND DEEPLY PERSONAL NEW BOOK, ""PROMISE ME, DAD: A YEAR OF HOPE, HARDSHIP, AND PURPOSE."" WHAT DID HAVING TO REVISIT ALL OF THE MAJOR MOMENTS IN YOUR LIFE TEACH YOU ABOUT WHERE YOU ARE NOW? REGARDED AS ONE OF THE MOST INFLUENTIAL VICE PRESIDENTS IN HISTORY, JOE BIDEN REFLECTS ON THIS TUMULTUOUS PERIOD OF AMERICAN POLITICS. A MONTH OUT, I CAME BACK AND SAID, ""WE'RE GOING TO LOSE THIS ELECTION."" HE SHARES HIS FAMILY'S SPIRITUAL AND EMOTIONAL JOURNEY AFTER THE HEARTBREAKING DEATH OF HIS SON, BEAU... WHAT HAPPENS IN THAT MOMENT WHEN YOU CAN LITERALLY SEE THE SPIRIT GOES SOMEPLACE? ...HIS RESILIENCE IN THE FACE OF PUBLIC SCRUTINY... WE WERE TAUGHT TO JUST TO GET UP. WHEN YOU GET KNOCKED DOWN, JUST GET UP. ...AND WHY THE DECISION NOT TO RUN FOR PRESIDENT STILL WEIGHS ON HIM. WAS I PREPARED TO BE ABLE TO GIVE MY WHOLE HEART, MY WHOLE SOUL, AND ALL MY ATTENTION TO THE ENDEAVOR? AND I KNEW I WASN'T. DO YOU FEEL THAT YOU COULD'VE BEATEN HILLARY? SO THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE, MR. VICE PRESIDENT. I'M HAPPY TO BE HERE. I KNOW COMING ALL THE WAY TO CALIFORNIA WAS... OH, I'M DELIGHTED TO BE HERE. IT'S ALWAYS A PLEASURE TO BE HERE. I WANTED TO START WITH THE MOMENT THAT WE ALL GOT TO SEE YOU EXPERIENCE ON CBS WHEN YOU DID THE LETTER TO YOURSELF. I FOUND THAT SO MOVING. LAST YEAR, YOU WROTE A LETTER TO YOUR YOUNGER SELF THAT STARTS WITH, ""DEAR JOE, YOUR STUTTER IS DEBILITATING. IT EMBARRASSES YOU, AND THE BULLIES ARE VICIOUS, BUT LISTEN TO MOM WHEN SHE SAYS BRAVERY RESIDES IN EVERY HEART, AND YOURS IS FIERCE AND CLEAR."" SHE DID SAY THAT. AHH. I JUST THOUGHT THAT'S NOT AN EASY FIRST SENTENCE, AND THE REST OF THE LETTER, AS IS YOUR NEW BOOK, JUST AS PERSONAL. SO WHAT DID COMING TO TERMS WITH WRITING THIS BOOK AND HAVING TO REVISIT ALL OF THE MAJOR MOMENTS IN YOUR LIFE TEACH YOU ABOUT WHERE YOU ARE NOW? WELL, YOU KNOW... MY MOTHER USED TO SAY, AND I THOUGHT IT WAS SO CRUEL AT ONE POINT, ESPECIALLY WHEN I LOST MY WIFE AND DAUGHTER, AND WE WALKED OUT OF THE HOSPITAL LATE. A TRACTOR TRAILER HAD BROADSIDED AND KILLED THEM, AND MY TWO SONS WERE BADLY INJURED, AND SHE SAID, ""JOEY,"" GRABBED MY HAND AND SHE SAID, ""OUT OF EVERYTHING HORRIBLE, SOMETHING GOOD WILL COME IF YOU LOOK HARD ENOUGH FOR IT,"" BUT THAT WAS MY MOTHER'S NOTION. WE WERE TAUGHT TO JUST TO GET UP. WHEN YOU GET KNOCKED DOWN, JUST GET UP AND MOVE FORWARD AND TALK ABOUT HOW SO MANY PEOPLE WITHOUT THE KIND OF HELP THAT I HAD DO IT EVERY DAY, RIGHT? RIGHT TODAY, THERE IS SOMEBODY WHO HAS GONE THROUGH SOMETHING THAT WAS SIGNIFICANTLY WORSE THAN ME, AND THEY HAVE NOBODY BEHIND THEM, AND THEY'RE GETTING UP, AND THEY'RE MOVING, AND IT GIVES ME SUCH OVERWHELMING CONFIDENCE IN PEOPLE, THE ABILITY TO ABSORB PAIN AND THE SPIRITUAL REASSURANCE THAT COMES FROM KNOWING THEY'RE STILL A PART OF YOU. WOULD YOU SAY THAT THAT IS ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT SPIRITUAL CHARACTERISTICS TO HAVE, THAT IS TO KEEP GETTING UP? ABSOLUTELY, ABSOLUTELY, BECAUSE YOU KNOW, IT'S -- I'M NOT SAYING IT'S EASY. I HAVE TO ADMIT TO YOU THERE HAVE BEEN A COUPLE TIMES IN MY -- WELL, ONE IN PARTICULAR IN MY LIFE WHERE I HAVE ACTUALLY LOST MY FAITH WHERE I WENT THROUGH A PERIOD OF THINKING, ""HOW COULD THIS BE?"" I MEAN, WHY, YOU KNOW, LIKE, THE ""WHY ME?"" PIECE. MM-HMM. MY DAD, WHO WAS A WONDERFUL, WELL-READ, GRACEFUL HIGH-SCHOOL-EDUCATED GUY, SAID, ""CHAMP, WHERE WAS IT WRITTEN THAT LIFE OWES YOU A LIVING, MAN?"" I KNOW, BUT IT DOESN'T MAKE YOU FEEL ANY BETTER IN THE MOMENT. WELL, WHAT IT MAKES... IT MAKES YOU, AT LEAST IN MY FAMILY... MY MOTHER THOUGHT THE GREATEST VIRTUE OF ALL WAS COURAGE AND BECAUSE IT ALLOWED ALL THE OTHER VIRTUES TO EXIST, AND FROM THE TIME I WAS A KID, NOT A JOKE, MY MOTHER WOULD GO, ""LOOK AT ME, JOEY."" MM-HMM. ""LOOK AT ME. REMEMBER, YOU'RE DEFINED BY YOUR COURAGE..."" WOW. ""...AND YOU'RE REDEEMED BY YOUR LOYALTY. LOOK AT ME, JOEY."" AND IT WAS THIS NOTION THAT YOU COULD DO ANYTHING BECAUSE THERE IS THIS NOTION IN MY FAITH, MY FAMILY, THAT THOSE YOU LOSE REMAIN A PART OF YOU. MM-HMM. BUT IT'S HARD TO GET THERE. IT'S HARD TO GET TO THE PLACE WHERE A MEMORY BRINGS A SMILE TO YOUR LIP BEFORE IT BRINGS A TEAR TO YOUR EYE. MM-HMM. I MEAN, IT'S A HARD THING TO GO THROUGH, BUT I WAS LUCKY. I ALWAYS HAD -- YOU'VE BEEN THROUGH IT A FEW TIMES. WELL, A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE BEEN THROUGH IT. YEAH. IN 1972, JUST WEEKS AFTER WINNING HIS FIRST RACE FOR SENATOR OF DELAWARE, VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN'S FIRST WIFE, NEILIA, AND HIS 13-MONTH-OLD DAUGHTER, NAOMI, WERE KILLED IN A CAR ACCIDENT. HIS SONS, HUNTER AND BEAU, WERE AGE 3 AND 4 AT THE TIME. THEY WERE INJURED BUT SURVIVED. IN 2015, BEAU BIDEN, A DECORATED WAR VETERAN AND DELAWARE'S ATTORNEY GENERAL, LOST HIS BATTLE WITH BRAIN CANCER. BEAU WAS 46 YEARS OLD. SO WHEN YOU GET THAT CALL, AND YOU'RE LIVING IN THAT SPACE OF DISBELIEF THAT THIS HAS ACTUALLY HAPPENED, AND YOU THINK THAT THIS IS THE WORST POSSIBLE THING THAT COULD EVER HAPPEN TO YOU, BUT YOU HAVE SOMEHOW BEEN TRAINED BY YOUR PARENTS, BY YOUR BELIEF SYSTEM, TO LOOK FOR THE OPPORTUNITY WITHIN EVERY TRAGEDY, BUT THAT DOESN'T COME EASY. NO, NO, IT DOESN'T. LOOK, I MEAN, I STILL... I STILL FIND MYSELF WHEN I TALK ABOUT MY BEAU, MY SON... YEAH. ...WHO DIED. AND I SOMETIMES FIND MYSELF SAY SOMETHING ABOUT IT, AND I CAN'T HANDLE IT. I START TO... I BREAK DOWN, SO IT'S NOT LIKE THE PAIN EVER GOES AWAY, BUT WHAT I DO IS I LOOK AT MY GRANDSON, HIS SON. MM-HMM. I SEE HIM. I LOOK AT MY GRANDDAUGHTER. I SEE HER, AND I KNOW HE'S STILL HERE. I KNOW HE'S STILL WITH ME. BUT WHEN YOU LOST NAOMI, YOUR BABY DAUGHTER, IN THE CAR ACCIDENT WITH YOUR FIRST WIFE -- NO PREPARATION, THE SHOCK OF IT, THE HORROR OF IT, IT'S QUITE DIFFERENT, ISN'T IT, WHEN YOU HAVE HAD SOME PREPARATION KNOWING THAT BEAU WAS SICK FOR A WHILE, OR IS IT? IT'S DIFFERENT, AND IT'S PROBABLY DIFFERENT FOR EVERY PERSON, BUT FOR ME, WHEN WHAT HAPPENED TO MY WIFE AND DAUGHTER HAPPENED, I HAD... I HAD A REASON TO LIVE. I HAD A REASON BY THESE TWO LITTLE BOYS WHO WERE IN THE HOSPITAL, AND, YOU KNOW, I SAID AT THE TIME -- I PROBABLY SHOULD'VE NEVER SAID IT ALL THOSE YEARS AGO. I SAID, ""I CAN UNDERSTAND HOW SOMEONE COULD BE COMPLETELY, THOROUGHLY SANE AND COMMIT SUICIDE AND DECIDE THAT, LOOK, I'VE BEEN TO THE TOP OF THE MOUNTAINS""... MM-HMM. ...""I'M NOT GETTING THERE AGAIN. I HAD IT ALL, AND THERE'S JUST, YOU KNOW""... MM-HMM. ...""SO LONG."" BUT I HAD THOSE TWO BOYS, AND IRONICALLY, THEY ENDED UP RAISING ME, OPRAH, NOT A JOKE. I MEAN, TO THIS DAY, MY SON, HUNTER, WHO IS PART OF MY SOUL, IF WE WALKED OFF OUT OF HERE AND HE SAID, ""HEY DAD, CAN I GET YOU ANYTHING,"" HE'D COME UP AND GIVE ME A KISS. HE'S 45 YEARS OLD, THE SMARTEST GUY I KNOW. HE'D GIVE ME A KISS. ""DAD, YOU NEED ANYTHING? YOU OKAY, DAD?"" CALLING ME, ASKING ME.    THEY LOST THEIR MOTHER. THEY LOST -- SO THERE WAS REINFORCEMENT. WATCHING SOMEONE WHO YOU ADORE, WHO REALLY IS PART OF YOUR SOUL, I MEAN, NOT -- IT'S NOT HYPERBOLE. WATCHING HIM GO THROUGH WITH SUCH GRACE BUT SUCH AWFUL PAIN, DYING, KNOWING THAT THE LIKELIHOOD THAT HE WAS GOING TO BE ABLE TO SURVIVE WAS VIRTUALLY NONEXISTENT. SO WE GOT THE DIAGNOSIS OF BEAU. HE HAD STAGE-FOUR GLIOBLASTOMA OF THE BRAIN, NOBODY... AND SO... BUT HERE IS THE KIND OF KID HE WAS. HE WAS A 45-YEAR-OLD MAN. HE WAS THE ATTORNEY GENERAL OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE. HE WAS A BRONZE STAR, A DECORATED WAR VETERAN THAT DIDN'T HAVE TO GO AND VOLUNTEERED TO GO FOR A YEAR. HE VOLUNTEERED TO GO TO KOSOVO, JUSTICE DEPARTMENT IN THE MIDDLE OF PRISTINE -- IN THE MIDDLE OF THE WAR. HE -- I MEAN, THIS WAS A KID WHO WAS JUST ABSOLUTELY... EVERYTHING ABOUT HIM WAS A SENSE OF DUTY AND OBLIGATION. YOU KNOW WHAT STRUCK ME ABOUT WHAT I READ ABOUT HIM IS THAT HE WAS GOING TO A CELEBRATION OF IRAQI WAR VETERANS, AND HE WON'T EVEN WEAR HIS... YEAH, HE WOULDN'T PUT ON HIS MEDALS. HE WOULDN'T WEAR HIS METALS. HE GOT A CALL FROM GENERAL ODIERNO. YEAH. SAID, ""BEAU, THIS IS AN ORDER. CAPTAIN, PUT ON YOUR MEDALS."" FIRST TIME HE EVER PUT THEM ON. WOW. WHEN HE WON THE BRONZE, HE SAID, ""DAD, DON'T TELL ANYBODY""... YEAH. ...""DON'T TELL PEOPLE ABOUT THIS, OKAY?"" WHEN HE WON THE BRONZE MEDAL, HE SAID, ""DON'T TELL ANYBODY."" NO, HE DIDN'T TELL ME TILL HE GOT HOME. OH. SO... BUT... AND WHEN HE WENT INTO SERVICE, HE SAID, ""I DON'T WANT TO USE THE NAME BIDEN."" YOU KNOW HOW THEY ALL HAVE... YEAH. I'VE BEEN IN AND OUT OF IRAQ AND AFGHANISTAN 28 TIMES, SO I GOT TO SEE HIM WHEN HE WAS THERE ON THREE DIFFERENT OCCASIONS, AND AT FIRST, HE WOULD NOT WEAR -- YOU KNOW, THEY HAVE THEIR NAME. RIGHT. HE GOT PERMISSION TO HAVE ANOTHER NAME. I THINK HE USED ""HUNTER,"" HIS MOTHER'S MAIDEN NAME, YOU KNOW, BUT HE WOULDN'T USE ""BIDEN"" BECAUSE HE DID NOT WANT TO BE TREATED ANY DIFFERENTLY. SO HOW DID HE TELL YOU... WELL... ...THAT WAS IT STAGE FOUR? HOW DID YOU HEAR? WELL, I WAS WITH HIM. HE WAS FIRST DIAGNOSED WITH HAVING HAD A STROKE. HE CAME OUT OF THE MILITARY. HE WAS DEEMED THE FITTEST GUY IN HIS BATTALION. THEY DO THESE TESTS. HE HAD -- I THINK IT WAS 9%, 10% BODY FAT. I MEAN, HE WAS A RUNNER, AND ONE DAY WHEN HE WAS RUNNING, HE STARTED TO KIND OF HALLUCINATE. MM. AND IT WORRIED HIM. HE DIDN'T WANT TO TELL ANYBODY, AND FINALLY, HE TOLD HIS BROTHER, WHO WAS HIS LIFELINE, HUNTER, ABOUT IT, AND THEY EVENTUALLY TOLD ME, AND THEN, ONE DAY, I'M GOING DOWN TO WASHINGTON AFTER BEING HOME ON THE WEEKEND, AND MY SECRET SERVICE AGENT COMES IN, AND HE SAYS, ""MR. VICE PRESIDENT, MR. VICE PRESIDENT, THE GENERAL IS DOWN. THE GENERAL IS DOWN,"" REFERRING TO MY SON, THE ATTORNEY GENERAL. HE SAID, ""HE'S DOWN. HE'S DOWN."" I CAME RUNNING OUT. I SAID, ""WHAT DO YOU MEAN?"" HE SAID, ""AN AMBULANCE IS COMING FOR HIM AT HIS HOME. HE'S DOWN. I DON'T KNOW WHAT..."" AND SO I GOT TO -- HIS HOUSE WAS ONLY A MILE AND A HALF AWAY. I RODE IN WITH HIM, AND HE WAS PARALYZED, AND HE LOST HIS ABILITY TO SPEAK, AND HE KEPT GOING, ""AH, AH..."" WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON? AND THEY DIAGNOSED, AND THEY DID THE MRI. THEY SHOWED WHERE THE CLOT WAS IN THE BRAIN. AND IT WAS DIAGNOSED, INITIALLY, AS A STROKE THAT RESOLVED ITSELF. IT'S A LONG STORY, DON'T WANT TO BORE YOU WITH IT, BUT NEXT THING, WELL, IT TURNS OUT IT WAS THE BEGINNING OF THE GROWTH OF THIS CANCER. MM. AND SO WHEN HE KEPT GETTING WORSE, WE WENT DOWN TO MD ANDERSON IN AUGUST, AND THEY DIAGNOSED HIM WITH STAGE-FOUR GLIOBLASTOMA, AND HUNTER AND ASHLEY AND JILL AND I AND HE ALL MADE A DEAL. WE WOULD NOT TALK ABOUT THE PERCENTAGES BECAUSE WE JUST HAD HOPE. WITHOUT HOPE, YOU CAN'T LIVE, AND SO THAT'S HOW I BEGAN TO GET KNOWLEDGE ABOUT CANCER. I TRIED TO LEARN EVERYTHING I POSSIBLY COULD ABOUT THE DISEASE. AND WHAT BEAU WOULD DO IS, I WOULD SEE HIM, AND HE'D SAY, ""DAD."" HE'D SAY, ""DAD, LOOK AT ME. STOP LOOKING SAD. DON'T LOOK SAD, DAD. NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENS, I'M GOING TO BE ALL RIGHT, DAD. YOU'VE GOT TO LOOK HAPPY. YOU'VE GOT TO LOOK STRONG FOR THE FAMILY, DAD. THE FAMILY NEEDS YOU TO LOOK STRONG, DAD."" AND I'M NOT EXAGGERATING. I MEAN, IT'S LIKE -- HE WAS A REMARKABLE YOUNG MAN. I'M NOT SUGGESTING OTHER PEOPLE... I'M JUST SPEAKING ABOUT HIM, THOUGH. IT WAS ALWAYS ABOUT EVERYBODY ELSE WITH BEAU. YOU KNOW, MY DAD HAD AN EXPRESSION WHEN GROWING UP HE WOULD TEACH. HE SAID, ""JOEY, NEVER EXPLAIN AND NEVER COMPLAIN."" I CAN SAY, GIVE MY WORD AS A BIDEN, I NEVER, ONE SINGLE TIME FROM THE MOMENT HE WAS BORN, EVER HEARD BEAU BIDEN COMPLAIN... MM. ...NOT ONE SINGLE TIME. IT IS A LOT EASIER FOR THE PRESS TO COVER WHETHER OR NOT HE GROPED A WOMAN OR WHETHER SHE SENT AN E-MAIL THAN IT IS TO DETERMINE HOW YOU PAY FOR FREE COLLEGE EDUCATION. YOU HAVE NO REGRET IN THE DEEPEST, QUIETEST, PUREST MOMENTS ABOUT NOT ACTUALLY RUNNING? IT'S BEEN A YEAR SINCE THE OPENING OF THE SMITHSONIAN NATIONAL MUSEUM OF AFRICAN AMERICAN HISTORY & CULTURE. NOW A RECORD-BREAKING NUMBER OF PEOPLE HAVE VISITED TO UNDERSTAND AND REFLECT ON OUR JOURNEY. Oprah: JOE BIDEN WAS BORN IN SCRANTON, PENNSYLVANIA. HE WAS RAISED BY HIS MOTHER, CATHERINE, AND HIS FATHER, JOSEPH SR., WHO CLEANED FURNACES AND LATER SOLD USED CARS. THE FAMILY LATER MOVED TO MAYFIELD, DELAWARE, WHERE JOE JR. WASHED WINDOWS AND WEEDED GARDENS TO HELP PAY TUITION FOR THE PRESTIGIOUS ARCHMERE ACADEMY, A PRIVATE SCHOOL JOE SAID WAS HIS DEEPEST DESIRE TO ATTEND. HE WOULD GO ON TO THE UNIVERSITY OF DELAWARE AND LATER LAW SCHOOL AT SYRACUSE. IN 1972, JOE BIDEN WAS ELECTED U.S. SENATOR FOR THE STATE OF DELAWARE. YOU KNOW, WHAT I WAS STRUCK BY, I READ THAT EVER SINCE YOU WERE A LITTLE BOY, YOU WERE A BOY WITH A VISION, THAT YOU HAD A PICTURE IN YOUR HEAD OF THE KIND OF MAN THAT YOU WANTED TO BE. DID YOU LIVE UP TO YOUR OWN EXPECTATIONS? DID YOU FULFILL THE VISION OR EXCEED THE VISION? I, BY AND LARGE, BELIEVE THAT I HAVE ENDED UP BEING THE MAN I WANTED TO BE, BUT IT WASN'T IN TERMS OF ACCOMPLISHMENT. MM. IT WAS BECAUSE PEOPLE USUALLY TRANSLATE THAT IN A, YOU KNOW, AS A YOUNG GUY, I KNEW I WANTED TO BE SENATOR. I KNEW I WANTED TO BE PRESIDENT. I KNEW -- THAT WASN'T TRUE. WHAT WAS TRUE WAS I WANT TO LIVE UP TO MY PARENTS' EXPECTATION. MM. AND I WANTED TO BE THAT PERSON THAT MET MY MOTHER'S STANDARD, BEING DEFINED BY MY COURAGE. I WANTED TO BE THAT PERSON WHO WAS, NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENED, JUST GOT BACK UP AND KEPT GOING. I WANTED TO BE THAT PERSON WHO WAS THERE AND LOYAL TO PEOPLE WHO WERE LOYAL TO HIM. I WANTED TO BE THERE. I WANTED TO BE THAT GUY WHO KNEW WHAT WAS WORTH LOSING OVER. DID YOU KNOW AS A LITTLE BOY, WHEN YOU HAD THE VISION AS A LITTLE BOY, WHEN YOU HAVE THIS PICTURE IN YOUR HEAD, WHAT WAS THE PICTURE? THE PICTURE, IT VARIED AS I GOT OLDER. WHAT IT CAME DOWN TO WAS, I REALIZED, EVERYTHING IN MY FAMILY AND IN MY FAITH WAS ABOUT THE ABUSE OF POWER, THAT WE HAD AN OBLIGATION TO CHALLENGE THE ABUSE OF POWER, WHETHER IT WAS STARTING OFF AS A KID IN THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT AND SIT-INS AND BEING THE ONLY WHITE EMPLOYEE IN THE EAST SIDE OF THE CITY, OR WHETHER IT WAS, YOU KNOW, CHALLENGING THE SAME THINGS WHEN I RAN FOR ELECTION THAT I KNEW WERE NOT POPULAR BUT I BELIEVED AND... MM-HMM. ...BECAUSE I BELIEVE PEOPLE ULTIMATELY REWARD YOU FOR AUTHENTICITY. DON'T YOU THINK, TOO -- THIS IS INTERESTING. WHEN I THINK ABOUT YOU, BECAUSE EVERYBODY KNOWS THAT YOU'RE GETTING ON THE TRAIN EVERY NIGHT AND GOING HOME AND, YOU KNOW, SWORN INTO OFFICE, ACTUALLY, IN THE HOSPITAL WHEN YOUR BOYS WERE THERE, AND SO YOU WERE A DEDICATED FATHER GOING BACK AND FORTH FROM DELAWARE TO D.C. DON'T YOU THINK THAT ACTUALLY BEING ON THAT TRAIN EVERY DAY WAS A... BEST THING THAT EVER HAPPENED TO ME. ...GROUNDING MECHANISM? ABSOLUTELY. BECAUSE I REMEMBER LIVING IN BALTIMORE, TAKING THE TRAIN TO NEW YORK OR GOING TO D.C., THERE WAS SOMETHING ABOUT LOOKING OUT THE WINDOW, WHICH I ACTUALLY LOVE EVEN NOW DRIVING IN A CAR AND SEEING PEOPLES' HOMES... ABSOLUTELY. ...YEAH, AND THINKING ABOUT... ABSOLUTELY. ...""I WONDER WHAT THEY'RE EATING TONIGHT.""    WHAT ARE THEY TALKING ABOUT AT THAT KITCHEN TABLE? WHAT ARE THEY TALKING ABOUT AT THE KITCHEN TABLE? YOU LOOK OUT ON THAT STRETCH BETWEEN BALTIMORE AND ABERDEEN... YEAH, YEAH. ...AND THEN SEE ALL THOSE LIGHTS ON, AND YOU WONDER, ""WHAT WERE THEY TALKING ABOUT?"" FOR EXAMPLE -- BY THE WAY, THE REASON I WENT HOME WAS I NEEDED MY KIDS MORE THAN THEY NEEDED ME. I MEAN, I REALLY DID, BUT, YOU KNOW, AS A PARENT, YOU KNOW A CHILD CAN ONLY HOLD AN IMPORTANT THOUGHT FOR ABOUT 12 HOURS. IF YOU MISS IT, YOU MISS IT. SO EVEN THOUGH I WASN'T OZZIE AND HARRIET, WE HAD BREAKFAST AND DINNER MADE, I'D GO HOME AND LIE IN BED WITH THEM, AND THEY'D TALK AND GET UP, AND SO... BUT THE THING THAT WAS THE BEST WOULD HAPPEN, YOU'D BE IN WASHINGTON, AND THERE'D BE A VOTE, AND YOU'D CROSS CONSTITUTION, AND THE COP WOULD STOP THE TRAFFIC, AND AFTER A WHILE, YOU'D BE GETTING TO THINK, ""WELL, WHAT TOOK HIM SO LONG, YOU KNOW?"" BUT YOU'D GET ON THE TRAIN, AND YOU'D GO HOME, AND THE SHOE-SHINE GUY, WHO'S A GOOD FRIEND OF MINE, WOULD SAY, ""JOE, WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING DOWN THERE, MAN? COME HERE."" YEAH. I MEAN, NOT A JOKE, NOT A JOKE. IF YOU NOTICE, IF YOU EVER BEEN TO DELAWARE, FROM THE TIME I RAN, I'VE BEEN REFERRED TO AS ""JOE."" THAT'S ALL. THEY DON'T CALL ME SENATOR. EVEN TODAY, THE SECRET SERVICE LOOKS WHEN THEY GO, ""HEY, JOE, COME HERE,"" YOU KNOW. THESE ARE CONSTITUENTS, AND THEY'RE KIND OF LIKE, ""OH, WHAT'S GOING ON HERE?"" BUT IT REALLY DOES GROUND YOU, MAN, BECAUSE THEY KNOW YOU. EVEN AFTER BECOMING VICE PRESIDENT? OH, ABSOLUTELY! SO IT REALLY KEEPS YOU FROM EVER GETTING TO THE POINT WHERE YOU FEEL SELF-IMPORTANT. YEAH. I KNOW THIS SOUNDS LIKE HYPERBOLE, BUT IT REALLY IS TRUE. IT WAS A GIFT. IF IT KEEPS YOU SO CONNECTED TO THE PEOPLE AND WHERE THE PEOPLE ARE, AND EVERYBODY NOW KNOWS HOW BADLY THE MEDIA GOT IT WRONG, YOU MUST HAVE HAD SOME INKLING. YOU MUST'VE HAD -- YOU MUST'VE NOT HAVE BEEN SHOCKED THEN ON ELECTION NIGHT... OPRAH... ...IF YOU WERE ACTUALLY ON THE TRAIN TALKING TO PEOPLE WITH THE PEOPLE. I DIDN'T DRIVE... AS VICE PRESIDENT, I TOOK THE TRAIN ON THE WEEKEND. I DIDN'T GO EVERY DAY, BUT I DID 83 EVENTS, AND A MONTH OUT, I CAME BACK AND SAID, ""WE'RE GOING TO LOSE THIS ELECTION."" A MONTH OUT? A MONTH OUT. MM. AND THE REASON I DID, YOU KNOW, I KNOW I'M CALLED ""MIDDLE CLASS JOE"". IN WASHINGTON, THAT'S NOT MEANT AS A COMPLIMENT. IT MEANS YOU'RE NOT SOPHISTICATED, YOU KNOW. BUT WHAT WAS HAPPENING IS THE REASON I BELIEVE WE WERE GOING TO LOSE -- AND I THINK HILLARY WOULD'VE BEEN A GREAT PRESIDENT. I REALLY DO. I THINK SHE WOULD'VE BEEN A GREAT PRESIDENT. BUT THERE'S TWO STUDIES THAT JUST CAME OUT. ONE WAS ANNENBERG SCHOOL. I FORGET THE OTHER ONE. I APOLOGIZE NOW, BUT IT LOOKED AT ALL THE WORDS UTTERED IN A CAMPAIGN. HOW MANY OF THOSE WORDS RELATED TO AN ISSUE? FEWER WORDS WERE UTTERED RELATED TO ANY SPECIFIC ISSUE THIS LAST CAMPAIGN THAN ANY CAMPAIGN IN THE LAST 10 PRESIDENTIAL RACES. NOW YOU ARE AN INCREDIBLY WELL-INFORMED PERSON. I'LL BET YOU CAN'T FIND 10 FRIENDS WHO CAN TELL YOU WHAT HILLARY'S POSITION WAS ON CHILD CARE, NOT GENERICALLY, SPECIFICALLY. RIGHT. HOW WE'RE GOING TO HAVE FREE COLLEGE EDUCATION, HOW IT'S GOING TO BE PAID FOR, ALL THE THINGS THAT MATTER TO THOSE PEOPLE -- AND BY THE WAY, WE WOULDN'T BE HAVING THIS DISCUSSION BUT FOR 172,000 VOTES. LET US PUT THAT IN PERSPECTIVE TOO, OKAY? MM-HMM. MM-HMM. BUT IN THE STATES, THEY HAD ME GOING IN, I SPENT ALL MY TIME IN PENNSYLVANIA, OHIO, MINNESOTA, MICHIGAN, WISCONSIN, FLORIDA, VIRGINIA. THEY'RE THE PLACES -- AND THIS IS NOT A CRITICISM, BUT I THINK WHAT HAPPENED IS WE GOT TO THE POINT WHERE IT BECAME IDENTITY POLITICS. MM-HMM. AND THEY LEARNED THE WRONG LESSONS FROM BARACK'S BRILLIANT CAMPAIGNS HE RAN. AND FOR EXAMPLE, THE END OF THE CAMPAIGN, I WENT UP TO A UNION HALL TO MAKE A POINT, AND I SAID, ""YOU KNOW, ONE OF THE REASONS HILLARY HAS TO WIN..."" THERE'S LIKE 2,000 UNION GUYS. ""SO ONE OF THE REASONS HILLARY HAS TO WIN? IMPORTANT BECAUSE THEY NEED EQUAL PAY FOR WOMEN."" PLACE WENT NUTS. YOU KNOW WHY? ALL THEIR WIVES WERE THE POLITICAL TYPES. THEY DON'T LIKE THE FACT THEIR WIFE ISN'T BEING PAID WHERE THE WIVES WHO AREN'T BEING PAID FAIRLY ARE IN CORPORATIONS AND LAW FIRMS IN SILICON VALLEY, BUT THESE GUYS' WIVES ARE HIGH SCHOOL-EDUCATED KIDS, AND THEY'RE NOT GOTTEN PAID. AND I SAID, ""AND SECONDLY, LOOK, IT'S NONE OF YOUR BUSINESS WHO THE HELL YOU MARRIED, MAN. LET WELL ENOUGH ALONE, PERIOD."" CHEERED! THEY'RE CHEERING! I'M NOT JOKING. NOW THE PRESS SAID, ""ONLY BIDEN COULD DO THAT."" THAT'S NOT TRUE. YOU GOT TO STATE WHAT YOU'RE FOR, AND IF YOU GET SUCKERED INTO NOT HAVING THE TIME -- IN FAIRNESS TO THE PRESS, IT'S A LOT EASIER FOR THE PRESS TO COVER WHETHER OR NOT HE GROPED A WOMAN OR WHETHER SHE SENT AN E-MAIL THAN IT IS TO DETERMINE HOW YOU PAY FOR FREE COLLEGE EDUCATION, THAN IT IS TO GO IN AND LOOK AT WHAT YOUR POSITION IS ON REAL TAX EQUITY. I MEAN, IT'S JUST EASIER. IT'S EASIER, AND IT'S ALMOST LIKE THEY CAN'T NOT COVER IT. THEY CAN'T NOT COVER IT, AND SO IF YOU LOOK AT ALL THE COVERAGE, THERE'S HARDLY ANY COVERAGE ABOUT THE THINGS THAT MATTER TO THE LIVES OF ORDINARY PEOPLE. DO YOU FEEL THAT YOU COULD'VE BEATEN HILLARY? HOW CAN YOU HELP US AS A NATION BRING DIGNITY BACK TO OUR CONVERSATIONS? YOU HAVE NO REGRET IN THE DEEPEST, QUIETEST, PUREST MOMENTS ABOUT NOT ACTUALLY RUNNING? I HAVE A REGRET THAT I AM NOT PRESIDENT, BECAUSE I THINK THERE'S SO MUCH OPPORTUNITY. MM. I THINK AMERICA IS SO INCREDIBLY WELL-POSITIONED. BUT I DON'T REGRET THE DECISION I MADE BECAUSE IT WAS THE RIGHT DECISION FOR MY FAMILY. OPRAH, NO WOMAN OR MAN SHOULD ANNOUNCE THEY'RE RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT UNLESS THEY CAN ANSWER TWO QUESTIONS. YEAH. ONE, DO THEY TRULY BELIEVE THEY'RE THE MOST QUALIFIED PERSON FOR THAT MOMENT? I BELIEVED I WAS, BUT WAS I PREPARED TO BE ABLE TO GIVE MY WHOLE HEART, MY WHOLE SOUL, AND ALL MY ATTENTION TO THE ENDEAVOR? AND I KNEW I WASN'T. WERE YOU STILL BROKEN? MY FAMILY WAS BROKEN. I WAS BROKEN, AND I FIND MYSELF EVEN, LIKE, YOU KNOW, THIS IS WHY I KNOW THERE WAS SEXISM IN THE CAMPAIGN. I WOULD BE SPEAKING SOMEWHERE AND SOMEONE WOULD YELL, ""BEAU BIDEN"" AND I'D SAY, ""BEAU,"" AND I'D FIND MYSELF BREAKING DOWN, AND PEOPLE WOULD SAY, ""WASN'T HE A GOOD FATHER?"" IF HILLARY BROKE DOWN, THEY WOULD'VE SAID, ""SHE'S PLAYING THE WOMAN CARD."" MM-HMM. MM-HMM. SO IT WAS... SO I JUST KNEW. I JUST... DO YOU FEEL YOU THAT COULD'VE BEATEN HILLARY? I... YES, BUT IT WOULD'VE BEEN AN INCREDIBLY DIFFICULT RACE, AND I HAVE NOTHING BUT FRIENDSHIP FOR HILLARY. DID YOU NOT WANT TO TAKE THAT ON? BECAUSE WHEN EVERYONE WAS GETTING EXCITED ABOUT THE POSSIBILITY OF YOU JOINING THE RACE, THERE WAS ALSO OBVIOUSLY A LOT OF SPECULATION THAT YOU WOULDN'T WANT TO GET IN AND TAKE ON... YES. ...THE CLINTON FACTOR. WELL, HERE IS WHAT THE SPECULATION WAS. YOU'RE RIGHT ABOUT THAT. MM-HMM. THE OTHER SPECULATION WAS BIDEN WOULDN'T WANT TO BE THE GUY DENYING A WOMAN THE OPPORTUNITY. YEAH. YEAH. IT WAS REAL SIMPLE. MY SON WAS DYING. MM. I COULDN'T TELL ANYBODY.    THE ONLY PERSON I COULD CONFIDE IN WAS BARACK. HE'S THE ONLY ONE WHO HAD TO KNOW, SO WHAT I WASN'T ABLE TO DO -- HILLARY, AS I SAID, IS A FRIEND. WHEN SHE WAS SECRETARY OF STATE WE HAD BREAKFAST ONCE A WEEK AT MY HOME, SO SHE CALLED ME, AND SHE WANTED -- I'M SURE SHE DOESN'T MIND MY SAYING THIS -- SHE CALLED ME. SHE WANTED TO COME DOWN AND TALK ABOUT THE RACE. SHE WANTED TO KNOW WHETHER I WAS GOING TO RUN. WHETHER YOU WERE GOING TO RUN OR NOT. AND I SAT DOWN, AND I SAID, ""HILLARY, LOOK. IT'S MUCH LESS LIKELY THAT I RUN THAN NOT RUN, BUT IF I DO, IT'LL BE STRAIGHT UP. IT'S NOT ABOUT YOU. IT'S ABOUT ME."" BUT WE HAD SOME HOPE BECAUSE I WAS TOLD THAT THEY DECIDED TO TRY SOME EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES ON DEALING WITH GLIOBLASTOMA. THEY INJECTED HIM WITH A THING CALLED ANTI-PD-1, AND THEY INJECTED A VIRUS INTO HIS BRAIN, AND THERE WAS THIS ONE FAINT POSSIBILITY. SO IT GAVE YOU HOPE FOR HOW LONG? WELL, WE NEVER GAVE UP HOPE, BUT IT WAS... WE THOUGHT IN JANUARY -- I THOUGHT IN JANUARY OR FEBRUARY THERE WAS A 25% CHANCE MAYBE WE BEAT THE ODDS. MM. BUT WHAT I COULDN'T DO, BECAUSE HE WOULD'VE KILLED ME -- IF I ANNOUNCED I WASN'T RUNNING BECAUSE OF MY SON BECAUSE HE WANTED ME TO RUN. YEAH. WHEN DID HE TELL YOU TO RUN? BECAUSE THAT BECAME... I THOUGHT YOU WERE GOING TO RUN JUST BECAUSE OF BEAU'S WISH THAT YOU WOULD RUN. EVERY THANKSGIVING FOR 42 YEARS SINCE I MET JILL, WE WOULD GO TO NANTUCKET FOR THANKSGIVING WHEN THEY WERE LITTLE BOYS... MM-HMM. ...SO WE WOULDN'T OFFEND HER PARENTS, MY PARENTS, AND/OR MY DECEASED WIFE'S PARENTS. THEY WERE ALL GOING. THIS WAS A NUCLEAR HOLIDAY. NOW 16 OF US TRUDGE UP. AND SO WE WERE IN NANTUCKET, AND WE DID THE CHRISTMAS LIGHTING. BEAU WAS SICK, AND HE SAID, ""DAD, WE GOT TO TALK,"" AND WE WENT BACK TO THE HOUSE WE WERE STAYING IN AND THEN SAT DOWN AND SAID, ""YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND, DAD. WE WANT YOU TO RUN."" THIS WAS HUNT AND BEAU, AND HUNT ARGUED THIS WILL KEEP THE FAMILY TOGETHER. IT WILL GIVE US PURPOSE, BUT I JUST DIDN'T HAVE THE COURAGE TO DO IT. I JUST DIDN'T THINK I COULD SAY TO THE PUBLIC THAT, YOU KNOW, THIS IS... I'M NOT GOING TO DIVERT WHEN MY LITTLE GRANDSON SAYS, ""POP, YOU SMELL LIKE DADDY. CAN I LIE DOWN WITH YOU?"" MM. YOU KNOW? BY THE WAY, A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE THAT, BUT AS I'M PRESIDENT, I KNEW I COULDN'T... NOW THEY DIDN'T MAKE ANY DEMANDS. THE WHOLE FAMILY GOT TOGETHER EVEN AFTER BEAU PASSED AND SAID, ""YOU'VE GOT TO RUN, JOE."" JILL WANTED ME TO RUN, BUT I JUST -- IN THE END, THE DECISION WAS ""NO"" BECAUSE WHAT? YOU DIDN'T HAVE THE EYE OF THE TIGER? BECAUSE I DIDN'T HAVE THE EYE OF THE TIGER. I KNEW THAT I WAS STILL SO, UM... I KNEW I WAS MISSING HIM SO THAT I DIDN'T THINK I COULD DO THE JOB THAT I WOULD HAVE TO DO, BUT THAT'S NOT SAYING, DO I REGRET NOT BEING PRESIDENT? YEAH, I DO, BUT I MADE THE RIGHT DECISION FOR MY FAMILY, I BELIEVE, AT THAT TIME, AND I THOUGHT THAT WE HAD A REALLY INCREDIBLY QUALIFIED CANDIDATE TO BE PRESIDENT, SO I DIDN'T FEEL LIKE I WAS LEAVING THE FIELD, AND BECAUSE I LEFT THE FIELD THAT THERE WASN'T ANYBODY WHO COULD, YOU KNOW, RUN THE COUNTRY. I DIDN'T FEEL THAT WAY. HAS THERE BEEN A THOUGHT OR CONSIDERATION FOR 2020? OVER 2 MILLION PEOPLE HAVE MADE THE TRIP TO WASHINGTON, D.C. TO EXPERIENCE THE PLIGHT AND TRIUMPH DISPLAYED WITHIN THE SMITHSONIAN NATIONAL MUSEUM OF AFRICAN AMERICAN HISTORY & CULTURE. WE HONOR AND CELEBRATE THIS 1-YEAR-OLD NATIONAL TREASURE. FOLKS, EACH OF YOU HAS A RESPONSIBILITY. YOU ALL KNOW IT. YOU'VE BEEN TAUGHT IT HERE. YOU WERE TAUGHT IT BEFORE YOU CAME HERE, TO TREAT PEOPLE WITH DIGNITY. YOU DEMAND IT FOR YOURSELVES. YOU DEMAND THAT YOU BE TREATED THAT WAY, AND ALL OF US, ALL OF US HAVE TO DO BETTER WHEN IT COMES TO BUILDING THE BONDS OF EMPATHY THAT FOLKS WHO AREN'T LIKE US... ...AREN'T LIKE US, CAN KNOW WE UNDERSTAND THEM. LIFE CAN'T BE LIVED IN THIS SELF-REFERENTIAL, SELF-REINFORCING, SELF-RIGHTEOUS ECHO CHAMBER WE BUILD FOR OURSELVES ONLINE. LIVING IN OUR SCREENS ENCOURAGES SHALLOW AND ANTISEPTIC RELATIONSHIPS THAT MAKE IT EASY TO REDUCE OTHERS TO STEREOTYPES. HOW CAN YOU HELP US AS A NATION BRING DIGNITY BACK TO OUR CONVERSATIONS? I HEARD YOU SPEAK ABOUT THIS. BY ACTING WITH DIGNITY... YEAH. ...BY NOT GETTING DOWN INTO THE MOSH PIT. RIGHT. SO FROM A BIGGER POINT OF VIEW, SOCIAL, SPIRITUAL POINT OF VIEW, WHERE WE ARE AS A NATION, AS A CULTURE OF PEOPLE, HOW BAD IS IT, DO YOU THINK? I DON'T THINK IT'S -- LET ME TELL YOU WHAT I THINK THE UNDERLYING CAUSE OF ANGST IS. IT GOES BEYOND POLITICS. WE'RE GOING THROUGH SUCH A GIGANTIC TRANSITION. THE CONSEQUENCE OF DIGITALIZATION, SUPERCOMPUTING CAPABILITY, ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE, THE ABILITY TO DO THINGS THAT HAD TO BE DONE BY AN INDIVIDUAL NO LONGER HAVING TO BE DONE CAN BE DONE BY A MACHINE IS SCARING THE LIVING HELL OUT OF PEOPLE. MY DAD USED TO HAVE AN EXPRESSION, ""JOEY, A JOB IS ABOUT A LOT MORE THAN A PAYCHECK. IT'S ABOUT YOUR DIGNITY, YOUR RESPECT, YOUR PLACE IN THE COMMUNITY, BEING ABLE TO LOOK YOUR KID IN THE EYE AND SAY, 'IT'S GOING TO BE OKAY.' THAT'S WHAT A JOB IS ABOUT."" AND SO NOW YOU HAVE GOT TENS OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE, MILLIONS OF PEOPLE, BLACK AND WHITE, LOOKING OUT THERE AND HEARING THE DEBATE GOING ON ABOUT GLOBALIZATION, AND THE QUESTION IS, HOW DO YOU ADJUST THAT GLOBALIZATION TO MEET PEOPLES' NEEDS? SO HAS THERE BEEN A THOUGHT OR CONSIDERATION FOR 2020? NO, NOT YET. NO? AND I SAY THAT ""NOT YET"" BECAUSE, LOOK, I'M A GREAT RESPECTER OF FATE. I DON'T PLAN ON RUNNING, BUT I TELL YOU WHAT, I PLAN ON GOING, AND HERE IS MY PROBLEM. YOU KNOW, I LEARNED HOW TO BECOME ONE OF THE MOST POPULAR ELECTED OFFICIALS IN THE UNITED STATES. I'M ACTUALLY NOT RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT. IT'S AMAZING. BOOM, THINGS GO. YOU KNOW, IT REALLY GETS GOOD, BUT I'M ASKED TO SPEAK A LOT IN POLITICAL FORA, AND I'M DOING IT NOT AS NEARLY AS OFTEN AS I'M ASKED, BECAUSE EVERY TIME I'M ASKED, THEY SAY THEY TRANSLATED IT AS I'M RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT. BUT I'M GOING TO DO EVERYTHING I CAN TO CHANGE THE DYNAMIC HERE BECAUSE I THINK WE CAN WIN BACK THE HOUSE, AND I THINK WE HAVE A SHOT AT THE SENATE, AND YOU KNOW, THE OTHER EXPRESSION MY DAD USED WAS, ""LOOK, DON'T COMPARE ME TO THE ALMIGHTY. COMPARE ME TO THE ALTERNATIVE."" WELL, RIGHT NOW, I LOOK AWFUL GOOD. BUT I CAN GO OUT AND DO THAT, RAISE MONEY AND DO THOSE THINGS, BUT I'M NOT SITTING HERE NOW. I'M, AS I SAID, A GREAT RESPECTER OF FATE. I'M OVER 70. I'M, THANK GOD, RIGHT NOW, IN AWFUL GOOD HEALTH, YOU KNOW, BUT I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE HELL WHAT THINGS ARE GOING TO BE 2 YEARS FROM NOW. I JUST DON'T KNOW. SO I PROMISE YOU I'M NOT DOING ANYTHING TO ORGANIZE RUNNING, BUT I'M GOING TO GO OUT THERE AND CONTINUE TO DO WHAT I'VE DONE SINCE I'VE BEEN 26 YEARS OLD... MM-HMM. ...HOLLER. WHAT IS IT, DO YOU THINK, THAT IT'S ABOUT POWER THAT CHANGES PEOPLE, AND HOW HAVE YOU MANAGED THE POWER YOU'VE HELD? WHAT HAPPENS IN THAT MOMENT WHEN YOU CAN LITERALLY SEE THE SPIRIT GOES SOMEPLACE? WHAT IS IT, DO YOU THINK, THAT IT'S ABOUT POWER THAT CHANGES PEOPLE, AND HOW HAVE YOU MANAGED THE POWER YOU'VE HELD? WELL, I HAVEN'T HELD THAT MUCH POWER. MY POWER, THE REASON I'M VIEWED AS HAVING THAT POWER IS ALL... THERE'S NO POWER IN THE VICE PRESIDENCY. IT'S ALL REFLECTIVE, AND IT COMES FROM THE PRESIDENT. BUT I THINK THE PEOPLE ABUSE POWER IS THAT THEY, IN FACT, ARE SEDUCED BY THE NOTION THAT THEY ARE SO SELF-IMPORTANT THAT THEY REALLY MATTER WHEN, IN FACT, IT IS NOT USUALLY THE CASE. THE ONLY WAY -- THE LEADERS I'VE OBSERVED WHO WERE THE BEST ARE THE ONES WHO HAVE COURAGE TO TAKE A CHANCE, BE WILLING TO LOSE ON PRINCIPLE, AND TWO, ARE SELF-AWARE. THEY UNDERSTAND THEIR STRENGTHS, AND THEY UNDERSTAND THEIR WEAKNESSES. THEY PLAY TO THEIR STRENGTHS, AND THEY TRY TO SHORE UP THEIR WEAKNESSES, AND THE PEOPLE WHO DON'T DO THAT ARE THE PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT SELF-AWARE ENOUGH TO KNOW WHAT THEIR -- BECAUSE MOST OF THE TIME, THAT ABUSE ENDS UP BEING THEIR DOWNFALL AS WELL. WE SEE SO MUCH ON THE NEWS EVERY DAY, RAGE AND ANGER ON BOTH SIDES. WHAT DO YOU THINK IS THE SOURCE OF ALL THIS RAGE AND FUROR? WELL, I THINK IT'S BECAUSE THEY THINK THE SYSTEM HAS FAILED THEM. I THINK THEY LOOK OUT AT THE CONGRESS, AND FOR THE LAST -- SINCE BARACK GOT ELECTED, THE FIRST THING REPUBLICANS DID WAS SAY, ""HOW CAN WE KEEP HIM FROM SUCCEEDING AT ALL?"" YEAH. AND SO THE CONGRESS HAS BEEN SITTING DOWN... WHEN YOU THINK OF -- ...I THINK, AT 11%. WHEN I WAS IN THE CONGRESS, WE WERE MORE DIVIDED, BUT WE ACTUALLY KNEW THERE HAD TO BE WORK TOGETHER TO GET CONSENSUS, TO GET THINGS DONE. I ALSO THINK THEY LOOK OUT AT THE POLITICAL SYSTEM, AND THEY THINK THAT THEY ARE POWERLESS. THEY'RE POWERLESS BECAUSE THEY DON'T POSSESS MONEY AND POWER TO INFLUENCE VOTES, INFLUENCE OUTCOMES. WHAT ARE YOU MOST PROUD OF, JOE? I'M MOST PROUD OF, AT LEAST TO THIS POINT, OF HAVING SERVED AS LONG AS I DID, AND DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS STILL ACCEPTING MY WORD AND TREATING ME AS IF I'M HONORABLE. I AM PROUD OF BEING ABLE TO SAY THAT I NEVER VOTED FOR ANYTHING THAT I DISAGREED WITH. MM. WHEN I WAS AGNOSTIC ABOUT IT, I'D LOOK AT WHATEVER MY CONSTITUENTS WANTED. I WOULD VOTE FOR IT, BUT I NEVER VOTED FOR ANYTHING THAT I FELT WAS WRONG. NOW THAT YOU'VE HAD TIME TO WRITE A BOOK AND REFLECT ON YOUR LIFE AND DECISIONS, DO YOU THINK DIFFERENTLY ABOUT THAT MOMENT WHEN PRESIDENT OBAMA WAS GIVING YOU THE MEDAL OF FREEDOM? WHAT STRUCK ME ABOUT THAT MOMENT IS YOU KEPT SAYING, ""I DON'T DESERVE THIS,"" AND I WAS THINKING, ""OF COURSE, YOU DESERVE IT."" DO YOU THINK... WELL, YOU KNOW... ...DIFFERENTLY NOW THAT... I STILL DON'T THINK... YOU DON'T? LOOK, I THINK I'M A... I HOPE I'M A DECENT MAN. I HOPE I'VE DONE SOME GOOD, BUT TO SINGLE ME OUT AS ONE OF -- YOU THINK, OR YOU KNOW? WELL, I THINK I KNOW I'VE DONE SOME GOOD. [ LAUGHS ] ALL RIGHT. BUT, YOU KNOW, I THINK THAT'S... I THINK THERE'S OTHER PEOPLE A BIT MORE DESERVING THAN ME. REALLY? I REALLY DO. YEAH. WHAT IS YOUR DEFINITION OF FREEDOM AS IT PERTAINS TO YOUR OWN LIFE? CONTINUING TO BE ABLE TO SAY WHAT I BELIEVE WITHOUT FEAR OF ANYTHING OTHER THAN SIGNIFICANT DISAGREEMENT, KNOWING THAT I STILL LIVE IN A COUNTRY WHERE I CAN SAY OR DO WHATEVER I BELIEVE, AND IT WILL BE PROTECTED. WHAT IS THE ONE THING PEOPLE WANT TO HEAR AT THE END OF THEIR LIVES? WHAT HAPPENS IN THAT MOMENT WHEN YOU CAN LITERALLY SEE THE SPIRIT GOES SOMEPLACE? Oprah: CELEBRATING THE 1-YEAR ANNIVERSARY OF THE OPENING OF THE SMITHSONIAN NATIONAL MUSEUM OF AFRICAN AMERICAN HISTORY & CULTURE. HUNDREDS OF YEARS ON THE JOURNEY, AND NOW MILLIONS HAVE MADE A PILGRIMAGE TO EXPERIENCE OUR COLLECTIVE STORY. WHAT IS THE ONE THING PEOPLE WANT TO HEAR AT THE END OF THEIR LIVES? AS WE IRISH SAY, ""YOU'RE A GOOD MAN, OR YOU'RE A GOOD WOMAN."" MM. THEY WANT TO KNOW THAT, AT THE END OF THEIR LIVES, THAT IT WAS WORTHWHILE, THAT PEOPLE WHO LOVED THEM... THAT'S WHY... BUT ANYWAY... ""THAT'S WHY"", GO AHEAD. THAT'S WHY IT'S SO IMPORTANT TO TELL YOUR MOTHER OR FATHER WHO'S DYING, IF YOU HAVE A CHANCE TO BE WITH THEM. THAT'S WHY IT'S SO IMPORTANT TO BE WITH THEM AND TELL THEM, TELL THEM ALL ABOUT HOW MUCH YOU LOVE THEM. TELL THEM HOW MUCH THEY DID FOR YOU. TALK TO THEM. AND THAT'S ONE OF THE GREAT THINGS I GOT TO DO WITH MY MOTHER AND FATHER AND MY SON, BEAU. I MEAN, I WAS THERE HOLDING HIS HAND. I MEAN, YOU KNOW, IT WAS... WHAT WAS THAT LAST MOMENT? HE LOOKED AT ME, AND HE SAID, ""DAD, I'M NOT AFRAID. I'M OKAY."" I ALWAYS WEAR THIS ROSARY, AND HE HAD IT ON AT THAT TIME, AND IT WAS AT THE VERY END, AND HIS BROTHER WAS SITTING THERE, AND THE THREE OF US WERE HOLDING HANDS, AND HE WANTED TO REASSURE US. BUT WE GOT A CHANCE TO TELL HIM, WE GOT A CHANCE TO TELL MY MOM, WE GOT A CHANCE TO TELL MY DAD... IS THAT A SACRED HOLY MOMENT? IS THAT WHAT... WHAT HAPPENS IN THAT MOMENT WHEN YOU CAN LITERALLY SEE THE SPIRIT GOES SOMEPLACE? IS THAT... YEAH, IT IS. IT IS. THAT'S WHAT THE SOUL IS. MM-HM. THAT'S... LOOK, I MEAN, THE SOUL IS ETERNITY. THE SOUL IS REDEMPTION. THE SOUL IS THE PLACE WHERE FORGIVENESS HAPPENS. THE SOUL IS WHERE YOU CONTINUE TO LIVE. I MEAN, I KNOW MY BOY IS WITH ME. MM. I KNOW MY DAUGHTER AND HIS WIFE AND HIS BROTHER AND HIS MOTHER KNOW HE'S STILL WITH US. YOU KNOW, MY NUMBER-TWO GRANDDAUGHTER, FINNEGAN, THEY HAD... I WALKED OUT. THEY WERE THERE IN THE HALLWAY WHEN THE LAST DOCTORS TOLD US WHAT TO EXPECT, AND MY FIVE GRANDCHILDREN WERE TALKING, THE THREE OLDEST. AND I HEARD FINNEGAN SAY, ""WWBD,"" AND I SAID ""HONEY, WHAT'S THAT?"" SHE SAID, ""NO, WE'RE JUST TALKING, POP,"" AND I SAID, ""WHAT'S THAT MEAN, HONEY?"" SHE SAID, ""WHAT WOULD BEAU DO?"" WHAT WOULD BEAU DO? WHAT WOULD BEAU DO? YOU KNOW, YOU HAVE TO GET TO THE POINT... I DID ""THE COLBERT SHOW"" A WHILE AGO, AND IT WAS MUCH MORE REVEALING THAN I EVER ANTICIPATED IT WAS GOING TO BE. MM-HMM. I SAW THAT. AND I CAME HOME, AND MY SON, HUNTER, SAID, ""DAD, NOW YOU'VE TALKED ABOUT BEAU."" HE SAID, ""NOW IT'S TIME WE TALK ABOUT WHAT BEAU WANTED US TO DO. NOW IT'S TIME FOR US TO TALK ABOUT WHAT BEAU WANTS, NOT ABOUT OUR LOSS, BUT ABOUT WHAT HE WANTS. WHAT WOULD HE BE DOING?"" I FIND REAL SOLACE IN THAT, AND SO DOES MY WHOLE FAMILY. SO THE WAY BEAU DIED, THE DIGNITY AND THE GRACE IN WHICH HE HELD ONTO THE LAST BREATH, ACTUALLY ENDED UP BEING A POWERFUL FORCE OF LIGHT FOR THE WAY YOU NOW GET TO LIVE. ABSOLUTELY, AND FOR MY WHOLE FAMILY. AND THE WHOLE FAMILY. THE WHOLE FAMILY. AND NOW FOR ALL OF US, 'CAUSE WE GET TO HEAR HIS STORY. WELL, YOU KNOW THERE'S A LOT OF -- AGAIN, ONLY THING I FEEL SELF-CONSCIOUS ABOUT TALKING ABOUT THIS IS THAT I DON'T WANT PEOPLE TO THINK IT'S LIKE IT'S, YOU KNOW, ONLY ME, AND THIS HAPPENED TO ME. WELL, I DON'T THINK PEOPLE THINK THAT. I DON'T THINK -- YOU KNOW WHAT PEOPLE FEEL? THEY FEEL, ""ME, TOO."" I HOPE SO... THEY FEEL, ""ME, TOO."" ...BECAUSE THERE IS HOPE. YEAH, THEY FEEL ""ME, TOO."" THERE REALLY IS HOPE. IT'S ALL CONNECTED. THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. THANK YOU. THANKS FOR HAVING ME. THANK YOU. Oprah: IN THIS WEEK'S ""SUPERSOUL BREATHING SPACE,"" IT'S ONE OF THE GREAT HONORS OF MY LIFE TO WITNESS AND SUPPORT THE CREATION OF THE SMITHSONIAN NATIONAL MUSEUM OF AFRICAN AMERICAN HISTORY & CULTURE. ONE YEAR LATER, IT STANDS AS A GLEAMING TESTAMENT TO THE COURAGE, STRUGGLE, AND TRIUMPH OF EVERY SOUL WHO SHARED IN OUR STORY. FOR MANY AMERICANS, VISITING THE MUSEUM HAS BECOME AN EMOTIONAL PILGRIMAGE. OVER 2 MILLION PEOPLE HAVE WALKED THROUGH ITS DOORS. FOR ME, THE EXPERIENCE IS MOVING AND PROFOUND. AS MAYA ANGELOU SO BEAUTIFULLY SAID, ""I COME AS ONE. I STAND AS 10,000,"" AND I'M EVER REMINDED OF THAT THROUGH THE WORK OF THIS MUSEUM. I CELEBRATE YOU ALL ON THIS ""SUPERSOUL SUNDAY.""

courage wow and you re redeem by PRON loyalty look at PRON joey and PRON be this notion that PRON could do anything because there be this notion in PRON faith PRON family that those PRON lose remain a part of PRON mm hmm but it be hard to get there it be hard to get to the place where a memory bring a smile to PRON lip before PRON bring a tear to PRON eye mm hmm i mean it be a hard thing to go through but i be lucky i always have you ve be through PRON a few time well a lot of people have be through PRON yeah in just week after win PRON first race for senator of delaware vice president biden first wife neilia and PRON month old daughter naomi be kill in a car accident PRON son hunter and beau be age and at the time PRON be injure but survive in beau biden a decorate war veteran and delaware attorney general lose PRON battle with brain cancer beau be year old so when PRON get that call and you re live in that space of disbelief that this have actually happen and PRON think that this be the bad possible thing that could ever happen to PRON but PRON have somehow be train by PRON parent by PRON belief system to look for the opportunity within every tragedy but that doesn t come easy no no PRON doesn t look i mean i still i still find PRON when i talk about PRON beau PRON son yeah who die and i sometimes find PRON say something about PRON and i can t handle PRON i start to i break down so it be not like the pain ever go away but what i do be i look at PRON grandson PRON son mm hmm i see PRON i look at PRON granddaughter i see PRON and i know he be still here i know he be still with PRON but when PRON lose naomi PRON baby daughter in the car accident with PRON first wife no preparation the shock of PRON the horror of PRON it be quite different isn t PRON when PRON have have some preparation know that beau be sick for a while or be PRON it be different and it be probably different for every person but for PRON when what happen to PRON wife and daughter happen i have i have a reason to live i have a reason by these two little boy who be in the hospital and PRON know i say at the time i probably should ve never say PRON all those year ago i say i can understand how someone could be completely thoroughly sane and commit suicide and decide that look i ve be to the top of the mountain mm hmm i m not get there again i have PRON all and there be just PRON know mm hmm so long but i have those two boy and ironically PRON end up raise PRON oprah not a joke i mean to this day PRON son hunter who be part of PRON soul if PRON walk off out of here and PRON say hey dad can i get PRON anything he d come up and give PRON a kiss he year old the smart guy i know he d give PRON a kiss dad PRON need anything PRON okay dad call PRON ask PRON PRON lose PRON mother PRON lose so there be reinforcement watch someone who PRON adore who really be part of PRON soul i mean not it be not hyperbole watch PRON go through with such grace but such awful pain die know that the likelihood that PRON be go to be able to survive be virtually nonexistent so PRON get the diagnosis of beau PRON have stage four glioblastoma of the brain nobody and so but here be the kind of kid PRON be PRON be a year old man PRON be the attorney general of the state of delaware PRON be a bronze star a decorate war veteran that didn t have to go and volunteer to go for a year PRON volunteer to go to kosovo justice department in the middle of pristine in the middle of the war PRON i mean this be a kid who be just absolutely everything about PRON be a sense of duty and obligation PRON know what strike PRON about what i read about PRON be that PRON be go to a celebration of iraqi war veteran and PRON won t even wear PRON yeah PRON wouldn t put on PRON medal PRON wouldn t wear PRON metal PRON get a call from general odierno yeah say beau this be an order captain put on PRON medal first time PRON ever put PRON on wow when PRON win the bronze PRON say dad don t tell anybody yeah don t tell people about this okay when PRON win the bronze medal PRON say don t tell anybody no PRON didn t tell PRON till PRON get home oh so but and when PRON go into service PRON say i don t want to use the name biden PRON know how PRON all have yeah i ve be in and out of iraq and afghanistan time so i get to see PRON when PRON be there on three different occasion and at first PRON would not wear PRON know PRON have PRON name right PRON get permission to have another name i think PRON use hunter PRON mother maiden name PRON know but PRON wouldn t use biden because PRON do not want to be treat any differently so how do PRON tell PRON well that be PRON stage four how do PRON hear well i be with PRON PRON be first diagnose with have have a stroke PRON come out of the military PRON be deem the fit guy in PRON battalion PRON do these test PRON have i think PRON be body fat i mean PRON be a runner and one day when PRON be run PRON start to kind of hallucinate mm and PRON worry PRON PRON didn t want to tell anybody and finally PRON tell PRON brother who be PRON lifeline hunter about PRON and PRON eventually tell PRON and then one day i m go down to washington after be home on the weekend and PRON secret service agent come in and PRON say mr vice president mr vice president the general be down the general be down refer to PRON son the attorney general PRON say he be down he be down i come run out i say what do PRON mean PRON say an ambulance be come for PRON at PRON home he be down i don t know what and so i get to PRON house be only a mile and a half away i ride in with PRON and PRON be paralyzed and PRON lose PRON ability to speak and PRON keep go ah ah what the hell be go on and PRON diagnose and PRON do the mri PRON show where the clot be in the brain and PRON be diagnose initially as a stroke that resolve PRON it be a long story don t want to bore PRON with PRON but next thing well PRON turn out PRON be the beginning of the growth of this cancer mm and so when PRON keep get bad PRON go down to md anderson in august and PRON diagnose PRON with stage four glioblastoma and hunter and ashley and jill and i and PRON all make a deal PRON would not talk about the percentage because PRON just have hope without hope PRON can t live and so that be how i begin to get knowledge about cancer i try to learn everything i possibly could about the disease and what beau would do be i would see PRON and he d say dad he d say dad look at PRON stop look sad don t look sad dad no matter what happen i m go to be all right dad you ve get to look happy you ve get to look strong for the family dad the family need PRON to look strong dad and i m not exaggerate i mean it like PRON be a remarkable young man i m not suggest other people i m just speak about PRON though PRON be always about everybody else with beau PRON know PRON dad have an expression when grow up PRON would teach PRON say joey never explain and never complain i can say give PRON word as a biden i never one single time from the moment PRON be bear ever hear beau biden complain mm not one single time PRON be a lot easy for the press to cover whether or not PRON grope a woman or whether PRON send an e mail than PRON be to determine how PRON pay for free college education PRON have no regret in the deep quiet pure moment about not actually run it be be a year since the opening of the smithsonian national museum of african american history culture now a record break number of people have visit to understand and reflect on PRON journey oprah joe biden be bear in scranton pennsylvania PRON be raise by PRON mother catherine and PRON father joseph sr who clean furnace and later sell used car the family later move to mayfield delaware where joe jr washed windows and weed garden to help pay tuition for the prestigious archmere academy a private school joe say be PRON deep desire to attend PRON would go on to the university of delaware and later law school at syracuse in joe biden be elect u s senator for the state of delaware PRON know what i be strike by i read that ever since PRON be a little boy PRON be a boy with a vision that PRON have a picture in PRON head of the kind of man that PRON want to be do PRON live up to PRON own expectation do PRON fulfill the vision or exceed the vision i by and large believe that i have end up be the man i want to be but PRON wasn t in term of accomplishment mm PRON be because people usually translate that in a PRON know as a young guy i know i want to be senator i know i want to be president i know that wasn t true what be true be i want to live up to PRON parents expectation mm and i want to be that person that meet PRON mother standard be define by PRON courage i want to be that person who be no matter what happen just get back up and keep go i want to be that person who be there and loyal to people who be loyal to PRON i want to be there i want to be that guy who know what be worth lose over do PRON know as a little boy when PRON have the vision as a little boy when PRON have this picture in PRON head what be the picture the picture PRON vary as i get old what PRON come down to be i realize everything in PRON family and in PRON faith be about the abuse of power that PRON have an obligation to challenge the abuse of power whether PRON be start off as a kid in the civil right movement and sit in and be the only white employee in the east side of the city or whether PRON be PRON know challenge the same thing when i run for election that i know be not popular but i believe and mm hmm because i believe people ultimately reward PRON for authenticity don t PRON think too this be interesting when i think about PRON because everybody know that you re get on the train every night and go home and PRON know swear into office actually in the hospital when PRON boy be there and so PRON be a dedicated father go back and forth from delaware to d c don t PRON think that actually be on that train every day be a good thing that ever happen to PRON ground mechanism absolutely because i remember live in baltimore take the train to new york or go to d c there be something about look out the window which i actually love even now drive in a car and see peoples home absolutely yeah and think about absolutely i wonder what they re eat tonight what be PRON talk about at that kitchen table what be PRON talk about at the kitchen table PRON look out on that stretch between baltimore and aberdeen yeah yeah and then see all those light on and PRON wonder what be PRON talk about for example by the way the reason i go home be i need PRON kid more than PRON need PRON i mean i really do but PRON know as a parent PRON know a child can only hold an important thought for about hour if PRON miss PRON PRON miss PRON so even though i wasn t ozzie and harriet PRON have breakfast and dinner make i d go home and lie in bed with PRON and they d talk and get up and so but the thing that be the good would happen you d be in washington and there d be a vote and you d cross constitution and the cop would stop the traffic and after a while you d be get to think well what take PRON so long PRON know but you d get on the train and you d go home and the shoe shine guy who be a good friend of mine would say joe what the hell be PRON do down there man come here yeah i mean not a joke not a joke if PRON notice if PRON ever be to delaware from the time i run i ve be refer to as joe that be all PRON don t call PRON senator even today the secret service look when PRON go hey joe come here PRON know these be constituent and they re kind of like oh what be go on here but PRON really do ground PRON man because PRON know PRON even after become vice president oh absolutely so PRON really keep PRON from ever get to the point where PRON feel self important yeah i know this sound like hyperbole but PRON really be true PRON be a gift if PRON keep PRON so connected to the people and where the people be and everybody now know how badly the medium get PRON wrong PRON must have have some inkling PRON must ve have PRON must ve not have be shock then on election night oprah if PRON be actually on the train talk to people with the people i didn t drive as vice president i take the train on the weekend i didn t go every day but i do event and a month out i come back and say we re go to lose this election a month out a month out mm and the reason i do PRON know i know i m call middle class joe in washington that be not mean as a compliment PRON mean you re not sophisticated PRON know but what be happen be the reason i believe PRON be go to lose and i think hillary would ve be a great president i really do i think PRON would ve be a great president but there two study that just come out one be annenberg school i forget the other one i apologize now but PRON look at all the word utter in a campaign how many of those word relate to an issue few word be utter related to any specific issue this last campaign than any campaign in the last presidential race now PRON be an incredibly well inform person i ll bet PRON can t find friend who can tell PRON what hillary position be on child care not generically specifically right how we re go to have free college education how it be go to be pay for all the thing that matter to those people and by the way PRON wouldn t be have this discussion but for vote let PRON put that in perspective too okay mm hmm mm hmm but in the state PRON have PRON go in i spend all PRON time in pennsylvania ohio minnesota michigan wisconsin florida virginia they re the place and this be not a criticism but i think what happen be PRON get to the point where PRON become identity politic mm hmm and PRON learn the wrong lesson from barack brilliant campaign PRON run and for example the end of the campaign i go up to a union hall to make a point and i say PRON know one of the reason hillary have to win there like union guy so one of the reason hillary have to win important because PRON need equal pay for woman place go nuts PRON know why all PRON wife be the political type PRON don t like the fact PRON wife isn t be pay where the wife who aren t be pay fairly be in corporation and law firm in silicon valley but these guys wife be high school educate kid and they re not get pay and i say and secondly look it none of PRON business who the hell PRON marry man let well enough alone period cheer they re cheering i m not joke now the press say only biden could do that that be not true PRON get to state what you re for and if PRON get suckere into not have the time in fairness to the press it be a lot easy for the press to cover whether or not PRON grope a woman or whether PRON send an e mail than PRON be to determine how PRON pay for free college education than PRON be to go in and look at what PRON position be on real tax equity i mean it just easy it easy and it be almost like PRON can t not cover PRON PRON can t not cover PRON and so if PRON look at all the coverage there be hardly any coverage about the thing that matter to the life of ordinary people do PRON feel that PRON could ve beat hillary how can PRON help PRON as a nation bring dignity back to PRON conversation PRON have no regret in the deep quiet pure moment about not actually run i have a regret that i be not president because i think there be so much opportunity mm i think america be so incredibly well position but i don t regret the decision i make because PRON be the right decision for PRON family oprah no woman or man should announce they re run for president unless PRON can answer two question yeah one do PRON truly believe they re the most qualified person for that moment i believe i be but be i prepare to be able to give PRON whole heart PRON whole soul and all PRON attention to the endeavor and i know i wasn t be PRON still broken PRON family be break i be break and i find PRON even like PRON know this be why i know there be sexism in the campaign i would be speak somewhere and someone would yell beau biden and i d say beau and i d find PRON break down and people would say wasn t PRON a good father if hillary break down PRON would ve say she play the woman card mm hmm mm hmm so PRON be so i just know i just do PRON feel PRON that could ve beat hillary i yes but PRON would ve be an incredibly difficult race and i have nothing but friendship for hillary do PRON not want to take that on because when everyone be get excited about the possibility of PRON join the race there be also obviously a lot of speculation that PRON wouldn t want to get in and take on yes the clinton factor well here be what the speculation be you re right about that mm hmm the other speculation be biden wouldn t want to be the guy deny a woman the opportunity yeah yeah PRON be real simple PRON son be die mm i couldn t tell anybody the only person i could confide in be barack he be the only one who have to know so what i wasn t able to do hillary as i say be a friend when PRON be secretary of state PRON have breakfast once a week at PRON home so PRON call PRON and PRON want i m sure PRON doesn t mind PRON say this PRON call PRON PRON want to come down and talk about the race PRON want to know whether i be go to run whether PRON be go to run or not and i sit down and i say hillary look it much less likely that i run than not run but if i do it ll be straight up it be not about PRON it be about PRON but PRON have some hope because i be tell that PRON decide to try some experimental procedure on deal with glioblastoma PRON inject PRON with a thing call anti pd and PRON inject a virus into PRON brain and there be this one faint possibility so PRON give PRON hope for how long well PRON never give up hope but PRON be PRON think in january i think in january or february there be a chance maybe PRON beat the odd mm but what i couldn t do because PRON would ve kill PRON if i announce i wasn t run because of PRON son because PRON want PRON to run yeah when do PRON tell PRON to run because that become i think PRON be go to run just because of beau wish that PRON would run every thanksgiving for year since i meet jill PRON would go to nantucket for thanksgiving when PRON be little boy mm hmm so PRON wouldn t offend PRON parent PRON parent and or PRON deceased wife parent PRON be all go this be a nuclear holiday now of PRON trudge up and so PRON be in nantucket and PRON do the christmas lighting beau be sick and PRON say dad PRON get to talk and PRON go back to the house PRON be stay in and then sit down and say PRON don t understand dad PRON want PRON to run this be hunt and beau and hunt argue this will keep the family together PRON will give PRON purpose but i just didn t have the courage to do PRON i just didn t think i could say to the public that PRON know this be i m not go to divert when PRON little grandson say pop PRON smell like daddy can i lie down with PRON mm PRON know by the way a lot of people have that but as i m president i know i couldn t now PRON didn t make any demand the whole family get together even after beau pass and say you ve get to run joe jill want PRON to run but i just in the end the decision be no because what PRON didn t have the eye of the tiger because i didn t have the eye of the tiger i know that i be still so um i know i be miss PRON so that i didn t think i could do the job that i would have to do but that be not say do i regret not be president yeah i do but i make the right decision for PRON family i believe at that time and i think that PRON have a really incredibly qualified candidate to be president so i didn t feel like i be leave the field and because i leave the field that there wasn t anybody who could PRON know run the country i didn t feel that way have there be a thought or consideration for over million people have make the trip to washington d c to experience the plight and triumph display within the smithsonian national museum of african american history culture PRON honor and celebrate this year old national treasure folk each of PRON have a responsibility PRON all know PRON you ve be teach PRON here PRON be teach PRON before PRON come here to treat people with dignity PRON demand PRON for yourself PRON demand that PRON be treat that way and all of PRON all of PRON have to do better when PRON come to build the bond of empathy that folk who aren t like PRON aren t like PRON can know PRON understand PRON life can t be live in this self referential self reinforce self righteous echo chamber PRON build for PRON online live in PRON screen encourage shallow and antiseptic relationship that make PRON easy to reduce other to stereotype how can PRON help PRON as a nation bring dignity back to PRON conversation i hear PRON speak about this by act with dignity yeah by not get down into the mosh pit right so from a big point of view social spiritual point of view where PRON be as a nation as a culture of people how bad be PRON do PRON think i don t think it let PRON tell PRON what i think the underlying cause of angst be PRON go beyond politic we re go through such a gigantic transition the consequence of digitalization supercompute capability artificial intelligence the ability to do thing that have to be do by an individual no longer have to be do can be do by a machine be scare the live hell out of people PRON dad use to have an expression joey a job be about a lot more than a paycheck it be about PRON dignity PRON respect PRON place in the community be able to look PRON kid in the eye and say it be go to be okay that be what a job be about and so now PRON have get ten of thousand of people million of people black and white look out there and hear the debate go on about globalization and the question be how do PRON adjust that globalization to meet peoples need so have there be a thought or consideration for no not yet no and i say that not yet because look i m a great respecter of fate i don t plan on run but i tell PRON what i plan on go and here be PRON problem PRON know i learn how to become one of the most popular elect official in the united states i m actually not run for president it be amazing boom thing go PRON know PRON really get good but i m ask to speak a lot in political fora and i m do PRON not as nearly as often as i m ask because every time i m ask PRON say PRON translate PRON as i m run for president but i m go to do everything i can to change the dynamic here because i think PRON can win back the house and i think PRON have a shot at the senate and PRON know the other expression PRON dad use be look don t compare PRON to the almighty compare PRON to the alternative well right now i look awful good but i can go out and do that raise money and do those thing but i m not sit here now i m as i say a great respecter of fate i m over i m thank god right now in awful good health PRON know but i don t know what the hell what thing be go to be year from now i just don t know so i promise PRON i m not do anything to organize run but i m go to go out there and continue to do what i ve do since i ve be year old mm hmm holler what be PRON do PRON think that it be about power that change people and how have PRON manage the power you ve hold what happen in that moment when PRON can literally see the spirit go someplace what be PRON do PRON think that it be about power that change people and how have PRON manage the power you ve hold well i haven t hold that much power PRON power the reason i m view as have that power be all there no power in the vice presidency it be all reflective and PRON come from the president but i think the people abuse power be that PRON in fact be seduce by the notion that PRON be so self important that PRON really matter when in fact PRON be not usually the case the only way the leader i ve observe who be the good be the one who have courage to take a chance be willing to lose on principle and two be self aware PRON understand PRON strength and PRON understand PRON weakness PRON play to PRON strength and PRON try to shore up PRON weakness and the people who don t do that be the people who be not self aware enough to know what PRON because most of the time that abuse end up be PRON downfall as well PRON see so much on the news every day rage and anger on both side what do PRON think be the source of all this rage and furor well i think it be because PRON think the system have fail PRON i think PRON look out at the congress and for the last since barack get elect the first thing republicans do be say how can PRON keep PRON from succeed at all yeah and so the congress have be sit down when PRON think of i think at when i be in the congress PRON be more divided but PRON actually know there have to be work together to get consensus to get thing do i also think PRON look out at the political system and PRON think that PRON be powerless they re powerless because PRON don t possess money and power to influence vote influence outcome what be PRON most proud of joe i m most proud of at least to this point of have serve as long as i do and democrats and republicans still accept PRON word and treat PRON as if i m honorable i be proud of be able to say that i never vote for anything that i disagree with mm when i be agnostic about PRON i d look at whatever PRON constituent want i would vote for PRON but i never vote for anything that i feel be wrong now that you ve have time to write a book and reflect on PRON life and decision do PRON think differently about that moment when president obama be give PRON the medal of freedom what strike PRON about that moment be PRON keep say i don t deserve this and i be think of course PRON deserve PRON do PRON think well PRON know differently now that i still don t think PRON don t look i think i m a i hope i m a decent man i hope i ve do some good but to single PRON out as one of PRON think or PRON know well i think i know i ve do some good laugh all right but PRON know i think that i think there other people a bit more deserving than PRON really i really do yeah what be PRON definition of freedom as PRON pertain to PRON own life continue to be able to say what i believe without fear of anything other than significant disagreement know that i still live in a country where i can say or do whatever i believe and PRON will be protect what be the one thing people want to hear at the end of PRON life what happen in that moment when PRON can literally see the spirit go someplace oprah celebrate the year anniversary of the opening of the smithsonian national museum of african american history culture hundred of year on the journey and now million have make a pilgrimage to experience PRON collective story what be the one thing people want to hear at the end of PRON life as PRON irish say you re a good man or you re a good woman mm PRON want to know that at the end of PRON life that PRON be worthwhile that people who love PRON that be why but anyway that why go ahead that be why it be so important to tell PRON mother or father who dying if PRON have a chance to be with PRON that be why it be so important to be with PRON and tell PRON tell PRON all about how much PRON love PRON tell PRON how much PRON do for PRON talk to PRON and that one of the great thing i get to do

a good purpose we've had enough we have had enough let's make it clear we have had enough as a country as a state and the good news is we don't have to be stuck in this chaos we're a democracy we vote we make the difference and all we have to do is vote and we're going to take back our country let's go do it ladies and gentlemen please welcome senator gary peters forgive us [Music] well hello flint are we ready to go out and win an election are we bringing all of our friends to the polls and are we ready not just to win but are we ready to win big well i can feel it and i'll tell you i'm just so excited to be here and i'm excited because we have president barack obama ready to come out to greet us we also have the next president of the united states joe biden ready to come out and greet us and they're both here because they love michigan and they certainly love the city of flint and we know that they love this state because they have been here time and time again but they don't just show up to visit and wave their hands and do some politic and when they show up they get the business done they have done that before and they will do it again they have shown stable leadership thoughtful leadership focused leadership man do we need that again or what i just want to talk again about where we saw them together and how it made a difference we heard dan kildy talk about it but it's personal to me when we were facing the financial crisis when when wall street agreed went wild it almost brought down the entire economy it was a mess that barack obama and joe biden walked into a mess created by the republican administration that was there before they came to our city they came to our state and we know that the auto industry was hanging in the balance with all of those jobs all that history the state that put the entire country on wheels and built the middle class all of that was in danger i remember i was a new member of congress in 2008 and i represented a district that included chrysler many of you probably know the chrysler headquarters there at ann arbor and i will never i will never forget the meeting that i had with the ceo and a number of his team when i went there and they were in big trouble and the question was whether or not there would be any assistance for the auto companies and general motors and chrysler and i remember that discussion with that ceo when he said he goes congressman let me be really clear to you the economy is in shambles money's not available and i am literally four five maybe six weeks away from liquidating chrysler not reorganizing chrysler liquidated chrysler just closing everything down and i looked around that room in the faces of the people i don't think they had heard that from the ceo that this company was going to go and disappear and i had visions of that giant parking lot at the auburn hills facility with grass growing in and no cars there families in difficult shape not just for the autos but all of the other businesses and i went back and worked with colleagues and talked to president obama and joe biden and said you've got to you've got to help we've got to do it we've got to include chrysler in it and i'll just say it to this day and i'm going to say it over and over again when people were were betting against michigan workers when donald trump said hey let detroit go bankrupt he said that when vice president pence was a member of congress and voted against the auto rescue i will just say thank god barack obama and joe biden stood with us they stood with american workers they stood with workers here in michigan they stood with workers in flint and in detroit they were there for us when we needed them and we are going to be there for them now because we need them back we are in the middle of a pandemic that has lasted a whole lot longer than any of us would like we still looking for leadership we have a president that has not acknowledged it and thought it would disappear and didn't act quickly and pitch states against each other did not show the kind of leadership that we have seen in the past but thank god joe biden has a plan thank god he will be our next president and thank god we will be able to work with him and his leadership to get through this challenge but i will say that joe biden you know he he can't do it alone he needs help he needs friends and he needs friends in the united states senate he needs a democratic majority in the united states senate we know if mitch mcconnell stays as the republican leader he will stand in the way of the progress that we need in this country we saw him do it when barack obama was president we cannot allow him to stay which is why we must win it's why we must win here in michigan i've got really good news for you we have a real shot a real shot to take the majority in the united states senate but one thing we must do is we must win here we must hold this seat and we will hold this seat as a democratic seat from michigan in the united states senate now the republicans know that they're poor pouring money into my race if any of you seen any tv commercials there are a lot of tv commercials they're pouring money in with negative nasty false ads the fact checkers say they're either faults to monster will be false or smears that's the way the republicans are trying to win mitch mcconnell and his billionaire buddies put in 20 million dollars the last three weeks and now just this weekend they're going to spend 8 million these are billionaires that think they can buy this election we all know we are all proud michiganders and we know that billionaires cannot buy an election in michigan we know that billionaires have a lot of money we get that but one of the many reasons this country is so great a billionaire still gets one vote we get one vote and we have more votes here today in flint than those billionaires but we have to work it's not over let me just wrap up by bringing a bad memory and then painting a picture of where we were going to be we all remember what happened in 2016. we all remember waking up that morning and seeing the results and i know everyone here today had this thought was there something more that i could have done the loss was only two votes of precinct is there something else i could have done could i made a few more calls could i talk to my neighbor and get those two votes out could i have had a couple friends and make sure that they get to the ballot well folks i got good news for you when you leave here today you still have time to do that work when you wake up tomorrow you can put in those two extra hours of work you can talk to those two nor neighbors you can take someone to the polls a friend of yours and when we do that over the next few days this will be the vision and i want to leave you with this vision before we hear so from some amazing people when we are waiting for the results from this election you're going to be looking at the tv the whole country is going to be watching because michigan is the center of that and when those worlds come in maybe wednesday depending on the absentees when that comes across your tv screen i know what each and every one of you will do you will jump out of your seat you will cheer because you'll say thank god michigan is a blue state thank god we have a democratic president of the united states thank god we re-elected gary peters to the senate and now have told mitch mcconnell you're in the minority we have a democratic majority in the senate and the house and collectively we will say no to the politics of division and hate that we have seen these last four years and say hello to democratic progress let's go on to victory 10 hail marys i meditate for practice channel 9 news tell me

afternoon everyone good afternoon thanks for having me and for joining today's car rally my name is dondre young and i was born and raised here in the great city of flint michigan and have been active in the community my entire life organizing and engaging people to fight for environmental justice in the fight for clean affordable water and sustainable infrastructure i grew up union strong with my family members working at these general motors and being proud members of the uaw my mother was a union representative and liaison for flint community schools my family and my community motivates me to stay committed to the fight for equity which starts at the grassroots level i always tell people that fighting for change at the grassroots level is more than just your typical nine-to-five job it's your whole life right now we desperately need a president who recognizes that this pandemic has shined a bright light on the inequities that define our system this president has used his words in this nation's highest office to stoke the flames of hate and division i don't need to tell all of you that enough is simply enough this just simply isn't going to work for us ladies and gentlemen we are just three days away from a day we will never forget this is no doubt the most important election of our lives and when november 4th rolls around we need to know that we left it all on the table that we did everything we could to elect the leaders we know we deserve we're at a cross crossroads right now and meeting this moment means exercising your right to vote it means telling your friends and family to vote for those of you who have yet to vote you can go to iowavote.com again that is iwillvote.com to make your plan today if you care about health care and the water you drink you need to vote for joe biden the stakes are too high to sit this one out joe biden knows that change starts at the grassroots level he knows that the best laws and policies demand a patient attentive ear to the ground he will listen he cares about us he helped save the auto industry which made a huge difference for thousands in flint and he will be more than a nine-to-five president because he knows that's what it takes to right the ship here in flint we are no strangers to what it takes or rather what it means to suffer a public health crisis as our country and the world feels the weight of the covent 19 pandemic we're all looking for hope and leadership to move us forward i remember a time where we sought that same unique brand of hope when we were going in the wrong direction we used our power made history and elected the first black president of the united states i'm so honored to introduce a man and president who embodies that hope who forged a bright path forward but one little housekeeping item before i welcome him to the stage we're asking that you please refrain from hunking your horns during president obama and vice president biden's remarks flint please join me in

a plan to vote because we need everybody not just some people we got we got to get everybody out there i love you too okay that's it put that mask back on listen michigan joel biden is my brother i love this i love joe biden and he will be a great president now i'll admit 12 years ago when i when i asked him to be the nominee for vice president with me when i was running i i didn't know joe that well we had served together in the senate but he and i came from different places part of different generations but i quickly came to admire joe as a man who learned early on to treat everybody he meets with dignity and with respect living by the words his mom taught him no one's better than you joe but you're no better than anybody else and and that sense of of decency and empathy the belief in in hard work and family and faith the belief that everybody counts that's who joe is and that's who he'll be as president i i can tell you the presidency doesn't change who you are it shows who you are it reveals who you are and for eight years joe was the last one in the room whenever i faced a big decision and he made me a better president he's got the character and the experience to make us a better country and he and kamala are going to be in the fight not for themselves but for every single one of us and we sure can't say that about the president we've got right now you know i i i i've said this before i never thought donald trump would embrace my vision i i understood he didn't agree with my policies but i did hope for the country's sake that he might show some interest in the job he might take the job seriously he never has he hasn't shown any interest in doing the work or helping anybody but himself and his friends or treating the presidency as anything more than a reality show to give him the attention that he craves but unfortunately the rest of us have to live with the consequences almost two hundred and thirty thousand americans are dead more than a hundred thousand small businesses have closed almost three hundred three hundred 000 jobs are gone in michigan alone america just had its single worst week of new covet cases and what's his closing argument here we are the worst week this week i mean we've been going through this now for months the federal government has had an opportunity to respond four months and his closing argument this week is that the press and people are too focused on covid cohen kovetkoviti's complaining he's he's jealous of kovitz media coverage and now he's accusing doctors of profiting off this pandemic think about that he said this just yesterday said doctors are overblowing it because they're going to make money off it doctors he cannot fathom he does not understand the notion that somebody would risk their life to save others without trying to make a buck his chief of staff says we're not going to control the pandemic that's a quote said it last week we are not going to control the pandemic we noticed mr chief of staff we understand you're not going to control the pandemic but you know who will joe biden will when we elect him president of the united states you remember when republicans were saying let detroit go bankrupt you remember that now they might as well be saying let america get coveted because that's how they're asking if trump were focused on kovit from the beginning cases wouldn't be reaching new record highs across the country some of the places he owes rallies have even seen new spikes after he leaves town there was just a study by stanford university that just came out showing thousands of people are likely to have gotten sick because of these rallies he's holding what is his obsession by the way with crowd size you notice that he he's always work this is the one measure he has of success he's still worrying about his inauguration crowd being smaller than mine it really bugs him he talked about he's still talking about that does he have nothing better to worry about did no one come to his birthday party when he was a kid was he traumatized what what what's with crowds well you know i've i've had crowds before you know have you had quite a few but but you know when a country's going through a pandemic that's not what you're supposed to be worrying about and that's the difference between joe biden and trump right there trump cares about feeding his ego joe cares about keeping you and your family safe and he's less interested in feeding his ego with having big crowds then he is making sure he's not going around making more and more people sick that's what you should expect from a president you can expect something different from a reality tv star but from a president you want them to put you above their own ego look here's the truth michigan this pandemic would have been challenging for any president but this idea that somehow this white house has done anything but completely screw this up is nonsense canada identified its first case the same week that the u.s did right just a few miles up right it's not close i may not be pointing north but canada is pretty close by our mortality rate in the united states is two and a half times higher than canada think about that if we had the same percentage of folks dying in canada as we do here nearly 90 000 americans would have died instead of 230 000 americans if we had handled this pandemic like canada did a hundred and forty thousand of our fellow americans might still be alive today think about that think about that and yet despite that last week when trump was asked if he'd do anything different he said not much really not much can't think of anything i listen i i understand the president was was anxious to downplay because he wanted to get credit for the economy that he inherited and zero blame for the pandemic he ignored but it doesn't work that way the job doesn't work that way tweeting at the tv doesn't fix things making stuff up doesn't make people's lives better you've got to have a plan you've got to put in the work and along with the experience to get things done joe biden has concrete plans and policies that will turn our vision of a better fairer stronger country into reality joe's not going to screw up testing joe's not going to call scientists idiots he's not going to host super spreader events around the country what joe will do is get this pandemic under control with a plan to make testing free and widely available to get a vaccine every american costs free and make sure our front line heroes never have to ask other countries for the equipment that they need that's what joe biden will do joe's plan will guarantee paid sick leave for workers and parents affected by the pandemic he'll make sure that small businesses in every community not just some not just big corporations but small businesses that hold our communities together and employ millions of americans can reopen safely donald trump likes to claim he built this economy america created 1.5 million more jobs in the last three years of the obama biden administration than in his first three years and that was before he could blame the pandemic joe biden and i with the help of a democratic congress rescued the auto industry gary peters was there he told us to bet on michigan and we did and manufacturing in michigan grew by 15 percent over our last four years trump promised he'd make michigan the manufacturing hub of the world again it's up one percent under his first four years 15 under obama biden one percent under him that's michigan right here we handed him the longest streak of job growth in american history but the economic damage he inflicted by botching the pandemic response means he'll be the only president since herbert hoover to actually lose jobs herbert hoover that's a long time ago joe biden and gary peters know that the key to a strong economy isn't cutting more taxes for billionaires it's lifting up the prospects for working americans and joe's got a plan to create one million new auto related jobs by accelerating electric vehicle production he's got a plan to create 10 million good clean energy jobs and fight climate change and secure environmental justice something that's relevant to flint michigan you know something about that he'll and he'll pay for his plans by rolling back trump's tax cuts for billionaires and and this is important joe sees this moment not to get back to where we were but to build on the progress we made together and finally make long overdue changes so that our economy actually makes life a little easier for everybody for the waitress trying to raise a kid on her own for the student figuring out how to pay for next semester's classes or the shift worker always on the edge of getting laid off or the cancer survivor who's worried that her pre-existing conditions protections will be taken away let's talk about health care for a second let's talk about health care for a second republicans love to say right before an election that they'll protect your pre-existing conditions that's what they say well you know what joe and i actually protected them 10 years ago with the affordable care act and since we did so with no help from republicans no votes from republicans republicans have tried to repeal or undermine the aca more than 60 times for 60 times they've tried to take people's health care away and and when asked why are you why are you doing that why are you being so mean you don't think these people should have health care that say no no no we've got a new plan it's going to be beautiful it's going to be terrific except it's been 10 years now and they still don't have a plan they're trying to bamboozle you instead of actually coming up with a plan they've attacked the aca at every turn they've they've driven up costs they've driven up the number of uninsured now they're trying to get the supreme court to take your health care away in the middle of a pandemic in the mid right at the time when people need health care they they they've signed on to a case right now in the supreme court where they're trying to take insurance away from folks who need it with nothing but empty promises to take its place and now mitch mcconnell is pouring millions of outside super pac dollars into michigan to try to beat gary peters because that's part of their agenda michigan here is the truth joel and kamala and gary will protect your health care they will expand medicare they will make insurance more affordable for everybody and the reason you know that's true is because they were there when we did it the first time and here's another thing with joe and kamal at the helm this is a big benefit michelle and i were talking about this over dinner the other day you're not gonna have to think about them every day you're not gonna have to argue with your family about them every day it won't be so exhausting you'll be able to get on with your lives knowing that the president is not going to suggest we inject bleach as a possible cure of covet you won't have to find out you won't you you won't wake up in the morning and kind of open your phone oh newsflash uh the president retweeted conspiracy theories that the navy seals didn't actually kill bin laden you're not gonna have a president who goes out of his way to insult people just because they don't support him this is not normal behavior people we would not tolerate it from a teacher or a coach or a co-worker or a family member if if a neighbor was acting like this you'd stay away from that neighbor why would we accept it from the president of the united states and you know what there are consequences to this action there are consequences to his actions it's not just a joke it's not funny those actions embolden other people to be mean and divisive and racist and a phrase is the fabric of all of our lives and it affects how our children see the world and how they treat each other it affects the way our families get along it affects the way the world sees america that's why joe talks about the soul of america that's why he he talks about decency and and kindness and responsibility and hard work that more than anything is what separates joe biden from his opponent he actually cares about every american he does not have a mean-spirited bone in his body i have seen him spend spend time with with people that strangers that he doesn't know when he hears about they're going through a hardship he talks about what he's gone through when he sees a kid his eyes light up because because he thinks about his own kids and grandkids he joe biden tries to live the values we cherish honesty hard work kindness humility responsibility helping somebody else out that used to be the definition of of manliness not strutting and showing off acting important bullying people used to be being a man meant taking care of your other people not going around bragging but but just doing the work not looking for credit trying to live right passing on those values to your kids looking out for a community carrying your weight giving up a little bit of what what you might have to help somebody who has a real need when you elect joe that's what you'll see reflected from the white house and those shouldn't be republican or democratic values they didn't used to be they're what we grew up learning from our parents and from our grandparents and they're the values we still try to teach our kids and they're not white or black or hispanic or asian or native american values they're american values and we've got to reclaim them right now but to reclaim them we're gonna have to turn out like never before if we're going to reclaim those values we need to leave no doubt we can't afford to be complacent not this time not in this election we got a little complacent the last election and listen i understand why americans get frustrated and sometimes think dumb government's not going to make a difference voting is not going to make a difference i understand that government's not perfect the people in government are not perfect even when it's working government's not going to solve every problem but we can make things better a president can't by himself solve every challenge facing the economy here in flint or michigan but if we elect people like gary peters and dan kildy and we get a house and a senate joined with a white house that are more focused on working people and getting you the help that you need they will make a difference and some folks will get jobs that wouldn't otherwise have jobs and some folks will have health care that wouldn't otherwise have health care a president by himself can't eliminate all racial bias in our criminal justice system but if we elect district attorneys and states attorneys and sheriffs focused on equality and justice and we once again have a justice department and a civil rights division in the justice department that cares about these issues we can make things better and that's what voting's about not making things perfect but making things better it puts us on a track so that generations from now we can look back and say you know what right about then things start getting better again the fact that you don't get 100 of what you want right away that's not a good reason to vote you just got to keep at it you know typically just over 50 of us vote who are eligible think about that almost half of the people in most elections who are eligible to vote don't vote imagine if 60 of us voted imagine if 70 of us voted imagine january 20th when we swear in a president and vice president who's got a plan to get us out of this mess who care about folks like you who've been in your shoes who know what it's like to struggle who know what it's like to have to work hard who are thinking about working americans and have a plan to help you start getting ahead imagine what it's going to be like to have a president and a vice president who believe in science and who have a plan to protect this planet for our children and who believe in racial equality and are sending a clear signal that we're all in this together and are doing the work to bring us closer so that we have an america where no matter what we look like where we come from who we love or how much money we've got we we can make it and we have a place and we're treated with dignity and respect michigan that's what's possible and i'm asking you to remember that it's possible i want you to remember what this country can be but you can't just imagine a better future you can't just wish for it you've got to fight for it you got to fight for it we got to out hustle the other side we got to vote up and down the ticket like never before right here in michigan and all across the country we've got to leave no doubt about who we are and what this country stands for and if we do we will send gary peters back to the senate and we will elect a man who loves this country and who cares about you and who will fight for every single one of us and will look out not just for folks who support him but even the folks who don't my friend the next president of the united states of america joe biden joe biden [Music] hulk if you're fired hulk if you are ready to go [Music] [Music] thank you thank you thank you kind of reminds you how good it can be listening to him doesn't it as my mother would say about barack god love him he's a good man folks it's good to be back with friends mary neely governor whitmer lieutenant governor gilchrist debbie stabenow my good buddy gary peters who you are going to send back to the united states senate because i'm going to need him we can always count on him to be your senator for you and your family and my good friend congressman dan kildee who we need to send back the house dan's a good man a good man and of course i wish we could figure out how to send back a guy who uh we used to have an expression in the up in scranton we'd say when someone wasn't somebody else's equals they wasn't a patch on his jeans i tell you what mr president you're still driving him crazy because he knows he wasn't a patch on your jeans i tell you what barack obama it's great to be with the president again it reminds me of what we can be when you have a president of character a president respected around the world a president our kids looked up to and did look up to i want to say something we don't say often enough and i mean this from the bottom of my heart barack obama was a great president of the united states of america and i want to make sure we say it here today mr president thank you thank you thank you went through eight years without one single trace of scandal not one single trace of scandal it's gonna be nice to return to that flint three days three days we can put an end to this presidency we have now that has divided the nation three days we can put an end to a presidency that has failed to protect this nation three days we can put an end to this presidency that has fanned the flames of hate all across this nation and made us a laughing stock around the world millions of americans have already voted millions more are voting today tomorrow and god willing all the way through to the close of the polls on tuesday and my message is simple the power to change the country is not figuratively it's literally in your hands i don't care how hard donald trump tries there's nothing let me say it again there's nothing that he can do to stop the people of this nation from voting in overwhelming numbers and taking back this democracy and when americans vote no matter how many threats he makes america will be heard when america's heard i believe the message is going to be loud and it's going to be clear it's time for donald trump to pack his bags and go home we're done with the chaos the tweets the anger the hate the failure the refusal to take any responsibility we've got a lot of work to do we've got a lot of work to do and if i'm elected your president we're going to do it we're going to act and we're going to need your help in doing it as well we're going to act to get covert under control on day one of my presidency i'll put an action a plan i've been taking about talking about for months already laid out a national mandate mask wearing social distancing testing tracing all things as president obama just said it should have been could have been put in place months and months ago a plan for full and fair and free i might add distribution of therapeutics and vaccines when we get one imagine where we'd be if we had a president of war mask instead of mocking it i can tell you this we wouldn't have nine million confirmed cases of covet in this nation over 230 000 deaths we wouldn't be seeing a new record of cases we're seeing right now ninety thousand cases today yesterday ninety thousand new cases we wouldn't be faith by the way five hundred thousand it's just the past week this guy tells us it's going away i don't think he'll make it go away if he goes away folks we wouldn't be facing another 200 000 deaths in the next few months this president knew in january the virus was deadly and trying to improve his image he wanted have tried to talk to bob woodr he thought he could change his mind but what he did he let it be known all the way back in january he knew how dangerous this pandemic was and he hid it from the american people he knew it was worse than the flu but he lied to the american people he knew it wasn't going to disappear but he kept telling us a miracle is coming and yesterday he had the gall to suggest that american doctors people are putting their lives on the line on the front lines to save other lives along with nurses and so many others he suggested falsely that they're inflating the number of covades to make more money what in the hell is wrong with this man excuse my language but think about it it's perverted he may believe it because he doesn't do anything for other than for money the people of this nation have suffered and sacrificed for nine months none more so than the doctors on the front lines and health care workers and this president is questioning their character their integrity their commitment to their fellow americans it's more than offensive it's a disgrace especially coming from a president who has waived the white flag of surrender to this virus our front-line health workers they've given their all to beat the virus we have a president who's just given up i will never raise the white flag of surrender we're going to beat this virus we're going to get it under control and the first step to doing that is beating donald trump look donald trump keeps telling us what a great job he's done as president oh man well did you know president obama and i as he pointed out created more jobs in the last three years of our administration than he did in the first three years before the pandemic how about this or did you know donald trump's going to be the first president in 90 years to go to finish his term with fewer jobs under his leadership than when he started look that's a lot of presidents that's a lot of crises but only donald trump is going to have fewer jobs at the end of his presidency than when he started you see i and barack understands something donald trump doesn't wall street didn't build this country you did working people built this country and unions built the middle class he's done nothing of wage war on american labor i see the uaw sign out there first outfit ever endorsed me in 19 when i was a 29 year old kid god love you look we have a different view we believe we should be rewarding work not wealth in this country under my plan if you make less than four hundred thousand dollars a year you're not going to pay a penny in additional taxes but the wealthiest people the biggest corporations 91 of the fortune 500 companies paid zero in federal income tax last year they're going to start to pay their fair share the super wealth are going to pay the same rate they played at the beginning of george bush's administration and corporations are going to start to pay their fair share why should a firefighter an educator a nurse pay a higher tax rate than someone making literally a billion dollars or should you why should you pay more in taxes then donald trump he paid 750 dollars in taxes the one year we know of he's yet to release i've released 22 years of my tax returns you can go online and look he hasn't released one he talks about corruption what is he hiding he owes 41 million bucks out there who's he owed to if you notice he's the only president i know of that a secret bank account in china paid 50 times more taxes in beijing than he's paid in the united states and this guy talks about corruption look we're also going to act to protect health care trump of the republicans just jammed through a supreme court nominee for one overwhelming reason as barack said the president said women they've been trying over 50 shots to take out obamacare destroy the affordable care act but they're going to be in court i believe it's seven days after the election win or lose they're going to be in court if they get their way hundred million americans will lose protections for praises and conditions including more than four million michiganders donald trump thinks healthcare is a privilege barack and i think it's a right for people that bad at healthcare we're not only gonna store obamacare we're gonna build on we're gonna keep your private insurance if you like it and you can choose a medical a medicare-like public option if you don't we're going to increase subsidies to lower your premiums and deductibles out of pocket spending reduce prescription drug costs by 60 percent look we're going to make sure you keep the protections for people of pre-existing conditions meanwhile donald trump laid out what he's going to do in his second term if he's elected to social security the actuary at the social security administration says if he gets that plan passed it will quote bankrupt social security by 2023 something millions of americans live on paid for their whole life when i said back six years ago as debbie will tell you when i said the republicans are going to try to eliminate medicare everybody said no that's crazy first thing paul ryan the republicans in the congress did was try to cut billions of dollars out of medicare these guys mean what they say i'm going to protect social security medicare and medicaid because there's a lifeline for so many hard-working folks but folks i have to admit to you it's kind of personal with me there's nothing worse that this president has done in my view than the way he speaks about our women and men in uniform and those who've given their lives they call them losers and suckers my son beau was a major in the united states army gave up the attorney general's job and petitioned to be able to go with his unit to iraq for one solid year after as a u.s attorney being in kosovo i might add i'm going to be a typical dad he's the only foreigner in kosovo that has a 12-foot memorial dedicated to him the major highway they built the bo biden highway because of his commitment my son came home with a bronze star that could speak of his service but like so many others before he passed away but less what he wasn't a sucker he wasn't a loser or any of you served you're patriots and just like all of your sons and daughters your parents and grandparents who served the president likes to portray himself i love this likes to portray himself as a tough guy when you're in high school wouldn't you have liked to take the shot anyway it's a different story but anyway a macho man but when's the last time you read about saul heard about a present united states literally being laughed at by world leaders when he spoke to the united nations laughed at out loud when's the last time you saw president united states being openly mocked by the leaders of nato at a nato conference and can you believe we have a president who acts like vladimir putin's puppy putin put bounties on the heads of american soldiers serving in iraq and trump was too scared to challenge him talked to him six times has never mentioned it trump's not strong he's weak he commands little respect they're in the international stage this the president who not only doesn't understand sacrifice you don't understand courage physical courage it takes to serve in uniform in a war zone maybe that's why six generals and admirals who work for him left his administration and said he was unfit to command be commander-in-chief when's the last time any president has had that happen tough guy that's why george special operations commander general stanley mcchrystal that's why head of the navy seals oversaw the raid of bin laden admiral bill craven and 22 other four stars have endorsed me say they support me to be their next commander-in-chief because like obama and bush and before him they know we respect them we'll support them i've been in and out of war zones as senator and vice president over 35 times i tell you what these folks we have only one percent of the country is in the military we owe them they're the backbone they're the sinew they're the heart of who we are that's why we have to support our military and get rid of trump folks you know i want to tell you something think about this this is a guy who says there's no such thing as climate change he calls it a hoax i see it as jobs health and safety the impacts on climate are too often fall disproportionately on poor communities and communities of color we're going to make sure communities benefit from the hundreds of billions of federal investment and infrastructure and climate change we're going to do as a consequence of the change in the structure we're going to create local jobs to rebuild roads fill sidewall cracks install broadband create spaces to live work and play safely to modernize infrastructure so you can turn on the faucet and clean water comes out and when that happened in flint will never happen again anywhere in america we can't and must do this donald trump has rolled back more than 100 environmental protection laws many enacted under barack and me it also holds polluted i'll call polluters accountable with the most ambitious environmental justice agenda ever folks we're an act to deliver on racial justice in america protesting is not burning or looting violence has cannot be tolerated and it won't but these protesters is a cry for justice the names of george florida taylor jacob blake will not soon be forgotten they're going to inspire a new wave of justice in america america has had their eyes opened up they're ready look i believe this country has to come together i know when i announced well over a year ago when i said i wanted to unite the country everybody said that's naive that was a long time ago you did it before biden but you can't do it again well we can and we must we have no choice that's how democracies work i'm running as a proud democrat but i will govern as an american president i'll work as hard for those who don't support me as those who do that's the job of a president it's a duty to care a duty to care for everyone so please vote you still have an absentee ballot get it to a drop box as soon as you can you could also safely verdo early until monday afternoon or you can vote election day

such enormous progress because the american people have seen what the other looks like they've gotten a glimpse of the abyss i really mean it they're ready they're ready to change so much i'll never forget what president kennedy said when he promised to send us to the moon he used the phrase that has guided me he said we're doing it because quote we refuse to postpone well i refuse to postpone the incredible opportunities to the united states of america for the american people there is nothing beyond our capacity there is no limit to america's future the only thing that can tear america apart is america itself and that's exactly what donald trump has been doing from the beginning of this campaign dividing america pitting americans against one another based on race gender ethnicity national origin it's wrong it's un-american that's not who we are folks everybody knows who donald trump is let's keep showing though who we are we choose hope over fear we choose unity over division we choose science over fiction and yes we choose truth over lies my fellow americans it's time for us to stand back and stand up and take back our democracy we can do this we're so much better than we've been we can be what we are at our best the united states of america god bless you all and may god protect our troops thank you thank you thank you i'm wondering [Music] i'm [Music] here i am

live by the word PRON mom teach PRON no one be well than PRON joe but PRON be no well than anybody else and and that sense of of decency and empathy the belief in in hard work and family and faith the belief that everybody count that be who joe be and that be who PRON will be as president i i can tell PRON the presidency do not change who PRON be PRON show who PRON be PRON reveal who PRON be and for eight year joe be the last one in the room whenever i face a big decision and PRON make PRON a well president PRON be get the character and the experience to make PRON a well country and PRON and kamala be go to be in the fight not for PRON but for every single one of PRON and PRON sure can not say that about the president PRON have get right now PRON know i i i PRON have say this before i never think donald trump would embrace PRON vision i i understand PRON do not agree with PRON policy but i do hope for the country sake that PRON may show some interest in the job PRON may take the job seriously PRON never have PRON have not show any interest in do the work or help anybody but PRON and PRON friend or treat the presidency as anything more than a reality show to give PRON the attention that PRON crave but unfortunately the rest of PRON have to live with the consequence almost two hundred and thirty thousand americans be dead more than a hundred thousand small business have close almost three hundred three hundred job be go in michigan alone america just have PRON single bad week of new covet case and what be PRON closing argument here PRON be the bad week this week i mean PRON have be go through this now for month the federal government have have an opportunity to respond four month and PRON closing argument this week be that the press and people be too focused on covid cohen kovetkoviti complaining PRON be PRON be jealous of kovitz medium coverage and now PRON be accuse doctor of profit off this pandemic think about that PRON say this just yesterday say doctor be overblowe PRON because PRON be go to make money off PRON doctor PRON can not fathom PRON do not understand the notion that somebody would risk PRON life to save other without try to make a buck PRON chief of staff say PRON be not go to control the pandemic that be a quote say PRON last week PRON be not go to control the pandemic PRON notice mr chief of staff PRON understand PRON be not go to control the pandemic but PRON know who will joe biden will when PRON elect PRON president of the united states PRON remember when republicans be say let detroit go bankrupt PRON remember that now PRON may as well be say let america get coveted because that be how PRON be ask if trump be focus on kovit from the begin case would not be reach new record high across the country some of the place PRON owe rally have even see new spike after PRON leave town there be just a study by stanford university that just come out show thousand of people be likely to have get sick because of these rally PRON be hold what be PRON obsession by the way with crowd size PRON notice that PRON PRON be always work this be the one measure PRON have of success PRON be still worry about PRON inauguration crowd be small than PRON PRON really bug PRON PRON talk about PRON be still talk about that do PRON have nothing well to worry about do no one come to PRON birthday party when PRON be a kid be PRON traumatize what what what be with crowd well PRON know PRON have PRON have have crowd before PRON know have PRON have quite a few but but PRON know when a country be go through a pandemic that be not what PRON be suppose to be worry about and that be the difference between joe biden and trump right there trump care about feed PRON ego joe care about keep PRON and PRON family safe and PRON be less interested in feed PRON ego with have big crowd then PRON be make sure PRON be not go around make more and more people sick that be what PRON should expect from a president PRON can expect something different from a reality tv star but from a president PRON want PRON to put PRON above PRON own ego look here be the truth michigan this pandemic would have be challenge for any president but this idea that somehow this white house have do anything but completely screw this up be nonsense canada identify PRON first case the same week that the u s do right just a few mile up right PRON be not close i may not be point north but canada be pretty close by PRON mortality rate in the united states be two and a half time high than canada think about that if PRON have the same percentage of folk die in canada as PRON do here nearly americans would have die instead of americans if PRON have handle this pandemic like canada do a hundred and forty thousand of PRON fellow americans may still be alive today think about that think about that and yet despite that last week when trump be ask if PRON would do anything different PRON say not much really not much can not think of anything i listen i i understand the president be be anxious to downplay because PRON want to get credit for the economy that PRON inherit and zero blame for the pandemic PRON ignore but PRON do not work that way the job do not work that way tweet at the tv do not fix thing make stuff up do not make people life well PRON have get to have a plan PRON have get to put in the work and along with the experience to get thing do joe biden have concrete plan and policy that will turn PRON vision of a better fair strong country into reality joe be not go to screw up test joe not go to call scientist idiot PRON be not go to host super spreader event around the country what joe will do be get this pandemic under control with a plan to make testing free and widely available to get a vaccine every american cost free and make sure PRON front line hero never have to ask other country for the equipment that PRON need that be what joe biden will do joe plan will guarantee pay sick leave for worker and parent affect by the pandemic PRON will make sure that small business in every community not just some not just big corporation but small business that hold PRON community together and employ million of americans can reopen safely donald trump like to claim PRON build this economy america create million more job in the last three year of the obama biden administration than in PRON first three year and that be before PRON could blame the pandemic joe biden and i with the help of a democratic congress rescue the auto industry gary peters be there PRON tell PRON to bet on michigan and PRON do and manufacture in michigan grow by percent over PRON last four year trump promise PRON would make michigan the manufacturing hub of the world again PRON be up one percent under PRON first four year under obama biden one percent under PRON that be michigan right here PRON hand PRON the long streak of job growth in american history but the economic damage PRON inflict by botch the pandemic response mean PRON will be the only president since herbert hoover to actually lose job herbert hoover that be a long time ago joe biden and gary peters know that the key to a strong economy be not cut more taxis for billionaire PRON be lift up the prospect for work americans and joe get a plan to create one million new auto relate job by accelerate electric vehicle production PRON be get a plan to create million good clean energy job and fight climate change and secure environmental justice something that be relevant to flint michigan PRON know something about that PRON will and PRON will pay for PRON plan by roll back trump tax cut for billionaire and and this be important joe see this moment not to get back to where PRON be but to build on the progress PRON make together and finally make long overdue change so that PRON economy actually make life a little easy for everybody for the waitress try to raise a kid on PRON own for the student figure out how to pay for next semester class or the shift worker always on the edge of get lay off or the cancer survivor who be worried that PRON pre existing condition protection will be take away let PRON talk about health care for a second let PRON talk about health care for a second republicans love to say right before an election that PRON will protect PRON pre existing condition that be what PRON say well PRON know what joe and i actually protect PRON year ago with the affordable care act and since PRON do so with no help from republicans no vote from republicans republicans have try to repeal or undermine the aca more than time for time PRON

pandemic in the mid right at the time when people need health care PRON PRON PRON have sign on to a case right now in the supreme court where PRON be try to take insurance away from folk who need PRON with nothing but empty promise to take PRON place and now mitch mcconnell be pour million of outside super pac dollar into michigan to try to beat gary peters because that be part of PRON agenda michigan here be the truth joel and kamala and gary will protect PRON health care PRON will expand medicare PRON will make insurance more affordable for everybody and the reason PRON know that be true be because PRON be there when PRON do PRON the first time and here be another thing with joe and kamal at the helm this be a big benefit michelle and i be talk about this over dinner the other day PRON be not go to have to think about PRON every day PRON be not go to have to argue with PRON family about PRON every day PRON will not be so exhausting PRON will be able to get on with PRON life know that the president be not go to suggest PRON inject bleach as a possible cure of covet PRON will not have to find out PRON will not PRON PRON will not wake up in the morning and kind of open PRON phone oh newsflash uh the president retweete conspiracy theory that the navy seal do not actually kill bin laden PRON be not go to have a president who go out of PRON way to insult people just because PRON do not support PRON this be not normal behavior people PRON would not tolerate PRON from a teacher or a coach or a co worker or a family member if if a neighbor be act like this PRON would stay away from that neighbor why would PRON accept PRON from the president of the united states and PRON know what there be consequence to this action there be consequence to PRON action PRON be not just a joke PRON be not funny those action embolden other people to be mean and divisive and racist and a phrase be the fabric of all of PRON life and PRON affect how PRON child see the world and how PRON treat each other PRON affect the way PRON family get along PRON affect the way the world see america that be why joe talk about the soul of america that be why PRON PRON talk about decency and and kindness and responsibility and hard work that more than anything be what separate joe biden from PRON opponent PRON actually care about every american PRON do not have a mean spirited bone in PRON body i have see PRON spend spend time with with people that stranger that PRON do not know when PRON hear about PRON be go through a hardship PRON talk about what PRON be go through when PRON see a kid PRON eye light up because because PRON think about PRON own kid and grandkids PRON joe biden try to live the value PRON cherish honesty hard work kindness humility responsibility help somebody else out that use to be the definition of of manliness not strut and show off act important bully people use to be be a man mean take care of PRON other people not go around bragging but but just do the work not look for credit try to live right passing on those value to PRON kid look out for a community carry PRON weight give up a little bit of what what PRON may have to help somebody who have a real need when PRON elect joe that be what PRON will see reflect from the white house and those should not be republican or democratic value PRON do not use to be PRON be what PRON grow up learn from PRON parent and from PRON grandparent and PRON be the value PRON still try to teach PRON kid and PRON be not white or black or hispanic or asian or native american value PRON be american value and PRON have get to reclaim PRON right now but to reclaim PRON PRON be go to have to turn out like never before if PRON be go to reclaim those value PRON need to leave no doubt PRON can not afford to be complacent not this time not in this election PRON get a little complacent the last election and listen i understand why americans get frustrated and sometimes think dumb government be not go to make a difference voting be not go to make a difference i understand that government be not perfect the people in government be not perfect even when PRON be work government be not go to solve every problem but PRON can make thing well a president can not by PRON solve every challenge face the economy here in flint or michigan but if PRON elect people like gary peters and dan kildy and PRON get a house and a senate join with a white house that be more focused on work people and get PRON the help that PRON need PRON will make a difference and some folk will get job that would not otherwise have job and some folk will have health care that would not otherwise have health care a president by PRON can not eliminate all racial bias in PRON criminal justice system but if PRON elect district attorney and state attorney and sheriff focus on equality and justice and PRON once again have a justice department and a civil right division in the justice department that care about these issue PRON can make thing better and that be what voting be about not make thing perfect but make thing well PRON put PRON on a track so that generation from now PRON can look back and say PRON know what right about then thing start get well again the fact that PRON do not get of what PRON want right away that be not a good reason to vote PRON just get to keep at PRON PRON know typically just over of us vote who be eligible think about that almost half of the people in most election who be eligible to vote do not vote imagine if of PRON vote imagine if of PRON vote imagine january th when PRON swear in a president and vice president who be get a plan to get PRON out of this mess who care about folk like PRON who have be in PRON shoe who know what PRON be like to struggle who know what PRON be like to have to work hard who be think about work americans and have a plan to help PRON start get ahead imagine what PRON be go to be like to have a president and a vice president who believe in science and who have a plan to protect this planet for PRON child and who believe in racial equality and be send a clear signal that PRON be all in this together and be do the work to bring PRON closer so that PRON have an america where no matter what PRON look like where PRON come from who PRON love or how much money PRON have get PRON PRON can make PRON and PRON have a place and PRON be

PRON be more than offensive PRON be a disgrace especially come from a president who have waive the white flag of surrender to this virus PRON front line health worker PRON have give PRON all to beat the virus PRON have a president who be just give up i will never raise the white flag of surrender PRON be go to beat this virus PRON be go to get PRON under control and the first step to do that be beat donald trump look donald trump keep tell PRON what a great job PRON be do as president oh man well do PRON know president obama and i as PRON point out create more job in the last three year of PRON administration than PRON do in the first three year before the pandemic how about this or do PRON know donald trump be go to be the first president in year to go to finish PRON term with few job under PRON leadership than when PRON start look that be a lot of president that be a lot of crisis but only donald trump be go to have few job at the end of PRON presidency than when PRON start PRON see i and barack understand something donald trump do not wall street do not build this country PRON do work people build this country and union build the middle class PRON be do nothing of wage war on american labor i see the uaw sign out there first outfit ever endorse PRON in when i be a year old kid god love PRON look PRON have a different view PRON believe PRON should be reward work not wealth in this country under PRON plan if PRON make less than four hundred thousand dollar a year PRON be not go to pay a penny in additional taxis but the wealthy people the big corporation of the fortune company pay zero in federal income tax last year PRON be go to start to pay PRON fair share the super wealth be go to pay the same rate PRON play at the beginning of george bush administration and corporation be go to start to pay PRON fair share why should a firefighter an educator a nurse pay a high tax rate than someone make literally a billion dollar or should PRON why should PRON pay more in taxis then donald trump PRON pay dollar in taxis the one year PRON know of PRON be yet to release PRON have release year of PRON tax return PRON can go online and look PRON have not release one PRON talk about corruption what be PRON hide PRON owe million buck out there who be PRON owe to if PRON notice PRON be the only president i know of that a secret bank account in china pay time more taxis in beijing than PRON be pay in the united states and this guy talk about corruption look PRON be also go to act to protect health care trump of the republicans just jam through a supreme court nominee for one overwhelming reason as barack say the president say woman PRON have be try over shot to take out obamacare destroy the affordable care act but PRON be go to be in court i believe PRON be seven day after the election win or lose PRON be go to be in court if PRON get PRON way hundred million americans will lose protection for praise and condition include more than four million michigander donald trump think healthcare be a privilege barack and i think PRON be a right for people that bad at healthcare PRON be not only go to store obamacare PRON be go to build on PRON be go to keep PRON private insurance if PRON like PRON and PRON can choose a medical a medicare like public option if PRON do not PRON be go to increase subsidy to lower PRON premium and deductible out of pocket spending reduce prescription drug cost by percent look PRON be go to make sure PRON keep the protection for people of pre existing condition meanwhile donald trump lay out what PRON be go to do in PRON second term if PRON be elect to social security the actuary at the social security administration say if PRON get that plan pass PRON will quote bankrupt social security by something million of americans live on pay for PRON whole life when i say back six year ago as debbie will tell PRON when i say the republicans be go to try to eliminate medicare everybody say no that be crazy first thing paul ryan the republicans in the congress do be try to cut billion of dollar out of medicare these guy mean what PRON say PRON be go to protect social security medicare and medicaid because there be a lifeline for so many hard work folk but folk i have to admit to PRON PRON be kind of personal with PRON there be nothing bad that this president have do in PRON view than the way PRON speak about PRON woman and man in uniform and those who have give PRON life PRON call PRON loser and sucker PRON son beau be a major in the united states army give up the attorney general job and petition to be able to go with PRON unit to iraq for one solid year after as a u s attorney being in kosovo i may add PRON be go to be a typical dad PRON be the only foreigner in kosovo that have a foot memorial dedicate to PRON the major highway PRON build the bo biden highway because of PRON commitment PRON son come home with a bronze star that could speak of PRON service but like so many other before PRON pass away but less what PRON be not a sucker PRON be not a loser or any of PRON serve PRON be patriot and just like all of PRON son and daughter PRON parent and grandparent who serve the president like to portray PRON i love this like to portray PRON as a tough guy when PRON be in high school would not PRON have like to take the shot anyway PRON be a different story but anyway a macho man but when be the last time PRON read about saul hear about a present united states literally be laugh at by world leader when PRON speak to the united nations laugh at out loud when be the last time PRON see president united states be openly mock by the leader of nato at a nato conference and can PRON believe PRON have a president who act like vladimir putin puppy putin put bounty on the head of american soldier serve in iraq and trump be too scared to challenge PRON talk to PRON six time have never mention PRON trump be not strong PRON be weak PRON command little respect PRON be in the international stage this the president who not only do not understand sacrifice PRON do not understand courage physical courage PRON take to serve in uniform in a war zone maybe that be why six general and admiral who work for PRON leave PRON administration and say PRON be unfit to command be commander in chief when be the last time any president have have that happen tough guy that be why george special operations commander general stanley mcchrystal that be why head of the navy seal oversee the raid of bin laden admiral bill craven and other four star have endorse PRON say PRON support PRON to be PRON next commander in chief because like obama and bush and before PRON PRON know PRON respect PRON PRON will support PRON PRON have be in and out of war zone as senator and vice president over time i tell PRON what these folk PRON have only one percent of the country be in the military PRON owe PRON PRON be the backbone PRON be the sinew PRON be the heart of who PRON be that be why PRON have to support PRON military and get rid of trump folk PRON know i want to tell PRON something think about this this be a guy who say there be no such thing as climate change PRON call PRON a hoax i see PRON as job health and safety the impact on climate be too often fall disproportionately on poor community and community of color PRON be go to make sure community benefit from the hundred of billion of federal investment and infrastructure and climate change PRON be go to do as a consequence of the change in the structure PRON be go to create local job to rebuild road fill sidewall crack install broadband create space to live work and play safely to modernize infrastructure so PRON can turn on the faucet and clean water come out and when that happen in flint will never happen again anywhere in america PRON can not and must do this donald trump have roll back more than environmental protection law many enact under barack and PRON PRON also hold polluted PRON will call polluter accountable with the most ambitious environmental justice agenda ever folk PRON be an act to deliver on racial justice in america protest be not burn or loot violence have can not be tolerate and PRON will not but these protester be a cry for justice the name of george florida taylor jacob blake will not soon be forget PRON be go to inspire a new wave of justice in america america have have PRON eye open up PRON be ready look i believe this country have to come together i know when i announce well over a year ago when i say i want to unite the country everybody say that be naive that be a long time ago PRON do PRON before biden but PRON can not do PRON again well PRON can and PRON must PRON have no choice that be how democracy work PRON be run as a proud democrat but i will govern as an american president PRON will work as hard for those who do not support PRON as those who do that be the job of a president PRON be a duty to care a duty to care for everyone so

the last five months it's a a number that we never even thought possible nobody did nobody thought it was possible and we're going to now even do better than that it's going very rapidly well foreign nations are in a free fall you see what's going on with so many nations and europe unfortunately i say that with sadness we are creating an economic powerhouse unrivaled anywhere in the world a recent gallup poll found that 56 of americans say they are better off today than they were four years ago under obama and biden you got to remember that so you got to remember that kind of thing they didn't do a good job in fact if they did i wouldn't have run if they did i wouldn't be here right now they did a bad job and obama he went out yesterday with biden they got like 14 people they didn't have too many they didn't have too good a crowd and we have five of these today five we have some big ones thank you thank you thank you very much [Music] thank you thank you very much thank you and i love you too and i appreciate that we appreciate it i was i was thinking coming in because i watch these fake polls everyone no matter if if we're up by 10 if we know we're gonna win easily he's down by one point he's down by one uh i just watched this fake stuff and i was saying to myself you know we've been under a phony fake hoax investigation for three years nothing but bad and really corrupt publicity from these people and i i say i wonder what the difference would have been had it been legit right had it been legit and it turned out to be just the opposite they were the ones that committed the crimes not us but i wonder what it would have been i could probably would have been a little bit easier but you know the good news we're going to win anyway we're going to shove it look at the wind anyway i wonder what it would have been i wonder what it would have been if all of the nonsense wasn't brought up thank you very much thank you very much looking tremendous in florida so of course they don't mention that you know it's florida we are looking good we're really looking good all over in the real polls not the fox polls those fox polls somebody in fox doesn't like me very much i can tell you they are the phoniest pulse and they were they were almost as bad uh four years ago actually there were worse but you get some of these pollsters uh they work magic and the amazing thing is and they they hang on to their jobs they do horribly look at what they did last i had nine states and i had to win them all and they said i was going to lose all nine this is four years ago i was going to lose all nine it's going to be a very short evening for donald trump and the poll said decisively i was going to lose all nine and that was the day before and i won all nine i want no i won or i wouldn't be here right now now i won all nine and said we're gonna lose all nine and it was quite depressing as i turned on the television let's see how we did he won florida he won south carolina helper thank you and then they said they're getting rid of the guy like at fox i heard they were getting rid of that pulse turn they kept them and they have others they kept and you wonder what kind of a business that is you wonder what guy we have a case where in wisconsin i have we're one up and i left there a couple of days ago we had a rally you wouldn't believe it packed just packed just like last night like here but like last night this was a section you know i wanted to come this is considered a small beautiful cute little wonderful section and they asked me and i said i want to be there no and every vote counts it's very important we had something last night in miami you would not have believed it i don't know who saw it on television i don't know but you you look at some of these uh results in wisconsin so you know whether i'm up one or down one it's right in that thing i think we're going to win wisconsin because we have a lot of people that say uh we don't want to talk to you and then they go vote for trump right you know the hidden voter or whatever they call them somebody said they're the shy voters my people are not shy but in wisconsin so they said abc news which is in my opinion corrupt but they're all corrupt abc news washington post which is basically a uh lobbyist as far as i'm concerned for amazon it's just a lobbyist so they didn't say like he's two down three down four down a fake poll they said trump is 17 points down in wisconsin now the real number i mean you know i could lose it i could win it i think it's you know i don't know how i'm not i did a lot of good things for wisconsin but you know let's say it's even and i call up a great pollster john i said john let me ask you a question i think we're one up in wisconsin but abc washington post they did the same thing four years ago if you remember that very close to the election they said we're down 12. and then we won right but we were down 12. and it's disheartening it's called suppression what it does is it suppresses people they say well listen we love the president but if he can't win so abc but they did it four years ago and we complained bitterly with a very good lawyer i had very good lawyers in those days we complained very bitterly and they changed it right before the election i think it was one right we're down one they took it from twelve to one and it's like about 15 seconds and i realized i said this is a phony business but now they come down and it says 17 down in wisconsin 17. so i called john john mclaughlin he's he's like the dean he's a great guy and he's been very good with me i mean he said we're going to win four years ago he said he said we're going to win easily this one he's a he's probably the biggest and the best i said john let me ask you a question abc washington post came out with a poll it said i was 17 down i'm not 17 down i might be one down or i might be too up but i'm not 17 down what's going on why don't they make it at least because they have to live after that they have to do other events another why don't they make it three or four or two or five or something right he said they can't do that because they want you to lose and if you're two or three or four everyone's going to go vote they want to make sure that your people don't vote and when you're 17 down people say i just can't waste my time i'm not going to stand online and i said isn't that sick and he said he knows some of the people and they're very smart they're very brilliant they're smart people he said but if they made it five down or four down or six down even so they make it something that's so bad 17 down i said isn't that a shame i want to tell that story do you mind you said i don't care that's the way it is so it's crooked stuff the fox polls are horrible every time i have a fox poll it's horrible i mean i like some of the things on fox certainly sean and laura and tucker's been great lately and fox and friends in the morning is great right we go through them we have we have some i find harris to be great harris faulkner to be really good she's been very good over a period of time the great lou dobbs he's been fantastic right right janine how do you like janine and you know look we have some uh we have some great people that support us jesse has been great people has been great and i don't want to mention you know there are a lot of people look we have a lot but it's 90 negative everything you know everything it's that but so think of that so i said 17. and he gave me an answer i just thought it was so incredible i said i got to tell that answer so i hope i haven't bored you but i thought it was interesting i thought it was it just to me it was interesting and and you know i have like uh five of these to do today so let's get going and i appreciate you being here we had some we had some monsters last night we had some little rough weather it wasn't like this we had uh in michigan we had a slightly cold day with the wind blowing at 40 miles an hour in my face and you're lucky you have a president that doesn't need a teleprompter i was able thank you good memory i would have been in big trouble there was no way you could hold paper there was no way you could do where you were just and my guys set it up where the wind was right smack in my face and i was looking at that flag from the play and i said oh no here we go again but actually the flag must be a very high quality silk because it's not that windy but yesterday it was not that was not an easy day we had some very cold stops at biden and harris kamala kamala you want her you want her as your first woman president i don't think so and the radical left gain power they will collapse our economy and send our nation into a depression biden will raise your taxes four trillion dollars massively increase your regulations close down your factories send your jobs overseas that's what he's been doing all his life him and his group destroy the suburbs dissolve your borders terminate religious liberty outlaw private health insurance 180 million people have great health insurance shred your second amendment confiscate your guns and indoctrinate your children with anti-american lies biden has vowed to abolish the american oil and natural gas industries and ban fracking he said it for a year and a half he said it then all of a sudden he goes to pennsylvania no i never said that and the fake news doesn't do anything about it barton's energy ban will send every state into crushing poverty from north carolina to michigan to pennsylvania as long as i'm president we will remain the number one producer of oil and natural gas on earth and we will remain energy independent [Applause] sleepy joe biden is a globalist who spent 47 years outsourcing your jobs opening your borders and sacrificing american blood and treasure in endless foreign wars in countries that most of you have never even heard of he was a cheerleader for naftan they're all coming home don't worry about it i said it [Applause] he was a cheerleader for nafta and china's entry into the world trade organization north carolina lost 50 percent of all manufacturing jobs after those biden betrayals and now he says oh i'm going to he's trying to follow my policy he's trying to follow my policy he's not going to view my policy he's been doing this for 47 years plus and for eight years as vice president which was only three and a half years ago joe biden is a corrupt politician who raked in millions from china while giving them your jobs [Applause] he's a corrupt he's a corrupt politician you see it now they say the laptop shift watermelon head shift that laptop was produced by russia here we go again russia russia russia here we go again can you imagine what they must think of and these people are crazy now i was it was produced by where's hunter that's right it was produced by ayaka these guys are really think of it now schiff knows he's uh you know psycho in many ways but he knows it's a total con game i had to put up with it for three years and it affects it you know when you see nothing but negative television every night every night every night and then they find totally no collusion after wasting 48 million dollars 18 people think of it and then it's no collusion but then you have to run but you've had three years of horrible publicity and they did it i mean they did it they were the criminals hillary was a criminal she deleted her emails people go to jail for that these are criminals these are criminals and say it anyway you want to do it but we took the brunt that we caught him spying on my campaign and trying to overthrow a duly elected president of the united states so i go and that was before i even knew i mean that was while i was while i was running i didn't even know i'd hear these things sir uh this is before i got elected guys would come up to me every once in a while sir do you have anything to do with russia i said no what do you ask oh i was just curious because it was like this thing floating around then they come up again sir are you sure you don't have anything to do with russia i said it has nothing to do with russia what the hell are you talking about and you know you hear it four or five times then you get into office and they come up with this scheme and this this plot there's a plot to overthrow the government to the united states and then we have people that just don't act fast i mean it's just unbelievable we have so much we have so much information we have so much we have the whole thing and obama was involved and biden was involved they were involved but it's let's let's see what happens people should move more quickly in 2016 north carolina voted to fire this corrupt political establishment and you elected an outsider as president who is finally putting america first and if i don't sound like a typical washington politician it's because i'm not a politician if i don't always play by the rules of the washington establishment it's because i was elected to fight for you and i fight harder than any president has ever fought for his people thank you thank you thank you thank you [Applause] get out and vote that's all i ask just take a little time and vote we got to win this state i think we win this state we win pennsylvania we're going to win florida we win pennsylvania and you we're going to win the whole thing they'll win the whole thing and we'll send them a signal like they've never seen before this has not happened to them big tech is so powerful you can't beat big tech they're saying this and i see it on twitter trending trending trend right it's not trending they put the most boring thing only it was anything bad about me number one in the world on trend right boring stuff i mean like stuff as opposed to affairs scandals that they don't even put that stuff up it's always trump two three four five items it's a fix it's a fix this is a smart guy we have his name everybody knows who he is and i'm not talking about the primary i'm talking about people that work they take stuff out of my head let's see this is bad about trump let's make it worse okay we'll make it worse okay number one trend in the whole world no that's not stuff that trends but these are phony guys they fix the elections and you know what they should be subject to campaign violations because it's they're uh they're in arm of the democrat national committee they work together they work on messaging together the democrats the fake news media they're the worst the fact that they're fake people and if i've done one thing it's to expose the dishonesty in the media and not everybody but a big vast majority a vast majority not everybody look at us we catch hunter and joe cheating we catch them stealing millions of dollars they refuse to write a story could you imagine if i got three and a half million dollars from the mayor of moscow's wife could you imagine somebody gave me three and a half million bucks somebody gave me 20 i got they impeached me because i made a perfect phone call to the head of ukraine i never met the gentleman congratulations on your win if you see anything corrupt please call the attorney general of the united states and we have a corruption agreement with them because it's been a very corrupt country i actually have an obligation now of course they impeached before they found out before i decided to release the phone call isn't it lucky that i had that call transcribed can you imagine now can you imagine now they couldn't do they didn't know what to do crazy nancy said this is an impeachable she said you're right they said you're right but let's go through with it anyway maybe we'll get lucky can you no this is what because she didn't know about the call when she read the call she said he didn't do anything wrong how did you get me into this you shifty shift how did you do it jerry nadler i've been fighting this guy for 25 years on the east side of manhattan the west side of manhattan jerry nadler he's a beauty isn't he how did he get me into this well let's just keep going forward it's a disgrace and we won i will say this for the republicans 197 or 697 to nothing we won and in the senate 52 and a half to one half we lost a half of it i wonder who that could have been but sleepy joe biden is bought and paid for by china he's got hey they gave the son a billion and a half dollars to manage that means he's going to make millions of dollars a year he doesn't know anything about investment didn't know anything at all about energy got a hundred and eighty three thousand dollars a month on energy think of that think of that hundred and eighty three thousand dollars i called a friend of mine on wall street is this a normal fee he said no maybe the most abnormal fear i've ever seen in my whole life i've been doing this for 25 years he's the biggest guy but they're bought and paid for they got the money and then they were going for the big one in china they wrote a letter to a very big powerful man within the communist party and where's hunter s for 10 million dollars a year as he was going to recommend he was going to talk you're gonna see here's a guy didn't have a job got thrown out of the navy he got thrown out of the navy he didn't have a job biden becomes vice president and this kid is like a vacuum cleaner going all over the world following his father picking up the scraps no he's following his dad picking up scraps and then you find the note where the big man gets 10 the big man's joe bye the big man gets 10 then in one case they said 50 right that's more likely because he wouldn't do it for 10. he'd want because these people are all hangers on losers but uh that's the story and it's in a laptop and now they say the laptop was made by russia therefore it has no credibility can you no no can you believe this all right and so the news there's not outside of the new york post which really i hold in high esteem they have done they're like a hero paper and they endorsed me i got a nice endorsement from did you see from pennsylvania yesterday right pittsburgh pittsburgh gazette that was nice once i got through that first paragraph it was phenomenal actually they said we don't love his personality we don't love his tough demeanor but i have to be tough look i've been under investigation from before i ever became president i have to be tough if i was soft i wouldn't be here right now and they don't want to say that i was under a fake investigation by a lot of fake people bob mueller and his crew the whole thing was a fake scam that should have never been started and they knew the answer on the first day but it took him two and a half years to put it down no collusion but they knew the answer the first day so i was under investigation for the first two and a half years right think of that and then they say he's tough but i'll take it anyway i'll take their endorsement anyway because once you get over the first paragraph or two it says all of the things we've done which are incredible which are incredible and now we'll have a chance to do it without the cloud because i had a cloud hanging over my head whether we like it or not and then they say he was tough he fought too hard he was somewhat crude he was very very nasty his twitter now you know what if i didn't have social media i wouldn't be here it was the only way i could defend myself so it's one of those things but i just wonder i was thinking i asked the people on the way up we have great people such loyal great people including a man that comes from an area not too far from here is a good friend of these women who've been here this is number 64 time for these incredible beautiful i think rich women and their husbands are in here someplace but they had their husbands they were at the one last night that was a big deal wasn't it but uh this is number 64 i would say right 65 oh there's two more they come from north carolina but we have mark meadows comes from north carolina and he has been fantastic he's done a great job he's done a great job where is he he's probably working you know he's bum bum bum with a phone it's got two phones instead of one and he's not gonna break it up with a hammer like hillary did he's gonna it's gonna throw it away he'll come down watch he's done a fantastic job and he is and he loves this state he loves north carolina and i specifically said i want somebody from north carolina and give me meadows now i knew three years ago i said we got to get meadows in here big tech big media big donors and powerful special interests are desperate for sleepy jail to win they want him to win i'll tell you who wants them to win china they will own our country because they own him they control him and they know he will always be there to do their bidding he'll always be there he's a corrupt he's a corrupt politician i don't care i'll say and i say it everybody knows it's true can you imagine big tech refuses to put anything in they took the new york post down for two weeks because they they won't let anyone write if you put out a little tweet and say that biden is corrupt they will knock out your whole account nobody's ever seen anything like this and you notice it is outside of what i say it is indeed fading away because you can't have a scandal if nobody writes about it so we have the fake news not writing about it and you have the big tech not right so so how can you have a scandal nobody's talking about it nobody's allowed to talk it's called suppression we don't have freedom of the press we don't have probably haven't had it for a long time but we don't have you know they say freedom of the press the american way we don't have we have suppression by the press that's what it is what beautiful words i should have done the speech this way would have been much more interesting or whatever no but seriously we have suppression by the press this is not freedom this is the act it really is it's the exact opposite of freedom of the press you know if you think about it every corrupt force in american life that is responsible for cruel betrayals that hurt our family and you know all of the people that we love they're supported by biden and they donate about you know i could have been a much bigger fundraiser than him but i didn't want to call every head of a wall street firm every head of the oil companies that we've made rich anyway i did a great job we're energy independent that's not so bad first time the failed establishment that started the disastrous foreign wars they support sleepy joe biden because they get anything they want and he took in 300 million dollars last month you think he made any deals no i don't think so the career politicians that offshored your industries and decimated your factories they support sleepy joe the open borders lobbyists that killed our fellow citizens with illegal drugs gangs and crimes the people that wanted to stop the wall even though it knew it works almost finished by the way we finished very soon but the people that wanted to stop it even the though they knew full well it worked remember they said no no we don't want a wall walls are obsolete we want drones drones okay good drones flying to watch the people pour into our country they want drones let's have drones the far left democrats that ruined our public schools depleted our inner cities defunded our police and demeaned your sacred faith and values they support sleepy joe biden you can't even go to your churches you can't even go to your church and your governor of north carolina you got to open up your state [Applause] [Music] you got to get your governor i hope you're going to vote for dan who's good but you got to get your state open don't worry about it on november 4th they'll announce your state is opening on november 4th uh north carolina will be opened on november 4. the anti right after the election the entire because they want us to look bad they don't care about people they want us to look bad they want to try and steal an election the anti-american radicals defaming our noble history our heritage our heroes they support sleepy joe antifa and the riders and looters and marxists and left-wing extremists they all support joe biden they always like to blame it on the right you haven't noticed these were right-wing and uh it's very rare it's where it's you get bad on every side but they always like to blame the right it always starts off with the right the right this election comes down to a simple choice do you want to be ruled by the arrogant corrupt ruthless and selfless political class or do you want to be governed by the american people themselves do you want to be represented by a career politician who hates you or by an outsider who will defend you like you have never been defended before i didn't need this job i had a very nice laugh but i love what we're doing for our country nobody's done so much nobody no administration and you know i never even had a challenge on this from the fake news you know normally if you say something slightly off they make a big deal no administration president has done more in the first three and a half years than we have our military we rebuilt our tax cut our regulation cuts [Applause] space force just a thing like space was i never even talked about space force right during the campaign i did more than i actually talked about during the campaign [Music] thank you thank you very much [Applause] thank you [Music] i thought this was a small little cute area you know this was this small little cute area when i came in i'm watching fox and a gentleman and anchor said they have a small crowd of about 2 000 2 500. i knew i knew you know it's it's an incredible thing this is a lot more than that there's a lot of people there's a lot more than we but i wanted to be here because it's an important mistake i mean my granddaughter is named carolina do you know that and we'll give south carolina some credit too you know they've been with us is that okay i want to get your permission no we'll give south carolina south carolina is they're great people too a vote for biden is a vote to hand the keys to government over to people who despise you and who want to rob your children of their american dream that's what they're doing a vote for biden is a vote to give control of government over to the globalists communists socialists the wealthy liberal hypocrites who want to silence censor cancel and punish you if you want your children to be safe and remember this against this i'll put it very simply against the second amendment right if you're pro-life you can forget about it you know that right tremendous support we have we have did you see these people in california they have lines of hundreds of miles of cars and tractors and iowa and boats five or six thousand boats in lakes and oceans with the flags if you want your values to be respected if you want to be treated with honor and dignity and respect then i am asking for you to go out tomorrow or sooner but i don't know you tend to like to vote on election day right we all do and vote is going to be the most important election in my opinion in the history of our country i never thought i was going to say it if you would have told me i was going to say that four years ago i would have said you're crazy but uh it's the most important because i've always said we will never be a socialist nation and that's what they're trying [Applause] well and remember what i said four years ago is that i am your voice and we will make america great again and that's what we're doing and and if we didn't get hit by the china plague now we're building it up again and we're doing it at record clip and record numbers and at a much faster pace than any other country in the world but we got hit by the plague from china and we will never forget it with god as my witness i will never let you down for the last four years the depraved swamp has tried everything to stop me because they know i don't answer to them i answer to you together we will defeat the corrupt establishment we will dethrone the failed political class and we will drain the washington swamp and we will save the american dream this election is also a choice between a deadly biden lockdown he wants to have you locked down i don't even know if he knows i'm into beyond they ask him a question i don't i don't think he has a clue you can vote whoever you want but i don't think he has a clue you know it the media knows it the media laughs behind his back and then they say he did brilliantly today no he didn't do brilliantly he can't do he didn't do brilliantly in his prime and he's not in his prime anymore or a safe vaccine that ends the pandemic and we're doing very well with the vaccines they'll be distributed very soon we will mass distribute the vaccine in just a few short weeks it will quickly eradicate the virus and wipe out the china plague once and for all joe biden is promising to delay the vaccine and turn america into a prison state looking again that's more kamala you know remember when they said this is the harris biden administration right i never did that with mike and you know what mike pence never came to you he said do you mind if i put my name first every once in a while no because and by the way he's been a great vice president some people say it was a perfect combination it was he's a great guy he loves he's going to be in your state in a little while locking you in your home while letting far left rioters roam free the biden lockdown will mean no school no graduations no weddings no thanksgiving no easter no christmas no 4th of july and no future for america's youth other than that it's fine i think it's just if you want a vaccine to kill the virus a job to support your family and freedom to live your life then you go and cast your ballot for president trump and if you remember the catastrophe joe biden who's telling us how to run things right this guy never ran a thing successfully he was said horrible things about him when he was in the administration obama didn't even want to endorse him he wouldn't endorse him even after he won obama said this is no way how long did it take him after he won it took forever obama couldn't believe it i don't think obama is much better you want to know the truth joe biden personally ran the swine flu right the swine flu h1n1 which he can never remember he never says it he says it goes n1h1 i said don't he failed horribly and he was a laughingstock all over washington they were laughing at him and his own chief of staff said he was absolutely terrible they had a terrible they did a terrible job now he's telling us how to do it i should have closed earlier there's only one problem he's on record all over the place knocking me two and a half months later for closing too soon and closing it all he said don't close he's xenophobic you know xenophobic i didn't like people from china is what he's saying it's so wrong i think they're incredible people i do i think they're incredible people but they he said xenophobic and then he runs for off he says he should have closed earlier and you know what the press never covers that they just you can't get the only time i get it covered is if i happen to be on live television i'll say it again and again and when i do say it they try and turn it off let's go to a commercial break right now i think i know what's coming these are really bad people secretary of defense robert gates said that biden has been wrong on every actually or nearly every major foreign policy and national security issue over the past four decades he had no respect for him whatsoever i'm sure he endorsed him because he's probably looking for something like everybody else but i don't think any of them are going to get anything because i think we're going to have one of the greatest victories tomorrow but you don't have to take my word for what a disaster joe biden is because it's the great state of north carolina i spent a fortune see this see the board i spent a lot of money on the board so let's just take a look at uh a little roll let's roll up please have you taken a cognitive no i haven't taken the test why the hell would i take a test come on man that's like saying you before you got in this program you take a test where you're taking cocaine or not what do you think huh are you a joke by the way it's my little sister valerie and i'm jill's husband oh no oh you switched on me this is my sister they switched on me but i tell it if you have a problem figuring out whether you're for me or trump and you ain't black there is not a single solitary reason in the world why why as i said we shouldn't be in a position that everybody and that's my wife jill hey jilly i'm jill's husband actually and cornpop was a bad dude and he ran a bunch of bad boys and i did yeah he and back in those days you shot things have changed play the radio make sure the television excuse me make sure you have the record player on at night the the phone make sure the kids hear words we hold these truths to be self-evident all men and women created by the go you know the you know the thing because if you could take care you were a quartermaster you can sure in health take care of running a you know department store uh thing you know were in the second floor of the ladies department you know i mean well i'm sick and tired of smart guys [Applause] you know the rapidly rising uh um uh in with uh with uh i don't know uh mendo caucus no you haven't you're a lion dog-faced pony soldier you're getting nervous man what kind of country we're gonna be four more years of george uh georgia he uh is going to find ourselves in a position where if uh trump gets elected uh we're going to be we're going to be in a different world you know we have to come together that's why i'm running i'm running as a proud democrat for the senate and by the way you know i sit on the stand and it get hot i got a lot of i got hairy legs that turn that that that that that that turn uh um blonde in the sun and the kids used to come up and reach in the pool and rub my leg down so it was trained and then watched the hair come back up again they'd look at it so i learned about roaches i learned about kids jumping on my lap and i've loved kids jumping on my lap barack and i think it's a right for people that bad at healthcare i'll need an effective strategy to mobilize true international pressure don't do it don't do it don't do it to [Applause] yourselves [Applause] our country has such potential you can't do that to our country he's not mentally equipped he just isn't to be your president he's not equipped to be your president and i say it you know i say it because he's not a nice person never was a nice person but he was never a smart person he was a touchy feely person you know hail and hearty but not nice but this is not a man that 25 years ago was not equipped to be your president and he ran many times numerous times we called him one percent joe think of it and now he's working on about 50 and he ends up winning their nomination because of elizabeth warren elizabeth warren gave him the number all she had to do is drop out and he would have lost on super i mean that we would have had crazy bernie say you know what the hell but at least bernie you know they had a great energetic base at uh small base but energetic but uh this is not a man that should be your president we have tremendous potential our country has tremendous potential and we can't blow it we can't blow it [Applause] because there's no way to describe that and and that's like one percent we could keep you out here all day much of it happened yesterday and the day before yesterday oh he had some beauties yesterday but we can't do this and you know what's gonna happen kamala will be put in that position very quickly and she's more liberal than crazy bernie she's more liberal in fact she makes him look like a strict conservative joining us today are some incredible people incredible friends and warriors and i want to tell you i just looked at a poll and he's up in the poll senator tom tell us he's up he's up that's great i'm good i'm very happy with that that's we got to get him and he's a good man good man and your wife was

PRON know the answer on the first day but PRON take PRON two and a half year to put PRON down no collusion but PRON know the answer the first day so i be under investigation for the first two and a

165,ST-_2tI2mtI,harris,2020-11-03T01:53:00Z,WATCH LIVE: John Legend performs at election eve rally for Harris in Philadelphia,speech,hello philadelphia [Applause] man it is good to be back in pennsylvania what beautiful weather we got here a little indian summer you know i know the president spent some time in erie last night and apparently he complained about having to travel here then he cut the event short poor guy i i don't feel that way i love coming to pennsylvania you guys delivered for me twice and i am back here tonight to ask you to deliver the white house for joe biden and kamala harris i want to thank mr philadelphia charlie mack his daughter india marie what an outstanding young lady she was those of you who are fathers and have daughters you know how that feels when when you see your daughters just shining i know a little bit about that and it was great to see representatives brendan boyle mary gay scanlon governor tom wolf attorney general josh shapiro mayor jim kenney philadelphia we got 13 days that's our lucky number right here 13 days until the most important election of our lifetimes you don't have to you don't have to wait for november third to cast your ballot you've got two ways to vote right now number one you can vote early in person through next tuesday how many people anybody here voted early already just if you haven't just go to iwillvote.com pa and find out where you can vote early number two you can vote from home with a mail-in ballot just go to iwillvote.com pa to request your ballot right away and before you send it back pennsylvania's got this thing where you've got to use both envelopes so you've got to read the directions carefully to make sure your vote counts and if you've already voted then you've got to help your friends and family make a plan to vote take them with you if you vote early or if you vote in person on election day because this election requires every single one of us to do our part and what we do these next 13 days will matter for decades to come now the last time i was in philadelphia i was at the constitution center and i was delivering a speech for the democratic national convention this year and i said during that speech i've sat in the oval office with both of the men who are running for president and they are very different people i explained that i never thought donald trump would embrace my vision or continue my policies but i did hope for the sake of the country that he might show some interest in taking the job seriously but it hasn't happened he hasn't shown any interest in doing the work or helping anybody but himself and his friends or treating the presidency like a reality show that he can use to get attention and by the way even then his tv ratings are down so you know that upsets but the thing is this is not a reality show this is reality and the rest of us have had to live with the consequences of him proving himself incapable of taking the job seriously at least 220 000 americans have died more than 100 000 small businesses have closed millions of jobs are gone our proud reputation around the world is in tatters presidents up for re-election usually ask if the country is better off than it was four years ago i'll tell you one thing four years ago you'd be tailgating here at the link instead of watching a speech from your cars the only people truly better off than they were four years ago are the billionaires who got his tax cuts right now as we speak trump won't even extend relief to the millions of families who are having trouble paying the rent or putting food on the table because of this pandemic but he's been doing all right by himself as it turns out this was just reported in the last 48 hours we know that he continues to do business with china because he's got a secret chinese bank account how is that possible how is that possible a secret chinese bank account listen can you imagine if i had a secret chinese bank account when i was running for reelection you think you think my you think fox news might have been a little concerned about that they would have called me beijing barry it is not a great idea to have a president who owes a bunch of money to people overseas that's that's not a good idea i mean of the taxes donald trump pays he may be sending more to foreign governments than he pays in the united states his first year in the white house he only paid 750 dollars in federal income tax listen my first job was at a baskin-robbins when i was 15 years old i think i might have paid more taxes that year working at a dispensing ice cream how is that possible how many people here paid less than that it's possible just possible now that if if you are living high on the hog and you only pay 750 dollars in taxes that maybe just maybe he might not know what working people are going through here in pennsylvania we cannot afford four more years of this philadelphia but the good news is right now you can choose change right now you can vote for my friend joe biden and his running mate kamala harris as the next president and vice president of the united states of america now joe joe's no stranger to he he's a native son scrappy kid from scranton you know him and you know he knows you but let me let me tell you how i came to know him and and how i came to love him 12 years ago when i chose when i chose joe biden as vice president as as my vice presidential running bait i didn't know joe all that well we had served in the senate together but we weren't super close he and i came from different places we came from different generations but i came to admire joe as a man who has learned early on to treat everybody he meets with dignity and respect living by the words his parents taught him no one's better than you joe but you're better than nobody and that empathy that decency that belief that everybody counts that's who joe is that's who he'll be and i can tell you the presidency doesn't change who you are it reveals who you are and joe has shown himself to be a friend of working people for eight years joe was the last one in the room when i faced a big decision he made me a better president and he's got the character and experience to make us a better country and he and kamala are going to be in the fight not for themselves but for every single one of us look i get that this president wants full credit for the economy he inherited and zero blame for the pandemic that he ignored but you know what the job doesn't work that way tweeting at the television doesn't fix things making stuff up doesn't make people's lives better you've got to have a plan you've got to put in the work and along with the experience to get things done joe biden has concrete plans and policies that will turn our vision of a better fairer stronger country into a reality literally left this white house a pandemic playbook that would have shown them how to respond before the virus reached our shores they probably used it to i don't know prop up a wobbly table somewhere we don't know where that playbook went eight months into this pandemic cases are rising again across this country donald trump isn't suddenly going to protect all of us he can't even take the basic steps to protect himself just last night he complained up in erie that the pandemic made him go back to work i'm quoting here he was he was upset that the pandemics made him go back to work if he'd actually been working the whole time it never would have gotten this bad so look here's the truth i want to be honest here this pandemic would have been challenging for any president but this idea that somehow this white house has done anything but completely screw this up is just not true i'll give you a very specific example korea identified its first case at the same time that the united states did at the same time their per capita death toll is just 1.3 percent of what ours is in canada it's just 39 percent of what ours is other countries are still struggling with the pandemic but they're not doing as bad as we are because they've got a government that's actually been paying attention and that means lives lost and that means an economy that doesn't work and just yesterday when asked if he'd do anything differently trump said not much really not much nothing you can think of that could have helped some people keep their loved ones alive so joe's not going to screw up testing he's not going to call scientists idiots he's not going to host a super spreader event at the white house joe will get this pandemic under control with a plan to make testing free and widely available to get a vaccine to every american cost free and to make sure our front line heroes never ask other countries for the equipment they need his plan will guarantee paid sick leave for workers and parents affected by the pandemic and make sure that the small businesses that hold our communities together and employ millions of americans can reopen safely you know donald donald trump likes to claim he built this economy but america created 1.5 million more jobs in the last three years of the obama biden administration than in the first three years of the trump pence administration how you figure that and that was before he could blame the pandemic now he did inherit the longest streak of job growth in american history but just like everything else he inherited he messed it up the economic damage he inflicted by botching the pandemic response means he will be the first president since herbert hoover to actually lose jobs joe's got a plan to create 10 million good clean energy jobs as part of a historic two trillion dollar investment to fight climate change to secure environmental justice and he'll pay he'll pay for it by rolling back that tax cut for billionaires and joe sees this moment not just as a chance to get back to where we were but to finally make long overdue changes so that our economy actually makes life a little easier for everybody the waitress trying to raise her kid on her own the student trying to figure out how to pay for next semester's classes the shift worker who's always on the edge of getting laid off the cancer survivor who's worried about her pre-existing conditions protections being taken away let me tell you saying pennsylvania this i know to be true joe and kamala will protect your health care and expand medicare and make insurance more affordable for everybody you know republicans love to say right before an election that they'll protect your pre-existing conditions now joe and i actually protected your policies to make sure people with pre-existing conditions could get health insurance and have coverage we did it through something called the affordable care act aka obamacare and republicans tried to repeal or undermine it more than 60 times and when they've been asked about they they keep on promising we're going to have a great replacement they said it's coming it's been coming in two weeks for the last 10 years where is it where is this great plan to replace obamacare they've had 10 years to do it there is no plan they've never had one instead they've attacked the affordable care act at every turn driving up costs driving up the uninsured now they're trying to dismantle your care in the supreme court as we speak as quickly as they can in the middle of a pandemic with nothing but empty promises to take its place it's shameful the idea that you would take health care away from people at the very moment where people need it most what is the logic of that there is no logic joe knows that a first the first job of a president is to keep us safe from all threats foreign domestic or microscopic when the daily intelligence briefings flash warning signs about a virus a president can't ignore him he can't be awol just like when russia puts bounties on the heads of our soldiers in afghanistan the commander-in-chief can't be missing an action i i can tell you this joe biden would never call the men and women of our military suckers or losers who does that he knows these these heroes are somebody's children somebody's spouse somebody's dad or mom he understands that and he's going to restore our standing in the world because he knows that america's true strength comes from setting an example that the world wants to follow a nation that stands with democracy not dictators a nation that can mobilize and inspire others to overcome threats like climate change and terrorism and poverty and disease and with joe and kamala at the helm you're not going to have to think about the crazy things they said every day and that's worth a lot you're not going to have to argue about them every day [Music] it just won't be so exhausting you you might be able to have a thanksgiving dinner without having an argument you'll be able to go about your lives knowing that the president is not going to retweet conspiracy theories about secret cabals running the world or or that navy seals didn't actually kill bin laden think about that the president of the united states retweeted that imagine what what we're not going to have a president that goes out of his way to insult anybody who doesn't support him or or threaten them with jail that's not normal presidential behavior we wouldn't tolerate it from a high school principal we wouldn't tolerate it from a coach we wouldn't tolerate it from a co-worker we we wouldn't tolerate it in our own family except for maybe crazy uncle somewhere you know yeah he's he's i mean we why would we expect and ex accept this from the president of the united states and how why are folks making excuses for that oh well that's just that's just him no it's no there are consequences to these actions they embolden other people to be cruel and divisive and racist and it frays the fabric of our society and it affects how our children see things and it affects the ways that our families get along it affects how the world looks at america that behavior matters character matters and by the way while he's doing all that it distracts all of us from the truly destructive actions that his appointees are doing all across the government actions that affect your lives you know the environmental protection agency that's supposed to protect our air and our water is right now run by an energy lobbyist that gives polluters free rain to dump unlimited poison into our air and water the labor department that's supposed to protect workers and their rights right now it's run by a corporate lobbyist who's declared war on workers guts protections to to keep essential folks safe during a pandemic makes it easier for big corporations to shortchange them on their wages the interior department that's supposed to protect our public lands and wild spaces our wildlife and our wilderness and right now that's run by an oil lobbyist who's determined to sell them to the highest bidder you've got the education department that's supposed to give every kid a chance and that's run by a billionaire who guts rules designed to protect students from getting ripped off by for-profit colleges and stiff-arm students looking for loan relief in the middle of an economic collapse i mean the person who runs medicaid right now is doing their best to kick people off of medicaid instead of signing them up for medicaid come on when joe and kamala are in charge they're not going to surround themselves with hacks and lobbyists but they're going to appoint qualified public servants who actually care about looking out for you for your job for your family for your health for your security for your planet and that more than anything is what separates them from their opponents they actually care about every american including the ones that don't agree with them and they're going to fight for you every day they care about you and they care about this democracy they believe in a democracy the right to vote is sacred and that we shouldn't be making people wait in line for 10 hours to cast their ballot we should be making it easier for everybody to vote they believe that no one especially the president is above the law they understand that protest on behalf of social justice isn't un-american that's the most american thing there is that's how this country was founded protesting injustice they understand we don't threaten our political opponents threatening to throw them in jail just because we disagree with them they understand that our ability to work together to solve big problems like a pandemic depends more than on just photo ops it depends on actually learning the facts and following the science and not just making stuff up whenever it's convenient we our democracy is not going to work if the people who are supposed to be our leaders lie every day and just make things up i mean and we've just become numb to it we just become immune to it every single day fact checkers can't keep up and and and look this this notion of truthfulness and democracy and and citizenship and being responsible these aren't republican or democratic principles they're american principles they're what we're they're what we most of us grew up learning from our parents and our grandparents they're not white or black or latino or asian values their american values human values and we need to reclaim them we have to get those values back at the center of our public life and we can but but to do it we've got to turn out like never before we cannot leave any doubt in this election because you know he the president's already said if this is even close i'm going to just make stuff up he's already started to do it so we can't have any doubt we can't be complacent i don't care about the polls there were a whole bunch of polls last time didn't work out because a whole bunch of folks stayed at home and got lazy and complacent not this time not in this election not this side listen listen i i understand why a lot of americans can get frustrated by government and can feel like it doesn't make a difference even supporters of mine during my eight years there were times where stuff we wanted to get done didn't get done and people said well you know gosh if if obama didn't get it done then you know maybe it's just not going to happen look government is not going to solve every problem it's true every elected official is going to make some mistakes this is a big complicated country and the system's designed so that change happens slowly it doesn't happen overnight and and believe me i've got first-hand experience with the way republicans in congress abuse the rules to make it easy for special interest to stop progress but we can make things better and we sh we sure shouldn't be making things worse a president by himself can't solve every challenge in a global economy but if we've got joe biden and kamala harris in the white house and a house and senate that are focused on working people it can make a difference and get millions of people the help they need a president by himself can't eliminate all racial bias in our criminal justice system but if we've got district attorneys and states attorneys and sheriffs and police chiefs focused on equality and justice it can make things better in pennsylvania you just got to flip nine seats in your state house just five seats in your state senate to give democrats control and new life for policies they'll make a real difference to working families right now it can make things better and and it in the end pennsylvania that's what voting is about making things better not making things perfect but putting us on track so that a generation from now we can look back and say things got better starting now and that's what's voting's about voting is about using the power we have and pooling it together to get a government that's more concerned and more responsive and more focused on you and your lives and your children and your grandchildren and future generations and the fact that we don't get 100 of what we want right away is not a good reason not to vote it means we've got to vote and then get some change and then vote some more and then get some more change and then keep on voting until we get it right and we will never come close to seeing what it would be like if everybody voted when i hear people saying well i i don't know your vote don't make a difference we don't know because usually no more than half the people who could be voting vote we get 50 55 percent of people voting and then people say oh look you know not enough change happened well imagine what would happen at 60 percent voted what about 70 percent imagine january 20th when we swear in a president and a vice president who have a plan to get us out of this mess who believe in science and have a plan to protect this planet for our kids and who care about working americans and have a plan to help you start getting ahead and who believe in racial equality and gender equality and and believe in not discriminating against people because of their sexual orientation and are willing to bring us closer to an america where no matter what we look like and where we come from and who we love and what our last name is if we go out there and we work we can make it and we're part of an american family all of that is possible all of that is within our reach if we vote because let me tell you something pennsylvania some people ask me sometimes they say man how have you been able to take these last four years just watching all this how do you how do you keep your spirits up and and i tell them i say look for all the times these last four years that we've seen our worst impulses revealed we've also seen what our country can be at its best we've seen folks of every age and background who've packed city centers and airports in town squares just so families wouldn't be separated so another classroom wouldn't get shot up so our kids wouldn't grow up on an uninhabitable planet we've seen americans of all races joining together to declare in the face of injustice that black lives matter no more but no less so that no child in this country feels the continuing sting of racism we've seen folks our our essential workers our healthcare workers risking their lives day in day out to save somebody else's loved ones we've seen people volunteer and contribute to help those who are having an especially difficult time that right now that's true in pennsylvania that's true all across the country america is a good and decent place but we've just seen so much noise and nonsense that sometimes it's hard for us to remember philadelphia i'm asking you to remember what this country can be what it's like when we treat each other with respect and dignity what it's like when our elected officials actually behave responsibly i'm asking you to believe in joe's ability in kamala's ability to lead this country out of these dark times and help us build it back better because we can't abandon those who are hurting right now we can't abandon the children who aren't getting the education they need right now we can't abandon those protesters who inspired us we've got to channel their activism into action we can't just imagine a better future we've got to fight for it we've got to out hustle the other side we've got to work the other side we've got to vote like never before and leave no doubt so make a plan right now for how you're going to get involved and vote do it as early as you can tell your family tell your friends how they can vote don't stop with joe and kamala make sure you vote all the way down the ticket and if we pour all our efforts into these 13 days if we vote up and down the ticket like never before then we will not only elect joe biden and kamala harris we will also leave no doubt about what this country that we love stands for we will not leave any doubt about who we are as a people and the values and ideals that we embrace what lincoln called the better angels of our nature those are still in us we see him operating every single day we see him in neighborhoods we see him in churches and synagogues and mosques and temples we see him in people helping out a neighbor we see him inside our own families we see that what is best in us is still there but we've got to give it voice and we've got to do it now so let's get to work people let's bring this home i love you philadelphia,b hello philadelphia applause man PRON be good to be back in pennsylvania what beautiful weather PRON get here a little indian summer PRON know i know the president spend some time in

constitution center and i be deliver a speech for the democratic national convention this year and i say during that speech PRON have sit in the oval office with both of the man who be run for president and PRON be very different people i explain that i never think donald trump would embrace PRON vision or continue PRON policy but i do hope for the sake of the country that PRON may show some interest in take the job seriously but PRON have not happen PRON have not show any interest in do the work or help anybody but PRON and PRON friend or treat the presidency like a reality show that PRON can use to get attention and by the way even then PRON tv rating be down so PRON know that upset but the thing be this be not a reality show this be reality and the rest of PRON have have to live with the consequence of PRON prove PRON incapable of take the job seriously at least americans have die more than small business have close million of job be go PRON proud reputation around the world be in tatter president up for re election usually ask if the country be well off than PRON be four year ago PRON will tell PRON one thing four year ago PRON would be tailgate here at the link instead of watch a speech from PRON car the only people truly better off than PRON be four year ago be the billionaire who get PRON tax cut right now as PRON speak trump will not even extend relief to the million of family who be have trouble pay the rent or put food on the table because of this pandemic but PRON be be do all right by PRON as PRON turn out this be just report in the last hour PRON know that PRON continue to do business with china because PRON be get a secret chinese bank account how be that possible how be that possible a secret chinese bank account listen can PRON imagine if i have a secret chinese bank account when i be run for reelection PRON think PRON think PRON PRON think fox news may have be a little concerned about that PRON would have call PRON beijing barry PRON be not a great idea to have a president who owe a bunch of money to people overseas that be that be not a good idea i mean of the taxis donald trump pay PRON may be send more to foreign government than PRON pay in the united states PRON first year in the white house PRON only pay dollar in federal income tax listen PRON first job be at a baskin robbin when i be year old i think i may have pay more taxis that year work at a dispense ice cream how be that possible how many people here pay less than that PRON be possible just possible now that if if PRON be live high on the hog and PRON only pay dollar in taxis that maybe just maybe PRON may not know what work people be go through here in pennsylvania PRON can not afford four more year of this philadelphia but the good news be right now PRON can choose change right now PRON can vote for PRON friend joe biden and PRON running mate kamala harris as the next president and vice president of the united states of america now joe joe no stranger to PRON PRON be a native son scrappy kid from scranton PRON know PRON and PRON know PRON know PRON but let PRON let PRON tell PRON how i come to know PRON and and how i come to love PRON year ago when i choose when i choose joe biden as vice president as as PRON vice presidential run bait i do not know joe all that well PRON have serve in the senate together but PRON be not super close PRON and i come from different place PRON come from different generation but i come to admire joe as a man who have learn early on to treat everybody PRON meet with dignity and respect live by the word PRON parent teach PRON no one be well than PRON joe but PRON be well than nobody and that empathy that decency that belief that everybody count that be who joe be that be who PRON will be and i can tell PRON the presidency do not change who PRON be PRON reveal who PRON be and joe have show PRON to be a friend of work people for eight year joe be the last one in the room when i face a big decision PRON make PRON a well president and PRON be get the character and experience to make PRON a well country and PRON and kamala be go to be in the fight not for PRON but for every single one of PRON look i get that this president want full credit for the economy PRON inherit and zero blame for the pandemic that PRON ignore but PRON know what the job do not work that way tweet at the television do not fix thing make stuff up do not make people life well PRON have get to have a plan PRON have get to put in the work and along with the experience to get thing do joe biden have concrete plan and policy that will turn PRON vision of a better fair strong country into a reality literally leave this white house a pandemic playbook that would have show PRON how to respond before the virus reach PRON shore PRON probably use PRON to i do not know prop up a wobbly table somewhere PRON do not know where that playbook go eight month into this pandemic case be rise again across this country donald trump be not suddenly go to protect all of PRON PRON can not even take the basic step to protect PRON just last night PRON complain up in erie that the pandemic make PRON go back to work PRON be quote here PRON be PRON be upset that the pandemic make PRON go back to work if PRON would actually be work the whole time PRON never would have get this bad so look here be the truth i want to be honest here this pandemic would have be challenge for any president but this idea that somehow this white house have do anything but completely screw this up be just not true PRON will give PRON a very specific example korea identify PRON first case at the same time that the united states do at the same time PRON per capita death toll be just percent of what ours be in canada PRON be just percent of what ours be other country be still struggle with the pandemic but PRON be not do as bad as PRON be because PRON have get a government that be actually be pay attention and that mean life lose and that mean an economy that do not work and just yesterday when ask if PRON would do anything differently trump say not much really not much nothing PRON can think of that could have help some people keep PRON love one alive so joe be not go to screw up test PRON be not go to call scientist idiot PRON be not go to host a super spreader event at the white house joe will get this pandemic under control with a plan to make testing free and widely available to get a vaccine to every american cost free and to make sure PRON front line hero never ask other country for the equipment PRON need PRON plan will guarantee pay sick leave for worker and parent affect by the pandemic and make sure that the small business that hold PRON community together and employ million of americans can reopen safely PRON know donald donald trump like to claim PRON build this economy but america create million more job in the last three year of the obama biden administration than in the first three year of the trump pence administration how PRON figure that and that be before PRON could blame the pandemic now PRON do inherit the long streak of job growth in american history but just like everything else PRON inherit PRON mess PRON up the economic damage PRON inflict by botch the pandemic response mean PRON will be the first president since herbert hoover to actually lose job joe get a plan to create million good clean energy job as part of a historic two trillion dollar investment to fight climate change to secure environmental justice and PRON will pay PRON will pay for PRON by roll back that tax cut for billionaire and joe see this moment not just as a chance to get back to where PRON be but to finally make long overdue change so that PRON economy actually make life a little easy for everybody the waitress try to raise PRON kid on PRON own the student try to figure out how to pay for next semester class the shift worker who be always on the edge of get lay off the cancer survivor who be worried about PRON pre existing condition protection be take away let PRON tell PRON say pennsylvania this i know to be true joe and kamala will protect PRON health care and expand medicare and make insurance more affordable for everybody PRON know republicans love to say right before an election that PRON will protect PRON pre existing condition now joe and i actually protect PRON policy to make sure people with pre existing condition could get health insurance and have coverage PRON do PRON through something call the affordable care act aka obamacare and republicans try to repeal or undermine PRON more than time and when PRON have be ask about PRON PRON keep on promise PRON be go to have a great replacement PRON say PRON be come PRON be be come in two week for the last year where be PRON where be this great plan to replace obamacare PRON have have year to do PRON there be no plan PRON have never have one instead PRON have attack the affordable care act at every turn drive up cost drive up the uninsured now PRON be try to dismantle PRON care in the supreme court as PRON speak as quickly as PRON can in the middle of a pandemic with nothing but empty promise to take PRON place PRON be shameful the idea that PRON would take health care away from people at the very moment where people need PRON most what be the logic of that there be no logic joe know that a first the first job of a president be to keep PRON safe from all threat foreign domestic or microscopic when the daily intelligence briefing flash warning sign about a virus a president can not ignore PRON PRON can not be awol just like when russia put bounty on the head of PRON soldier in afghanistan the commander in chief can not be miss an action i i can tell PRON this joe biden would never call the man and woman of PRON military sucker or loser who do that PRON know these these hero be somebody child somebody spouse somebody dad or mom PRON understand that and PRON be go to restore PRON standing in the world because PRON know that america true strength come from set an example that the world want to follow a nation that stand with democracy not dictator a nation that can mobilize and inspire other to overcome threat like climate change and terrorism and poverty and disease and with joe and kamala at the helm PRON be not go to have to think about the crazy thing PRON say every day and that

who run medicaid right now be do PRON good to kick people off of medicaid instead of sign PRON up for medicaid come on when joe and kamala be in charge PRON be not go to surround PRON with hack and lobbyist but PRON be go to appoint qualified public servant who actually care about look out for PRON for PRON job for PRON family for PRON health for PRON security for PRON planet and that more than anything be what separate PRON from PRON opponent PRON actually care about every american include the one that do not agree with PRON and PRON be go to fight for PRON every day PRON care about PRON

get joe biden and kamala harris in the white house and a house and senate that be focus on work people PRON can make a difference and get million of people the help PRON need a president by PRON can not eliminate all racial bias in PRON criminal justice system but if PRON have get district attorney and state attorney and sheriff and police chief focus on equality and justice PRON can make thing better in pennsylvania PRON just get to flip nine seat in PRON state house just five seat in PRON state senate to give democrats control and new life for policy PRON will make a real difference to work family right now PRON can make thing well and and PRON in the end pennsylvania that be what voting be about make thing better not make thing perfect but put PRON on track so that a generation from now PRON can look back and say thing get better start now and that be what be vote be about voting be about use the power PRON have and pool PRON together to get a government that be more

people who could be vote vote PRON get percent of people vote and then people say oh look PRON know not enough change happen well imagine what would happen at percent vote what about percent imagine january th when PRON swear in a president and a vice president who have a plan to get PRON out of this mess who believe in science and have a plan to protect this planet for PRON kid and who care about work americans and have a plan to help PRON start get ahead and who believe in racial equality and gender equality and and believe in not discriminate against people because of PRON sexual orientation and be willing to bring PRON closer to an america where no matter what PRON look like and where PRON come from and who PRON love and what PRON last name be if PRON go out there and PRON work PRON can make PRON and PRON be part of an american family all of that be possible all of that be within PRON reach if PRON vote because let PRON tell PRON something pennsylvania some people ask PRON sometimes PRON say man how have PRON be able to take these last four year just watch all this how do PRON how do PRON keep PRON spirit up and and i tell PRON i say look for all the time these
