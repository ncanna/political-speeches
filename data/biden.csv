I'm known back home at home though most places thank you a nice and before I begin what I want to do is I want to take a moment quite frankly to reflect on something that happened here in the state not long ago a matter of fact very recently and the reflects on the anti-semitic attack that took place this weekend and in Poway synagogue in California one dead three injured but folks we saw hate in Charlottesville we saw it again in Pittsburgh at the Tree of Life synagogue and the attack of the deadliest and American history on a Jewish community and we're reminded again that then we are in a battle we are in a battle for America's soul I really believe that and we have to restore it so folks want to thank rich Fitzgerald the county executive of Allegheny County executor being here in and mayor mayor Nesby city of Duquesne is here as well all right they're somewhere in there I got to see it the International firefighters general president and my friend for a long long time one of the guys in the unions that as they say along with the teachers brung me to the day it's [Music] [Applause] thank you for your endorsement and Kevin Schmidt president Teamsters Local here thanks for the for the use of the house I appreciate it the president of firefighters Dave were you the pennsylvania firefighters dave thank you very much and also a real union that helped me in the very very beginning in my career and I have a great respect for the United Steelworkers Bobby Bobby Mac [Applause] and the building trades Frank worth Frank's here too so look you've got a pal look I the Pennsylvania Federation of Teachers the Pennsylvania State Education Association American Federation of government employees afte unite brother the Carpenters Service Employees Union SEIU United Food and Commercial Workers by the way I make no apologies I am a union man or Battaglia let me touch thank you thank you thank you let me tell you why thank you let me tell you why I chose Pittsburgh to begin this effort I believe that Pittsburgh and my native town of Scranton in my hometown of Wilmington and Claymont they represents the cities and towns have made up make up hard-working middle-class Americans who are the backbone of this nation that's the hyperbole the backbone of this nation I also I also came here because quite frankly folks if I'm going to be able to beat Donald Trump in 2020 it's going to happen here with your help able to do that well with your help with your help I think we're gonna be able to do that we're going to be able to do it in Pennsylvania western Pennsylvania Northeast Pennsylvania places we're a little lately we've had a little bit of a struggle but the truth of the matter is I think I think we're coming back so please please go to Joe Biden dot-com and sign up and enjoy our campaign we need your help we need your help folks there are three basic reasons why I'm running for president united states the first is restore the soul of the nation and the second is to rebuild the back mode of this nation then the third is to unify this nation we always do better react as one America today today I want to speak about the second of these three and that's rebuilding the back mode of America and that is that we have time all my time in public life for this I've gotten involved I've been referred to as middle-class Joe it's not always men as a compliment it's usually that I'm not sophisticated that's why I middle-class Joe but the fact of the matter is I'm awfully sophisticated about why Howard who built this country let me say this simply and clearly and I mean this the country wasn't built by Wall Street bankers CEOs and hutch and hedge fund man it was built by you was built by the great American middle class an American American load class is built by unions by you look folks you know that's the story of America when ordinary people from neighborhoods like yours of mine we grew up go out and do extraordinary things that's how it's happened when I look out at this crowd I see the folks in my neighborhood and Claymont and Wilmington and Scranton and I'm not being solicitous I mean it I see people with physical courage and brains I see people have busted their backs their whole lives to care for their families I see people like the millions of people across this nation who got up every single day go out work like the devil to raise their families pay their taxes volunteer in their communities to make this country work I see people understand that being middle class is not a number it's a value set it's being able to send your kid to a park where you know their income safely's being able own your own home and not just at the rent it's being able it it's being able to send your kid to a good school and if they do well they can go beyond high school to trade school or college or beyond it's about being able to take care of your geriatric mom when your dad passes and hope your children never have to take care of you because you've earned a solid and decent retirement that's no class [Applause] that's not asking a lot [Applause] everybody knows it the middle class is hurting it's hurting now 53% of the folks in America don't think their children gonna have the same standard living they had the best of my knowledge that's the first time that's happened in the law long long time the stock market is roaring but you don't feel it there's two trillion dollar tax cut like last year did you feel it did you get anything from it of course not of course not all it went to folks at the top in corporations that pay no taxes the number of corporations that paid no taxes now has doubled since that tech look guys this is not good what's happened here has happened for a lot of different reasons but for me one of them stands out the basic bargain used to exist that Democrats and Republicans used to agree to has been broken and that is you contribute to the welfare the enterprise you work for you got to share in the benefits and the profits if the enterprises hard times everybody took a hit up and down the line from the secretary to the CEO but that bargains been broken now the only people benefit of what a company does well are the CEOs and the shareholders the people at the top no only people get hurt when a company gets hit by hard times our workers it's a one-way street these days just look around GM I worked like the devil to see to the GM who stayed alive at the White House union workers the UAW took incredible cuts in their future and their pensions of the left to get GM working to keep it alive the taxpayers bailed them out they paid it back and paid it back that with interest but what happened where the CEOs the executives the one who did quite well and the second the second they hit hard times what they do they close plants the announced they're going to layoff or transfer 14,000 workers they also got that last year over a hundred ninety-two million dollars in tax breaks they could have given everyone they laid off severance pay if they had dude couldn't give everyone they did nothing they brought back their stock raised their benefits raised their salaries announced they were going to build our new truck in Mexico folks folks know I look I just did a rally for the for the United Food and Commercial Workers in Boston 31,000 workers went on strike to protect their wages health care benefits and retirement benefits we'll stop and shop in trouble no the prayer company had made two billion dollars a year before two billion dollars that's what they do they were going to decide that notwithstanding that they're gonna buy back their stock and try to cut wages or freeze wages for their people it's not right now here UPMC UPMC one of the largest employers in this state no but I think people have to understand this you understand it the SEIU is engaged one of the most important organizing fights in this country folks what was 200 years ago in steel mills and coal mines is true today in our big Hospital systems right today the same is happening in big hospitals and big hospital systems and it's going to take a strong union to get justice for healthcare workers you know so un-pc stop the union-busting stop stop trying to keep your working organized but I want to know um PC workers I am with you I'm in the back in the mind president I will fight like the devil to make sure you are not blocked unions are not blocked unfairly by this it's economically wrong and it's morally wrong so what do we do folks I think we have to I have yet to rethink how we define what constitutes a successful economy it's not enough for the stock market arise that's not a bad thing but it's just not enough workers feel powerless and too often humiliated I call it an abuse of power and I can't stand it never have been able to when I think about work I think about dignity I think about a lot about my dad a proud gentle man my dad had an expression he said Joey a job is about a lot more than a paycheck it's about your dignity it's about respect it's about your place in the community it's about being able to look at your kid and say honey it's gonna be okay and meaning her but folks too many people they can't look at their kids today it's gonna be okay and mean it and that's what we got to change I think about so many people across this country today who are just not getting respect now treat it with respect how do you get to a place how do we ever get here where people who teach our kids take care of our sick transport our goods build our bridges and repair our grooves keep our water systems safe people who race into burning buildings people who race into danger to protect us people who pick up our garbage off our streets iron workers steel workers Boilermakers plumbers electrical workers salespeople how do we get to this place where they don't think we see them or hear them or know them and maybe most importantly respect them respect [Applause] [Music] I think the question today is how do we get here how did it happen what are you gonna do about it all across America communities are hurting with too many people left out or left behind our political system is broken we're tearing America apart instead of lifting it up and the major in my view the major moral obligation of our time is to restore rebuild and respect the backbone of America the middle class as we rebuild it we need this rebuilding to be all inclusive opening the doors to opportunity for all Americans no matter their race their gender who they love no matter who or where they're from no matter whether or not they have a disability all America has to be included as we rebuild Oh [Applause] and I guarantee you this is remain and will be my measure what constitutes economic success the dignity of work is my measure which is about being able to provide security and share the joys with your families how can a person dignity be maintained if they can't afford to care for the sick child or a family member because of a pre-existing condition or because they they've reached the point where their health care has run out and the insurance company says no more Jill and I and my family like many of you went through a year knowing our son was terminally ill I could not imagine what it'd be like if we were told that he'd run out of the amount of money an insurance policy and they're gonna have to cut him off of the palliative care he was getting my lord think about it how can a parent maintain the dignity their dignity if their talent and qualified child wants to go beyond high school trade school community college or college and they can't afford it how do you get in there folks it's not just that that that child is not going to have an opportunity to grow and be better but think about it think about it I'll never forget the day my senior in high school and my going down to my dad's office to borrow a car for the prom driving down an old car to pick up a car from the senior prom and I asked secretary where he was she said he's out in the alley they're hunting behind the behind the office and I walked out my dad was a gentle decent man I was pacing back and forth it's absolutely guarantee a true story I walked in he said Joey I'm sorry I'm so sorry and I thought my god what happened to some happened a mom or my brothers or sisters before cellphones I said I said what's the matter dad he said I went to the bank on you today to try to borrow money to help me get to school but they won't lend it to me I'm so ashamed how many people in America today are in that situation hard-working decent people because the cost of education is skyrocketing so battling and access is so difficult folks dignity monocot the philosopher said dignity the definition of dignity is that people should never be treated as a means to an end but an end in themselves that's how today's corporate culture works CEOs and this administration sees a different way they see workers resistant means to an end not the end and in themselves and themselves look at look at the record they treat their employees in a way that it's only about how can they maximize their profit not how can they maximize the circumstance for the employees who help them build the operation they're squeezing the life out of workers you know when you look under the hood of the labor market you see how tough it is for workers to negotiate I don't have to tell you Union folks that you see how companies have become so adept at squeezing every last penny out of their payroll how good they become a tilting the scales in their favor but it's not only making it harder for harder and harder to meet our basic needs they're doing it across the board not only stripping away the union's rights to negotiate but your personal dignity just take a look I'm not only going after labor and unions to try to take away and diminish the right to bargain they're going after individuals all to suppress their wages to realize that why on earth of the sandwich worker an hourly worker making sandwiches have to sign a non-compete clause promise I will not compete with this already because and I know we laugh about it but here's the deal guys they can't go across town to another sandwich place and get a 15 cent raise if they could they can't even advertise themselves they can't move because why all to suppress wages all to suppress wages you have seen these agreements at least once during the career 40 million or 40 percent of them it's wrong it's immoral and it should be made illegal in the states where they try to do it [Applause] but they're doing the same thing with occupational licenses why should someone who braids there have to get 600 hours of training it makes no sense it's designed to keep the competition down look folks you can't just transfer your licenses across one state to another they're making it harder and harder in a whole range of professions all to keep competition down why should we get rid of these unnecessary hoops out there because we have to restore America's ability and individuals Americans to be able to fight for their own dignity you know we should stop companies from classifying low-wage workers as managers you see it all the time we tried in our administration be sure why they do that so they have to pay overtime it costs more than four million workers last year 1.2 billion dollars in lost overtime pay reclassification and by the way speaking of overtime it's well past time that the minimum wage nationally be a minimum of $15 [Applause] time to start rewarding work over wealth just the first step is reversed president Trump's tax cut for the very wealthy in corporation we need to eliminate these special tax breaks in the tax code that reward special interest let's get rid of capital gains loopholes for multimillionaires Warren Buffett said at best he should not pay a lower tax rate than the Secretary has faced well that's because the capital gains it's wrong I'm going to change that so millionaires and billionaires don't pay lower taxes than firefighters teachers and I go on and on we need to reward work in this country not just well there's much more we knew there's much more we need to do to build a middle class in the coming weeks I'm learning a great deal more detail about this but you've been standing too long look it starts with access to affordable education so that everyone can get the skills they need twelve twelve years of education in the 21st century is not enough simple but it's got to be affordable 65 and over 100 jobs today require training beyond high school sixty-five out of every 100 but what we have to make it post-secondary education add trim make training affordable make sure it employs the economy works not just for the wealthy forks not just for people who get to four-year college degrees but those who compete for job training and trades and programs look guys we can do all this it means being able may have a quality health care care for all Americans affordable health care was a huge step forward the ACA in our country we made historic progress [Applause] by extending healthcare to 22 million people Americans who didn't have it before or now have it 22 million we have to stop this administration's effort to gut it first and then we have to move on and finish the job and make health care make health care right health care is a right not a privilege [Applause] you have to give everybody 50 cent mind they deserve what you're coming in through your employer on your own or not you all should have a choice to be able to buy into a public option plan for Medicare your choice and the insurance company isn't doing the right thing by you should have another choice it means rebuilding America's clean renewable energy cleaner safer faster transportation will not only make us safer and make our terrific our children go to provide millions of good-paying middle-class jobs it means investing much more in medical research to comfort to conquer devastating diseases like cancer in addiction and Alzheimer's we have the ability to do that invest in it look folks we can do all of us without punishing anybody you know when Reagan was president there were eight hundred billion dollars in tax expenditures meaning tax loopholes notice today it's over one trillion six hundred billion we could send everyone in America to a community college for free six million folks six million folks knew by doing one thing eliminating one loophole of the one trillion six hundred billion and only it robs the country's seventeen billion dollars a year it's called stepped-up basis it's a fancy way if you get a capital gain you're about to go cash it in god forbid you did buy a truck you leave it to your child they pay no tax it's not an inheritance tax and sixteen billion dollars 17 billion dollars old five minutes earlier if you eliminate that one you could put every cut college cost in half and you could in fact in fact have eleven billion dollars left to reduce the devil so folks quite frankly only these stands in our way is our broken political system that's deliberately being undermined by our president to continue to abuse the power of the office Donald Trump is only president is the only president who's decided not to represent the whole country the president has his base we need a president who works for all Americans when we can afford this we can do this and I'm optimistic for two reasons one I know the issue the journey of this country when ordinary Americans like my family give another even chance just an even chance they do extraordinary things they have never ever ever let the country down and the second reason I'm optimistic is that I know we are better positioned than any nation in the world to own the 21st century we not only have the strongest military in the world we have the most productive workers in the world three times as productive workers in Asia North American energy makes us independent the US has been us has more great research university where all these major breakthroughs come from than all the rest of the world combined no other nation in the world can match us we can we can bring and be a positive force for everyone folks nothing's beyond our capacity the only thing that can tear America part is America itself but folks everybody knows who Donald Trump is and I believe I believe in hope they know who we are we have to let them know who we are we Democrats and we independents who had the same view have to choose hope over fear unity over division maybe most importantly truth over lives [Applause] time this time [Applause] it's time to think of our heads remember who we are this is the United States of America there is not a single thing beyond our capacity not a single thing so god bless you all and may God protect our troops

3,u-AEAq7jzcU,biden,2019-05-18T19:53:18Z,Joe Biden speaks during a campaign rally in Philadelphia,speech,so let's do this please welcome my husband Joe [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] Oh coming up [Applause] thank you thank you thank you [Applause] thank you thank you thank you thank you [Applause] folks thank you Jim [Applause] I'm Joe Biden and I'm Jill's husband you all think I'm kidding that's how I'm identified everyone knows Julie's a Philadelphia girl she loves this city I do too but to paraphrase the poet James Joyce I have to say this folks because I'm near my state when I die Delaware all written on my heart look I'm mildly prejudiced but I think she made a great great second lady and she's going to make one heck of a first lady folks in the past few weeks I've been all across America Pittsburgh Iowa South Carolina Nevada California New Hampshire and today Philadelphia this campaign is just getting started and I promise you this no one no one's going to work longer no one's going to campaign harder to win your hearts your trust and your support than the son of Catherine Eugenia fitting from Scranton Pennsylvania Joseph R Biden Jr so those are list if you wanna be part of this campaign pick up your phones pick up your phones now send a text to the word United to the number 303 300k that's United 303 304 303 3 300 voi a way but you got it it's on the back there so look look it's a logical question that people asked why we'd begin this journey in this place this great city of Philadelphia well there's a simple reason there's a simple reason because that's let it let it let it go that's not how we do it other campaigns do it this way we don't do it you will not hear me speaker I made a pledge I mean it sincerely I made a pledge you will not hear me speak ill of another Democrat look these over here is because in a literal sense this was the birthplace of our democracy it was it was here over tooth you know the fact is two of the most important documents not only in our history but the history of the world were written right here in 1776 the Declaration of Independence we hold these truths to be self-evident these words these words are the basis for the American cream equality equity fairness decency America didn't live up to that promise for most of the people at the time a prompt the people of color of whip for women but we were bored of an idea that every single solitary person given half a chance no matter where they're from given half a chance there's not a single thing they cannot do if they work at it nothing's beyond their capacity that's who we are then in eighteen eighteen eighty seven 1787 the United States Constitution we we the people this words changed everything power rested to the people not the government freedom to think to speak to act to criticize your government all protected we we became the model for the world in both documents there's a singular word we we hold these truths elf evidence we the people both both and we got to remember this both were statements of a common purpose a common purpose of one people one nation our Constitution doesn't begin with the phrase we the Democrats and we the Republicans and it certainly doesn't begin with the phrase we the donors look you began with a phrase that stands for we are all in this together we need to remember that today I think more than any time in my career our politics has become so mean so petty so negative so partisan so angry and so unproductive so unproductive instead of debating our opponents we demonize them instead of questioning judgments we question their motives instead of listening we shout instead of looking for solutions we look to score political points but no more no more because this politics this politics is pulling us apart it's ripping this country apart of the seams our politicians our politics today traffics and division and our president is the divider in chief look but he's not the only one far from him he's just the worst practitioner of politics that singles out scapegoats and demonizes he holds out the other as a source of all their problems you hear it the immigrant the Muslim anyone different and creed or color conviction they're the problem that's what he says that's been the scheme used by unscrupulous politicians for decades but it comes at a gigantic cost I mean this to the bottom art it comes as a gigantic cost it weakens us it distracts us it divides us it causes us to lose credibility around the world you know it picks it the wound and it solves nothing this is not who we are this is not who we are and I absolutely refuse [Applause] to accept the notion that that's what we have to do folks in this country we're all bound together in this great experiment of equality and opportunity and decency we haven't lived up but we've never given up on it everyone and I mean everyone everyone is in on the deal that's why we've been the beacon of hope for the rest of the world that's why the world has always looked at us that must be burning or somebody I don't know who that is America is unique in all the world American folks is an idea an idea stronger than any army bigger than any ocean were powerful any dictator retirement it offers hope to the tire the poor your huddled masses to breathe free what's written on the Statue of Liberty we seem to be given up on it America guarantees everyone and I mean everyone be treated with dignity America gives hate no safe harbor that's what we believe that's who we are I believe America has always been it is best when America is acted as one American one American one America maybe a simple notion but it doesn't it doesn't make it any less profound this nation needs to come together it has to come together folks we started this campaign what we did I said I was running for three reasons the first is to restore the soul of the nation yes it's of who we are in the second is to rebuild the backbone of this nation and the third to unite this nation one America one America folks I know some of the really smart folks say Democrats don't want to hear about unity they say Democrats are so angry that the anger candidate can be the better chance he or she has to win the Democratic nomination well I don't believe it I really don't if Democrats I believe Democrats want to unify this nation that's what our party's always been about that's how it's always been about unity if the American people want a president to add to our division lead with a clenched fist a closed hand a hard heart to demonize your opponents to spew hatred they don't need me they've got President Donald Trump I'm runnin or for our country Democrats Republicans and independents a different path not back to a path that never was but to a future that fulfills our true potential as a country now some of these same people are saying you know Biden just doesn't get it you can't work with Republicans anymore that's not the way it works anymore well folks I'm gonna say something outrageous I know how to make government work not not because I've talked to tweeted about it but because I've done it I've worked across the aisle to reach consensus he'll make government work in the past I can do that again with your help for being for babe to me our principles must never be compromised but compromise itself is not a dirty word consensus is not a weakness it's the only where our founders down the road there thought it was the wrong way we could govern it was necessary it was designed the way the Constitution says it requires consensus you know I did it when I was a senator it's what I did is your vice president to work with Barack Obama and it's what I will do as your president let me be real clear everybody listening Democrats and Republicans if I'm elected your president I'm going to do whatever it takes to make progress on the matters that matter most civil liberties Civil Rights voting rights women's right to choose national security first mr. Koerner health care an economy during words work not just well a climate change policy that will save our children and grandchildren and this planet I know there are time I know there are times there's only a bare-knuckle fight will do I know we have to take on Republicans to do what's right without any help from them that's what it took to pass the Affordable Care Act that was a tough fight then it was a big a big deal which reminds me and maybe we should step back and say something we don't often say enough as a party as a nation Barack Obama was an extraordinary man I watched up close he has character courage vision he was the president our children could and did look up to he's a great presence and I was proud to serve as his vice president but never more proud than the day we passed health care health care a lot of presidents before tried it other administration's have not been able to do it but it was done by Barack Obama without a single Republican vote so I know how to get things done helping I know how to go toe-to-toe with the GOP but it doesn't have to be and it can't be that way on every single issue look at the Recovery Act the Recovery Act the cornerstone of the nation's economic recovery from the depths of the greatest financial crisis short of a depression that we ever faced in our history and that's a big reason big reason we now have had 10 years of uninterrupted economic growth what we needed we needed to find three Republicans the United States Senate to get it passed it was my job to find them persuade them I did they did and the country did better than it has before one more one more aside I know President Trump likes to take credit for the economy and the economic growth and the low unemployment numbers but just look with the facts not the alternative facts president Trump for her inherited an economy from obama-biden administration that was given to him just like he'd heard at everything else in his life just like just like everything else he's been given in his life these are the process of squandering that as well [Applause] Recovery Act help save this nation from economic growing to get - get down - get down - we'd had to get the work done we had to bring a few Republicans along and if we hadn't done it we could have had another great depression or economic ruin so folks working together matters it matters the American people want the government to work and I don't think that's too much for them to ask you know I know some people in DC say it can't be done well let me tell them something but make sure they understand this the country is sick of the division they're sick of the fighting they're sick of the childish behavior where's it a single person among you or anywhere in this country could get away that in their jobs all they want us through their president their senators that represented to do their jobs just do your job and folks above all have a president a president who measures his or her days by the people he brings together rather than the vision that he sews look folks you all know as well as I do you wouldn't be here you know they're serious work that has to be done but it's not being done by a president who wakes up in the middle of the night and wages of war intruder or like the guy in the whistle back there one who's campaign he's with [Applause] while he's lashing out as his political opponents obsessing over his personal grievances look the rest is the most important thing to remember the rest of the world in wait he didn't wait he Chinese and waiting third building 5g mastering AI they're rewriting the rules of the Internet they're moving into areas that should not be abandoned by us the rest of the world hasn't given up on the Paris climate Accord they're pushing it they know it's essential to human existence the greatest challenges we face in the future will be over technology intellectual property clean energy a warming planet there's not a single thing that building the wall or imposing and imposing another tariff can address on any of these issues folks we need a 21st century strategy for America but every tool that Donald Trump uses is out of the past folks we have to get focused focused on the future it's the only way we're going to invest in education educational system our people need to succeed in the 21st century Jill always says she's a community college professor she always says any country that out-educates us will out-compete us that's just a natural fact and folks that success will come when we generate free community colleges investing job training and apprenticeship continuing education allowing people to fill jobs in the future a stronger commitment to pre-k and so much more folks we know it works we know we have to do so let's stop fighting and start fixing I need you oh we all know the Affordable Care Act was a historic achievement 20 million Americans got coverage over a hundred million people with pre-existing conditions could no longer be denied coverage restore dignity for the parents who couldn't afford to take care of the children's health care and now we need to go to the next step we shouldn't start over and we shouldn't we surely shouldn't tear it down to me giving every American every American the right to choose a public option like Medicare is the best way to get everybody if they choose focusing on the future it's the only way we're gonna be able to build a new green infrastructure not only new and safer roads and bridges but greener highways ports and also our airports we can make them greener and more rational we can do a lot water systems where no one in this country has to drink poison water and there's no question there's no question to use your electric gray that protects this nation from cyberattack that is able to transmit solar and and wind energy across those same lines folks we know what we have to do that's why I'm running as I said let's stop fighting and start fixing and we can only do it together oops it's the only way we're going to deal with the existential crisis posed by climate change there's not much time left we need a clean energy revolution we needed now we have to start now we have to move all over the garden built and by the way we have to stop the thinking the clean energy and job creation don't go together they do they do we need to set the most impressive goal as possible but folks we have to work together to get it done look we're never convinced the climate deniers or those special interests but even now some of those special interests the traditional polluters are realizing gas and oil industry automobile manufacturers guess what they're saying on television other mr. president you got to do something about global warming the other loyal industry because they're gonna be underwater not a joke not a joke the automobile industry they agreed when Barack and I came along and said we're gonna double the cafe standard they thought it was a good idea they didn't even agree with the president when he rolled it back what in God who's he trying to please folks we need a president willing to lead who insist on dramatic change for the sake of our children folks let me tell you something this fable most important thing we have to accomplish to get this done the single most important thing we have to accomplish is defeat Donald Trump Oh [Applause] Oh as long as Donald Trump's in the White House as long as Donald Trump's an White House one of these things these critical things are gonna get done so if you want to know what the first and most important plant in my climate proposal is beat Trump there's one thing we need to remember one thing I just discussed so maybe everything I just discussed some education to infrastructure the healthcare to climate there's an overwhelming agreement among the American people what should be done that's true he doesn't but people are not divided it's our politics is divided and that gap and that gap that's causing the failure to act it's giving rise to the worst elements in our society people coming out from under the rocks out of fields carrying the torches folks it asked me a few years ago if our democracy was at stake I would have smiled and laughed a little bit but no more no more a threat to this nation to our democracy is real it's clear in his prison you've watched the president now for three years look at what he's doing instilling fear I mean not not joking instilling fear sowing division stroking racial division undercutting every institution that was designed to check the abuse of power by the President or anyone else all this for what reason all this in order to solidify his base and expand his power think about it now really think about this there's real honest attacks on the Free Press fake news the enemy of the people they're nothing to be dismissed tyrants and dictators all over the world are using the same language to stifle dissent is solidify their own power in their country his attack on the independence of courts saying you cannot trust the judge because of his Mexican Angus ancestor no I'm by the way if I made this speech here ten years ago you'd laugh at me say that's not gonna have that can't be America that can't be in America president democrat or republican folks his attack on the co-equal branch of government to Congress blocking their constitutional responsibility to legitimately engage in oversight placing him above the law and by the way without a whimper from the Republicans of Congress who know better they know better they know better folks these things are corrosive they threaten the core values of this nation they undermine not kidding me they undermine our standing around the world everything that amazed has made America America is it risk let me ask you a we a nation that believes there's a moral equivalence between right supremacist neo Nazis the Ku Klux Klan and those were the courage to stand against them we don't but Trump does Trump said there was a moral equivalence a we nation that believes ripping children from the arms of their parents at the border no we don't but Trump does are we a nation that embraces dictators and tyrants like Putin and Kim Jong un truc does look every day we're reminded about this in this election about we have to be remembered who we are what we stand for what we believe and every day we're reminded there's nothing guaranteed about our democracy we have to fight someone we have to defend it we have to earn it [Applause] we stay here okay I'm only 140 miles from Gettysburg perhaps the most famous symbol in our nation's history of the cost of division in this Gettysburg Address Lincoln didn't only honor the bravery of those who lost their lives at Gettysburg she had a message for the living who said it is for us to be dedicated to the great task remaining before us that a government of by and for the people shall not perish from the earth that wasn't just a power from Lincoln for those presents a challenge he handed down to every generation of Americans to follow now that challenge has been handed to us and it's the test above all others that future generations America will measure us by will we be the ones to let the government of by and for the people perish from the face of the earth happen dare we let that happen absolutely not we will not I will not you OMA the promise in this nation our standings the beacon hook of the world will not be extinguished on my watch or yours [Applause] here's the amazing thing about the mug this moment in history on the one hand we're facing the biggest threat any of us that this bount gathered in his field in this beautiful place any of us have faced in our entire lifetimes but on the other hand on the other hand we've never had a future that's more promising I've said it many times I'm more optimistic about America's future today than when I was got it when I got elected not young enough to be sworn in as a United States Senator age 29 here's why folks we are better positioned than any nation in the world to lead the 21st century and as I've traveled the world and met with almost most of the world leaders they know it without us they can't lead our workers are three times as productive as workers in Asia that's a fact number one we have the biggest economy in the world we're the strongest military in the history of the world we have the most innovative entrepreneurs where virtually energy-independent we have we have more great research universities in this city this state this country than all the world combined that's a fact no other nation no nation can matter if we step up we need by the power our example not by the example of our power the only thing you can tear America part is America itself and we can't not let that happen well everybody knows who Donald Trump is even as supporters know we yes but I have to let you know here's the deal we have to let them know who we are what we stand for we choose hope over fear truth over lives and yes unity over division so folks it's time for us to lift our heads up open our hearts remember who we are we are the United States of America not a single thing we cannot do if we do it together god bless you all and may God protect our troops [Applause],b so let PRON

12,OFvx5F1yM-g,biden,2019-08-07T21:43:53Z,Full Speech: Biden Condemns Trump’s Rhetoric And White Nationalism | NBC News,speech,folks thank you very very much for being here and giving me this opportunity I say at the outset that the speech I'm going to give you today I plan on coming when we set this up some weeks ago and talked about Agricultural Policy union's rule policy etc but too much has happened in the recent past and I have prepared for me what is a speech that I hope will set a marker for what we should be doing you all know the words of a president matters they can move markets they can send our brave women of men to war they can bring peace they can calm a nation in turmoil they can console and confront and comfort those who have faced tragedy they can inspire us looting to reach for the moon they can encourage us to appeal to our better angels to a better nature but they can also Elise the deepest darkest forces in this nation and that's what I believe Donald Trump has chosen to do when he said after Charlottesville there were and I quote very fine people on both sides I said then it gave license and safe harbor to white supremacist and neo-nazis and to the Ku Klux Klan these words not only stunned America but they stunned the world and in doing so he assigned a moral equivalence a moral equivalence between those spewing hate and those of the courage to stand against it I said at the time we're in a battle for the soul of this nation I said it again when I announced my candidacy and I say it here today we are in the battle for the soul of this nation that's why primarily I'm running for president [Applause] Charlottesville Charlottesville was no isolated incident when Trump announced he was running for president he called Mexicans rapists days before the midterm he fulminant fears of a caravan heading to the United States craziness Terry ass Terry when he said look look what's marching up this is an invasion an invasion the asserted that immigrants would quote carve you up with a knife more recently he called American a major American Center City a disgusting rat infected rodent mess no human being he said would choose to live as though the vibrant diverse community around Baltimore somehow was less than human at a rally in Florida when asked the crowd how do we stop these people meaning immigrants someone yelled back shoot them and he smiled in North Carolina he basked and the chance of send her back that going across the stadium how far is it from Trump saying this is an invasion to the shooter in El Paso declaring quote this attack is a response to Hispanic invasion of Texas how far apart are those comments how far is it from white supremacist and neo-nazis in charlottesville trump's very fine people chanting you will replace us to the shooter at the Tree of Life synagogue and Pittsburgh saying we're committing genocide Jews are committing genocide on his people I don't think it's that far at all he's both clear language and encode this president has fanned the flames of white supremacy in this nation his low-energy vacant ID mouthing of the words written for him condemning white supremacist this week I don't believe fooled anyone at home or abroad his energetic embrace the unknown Jacob Riis of this president by the darkest hearts and most hate filled minds in this country say it all when the white nationalist Richard Spencer celebrated Trump's election by declaring Heil Trump at an all-right conference where the Nazi salute was being used in Charlottesville David Duke the former leader of the crate the KKK said this is why we voted for Donald Trump because he said he's going to take back the country after Trump tweeted his go back a screed a leading Nazi website neo-nazi website said this is the kind of nationalism we elected him for he knows that he saw and on H an even for radicalism on the Internet where a declaration of hate linked to El Paso shooter was posted one commentator wrote that Trump is helping normalize the most extreme radical sentiments because his perceived Authority carries so much weight we have a problem with this rising tide of Supremacy white supremacy in America and we have a president who encourages and embolden sit the statistics are clear extremism is on the rise in America the Southern Poverty Center finds that of the 1020 hate groups operate in the United States in 2018 that's how many there are they pointed out that white nationalist groups have surged by over 50% in 2017 an active shooter with ties the white extremism claimed 135 victims and 70 kill according to the anti-defamation league all but one of the 50 extremists linked murders counted in 2018 had direct links to white supremacists his own FBI director recently testified to Congress that extreme white right-wing groups white nationalists posed the greatest threat to racially motivated domestic terrorism and what has Trump done he's poured fuel on the fire he's retweeted postings from extremists and white nationalists he's cutting funding in some cases completely eliminated funding initiated by Barak by the President and I in our administration to counter violent extremism at home Trump readily eagerly attacks Islamic terrorism but can barely bring himself to use the words white supremacy and even when he says it he doesn't appear to believe it he seems more concerned about losing their votes than beating back this hateful ideology he says guns are not the problem in mass shootings the issue is mental health it's a dodj hatred isn't a mental health issue I can tell you as the guy who along with Senator Dianne Feinstein got the assault weapons ban in the high-capacity magazines ban in this country for ten years the elected president we will do it again do it again [Music] [Applause] a hundred rounds in Dayton 30 round clips no passive they'll be banned and when we do it will put in place a buyback program to get as many as these military-style weapons of war as possible off the street and we need we need a domestic terrorism law we can do without infringing on anyone's free speech without tampering with anybody's liberties quite simply we have to make the same commitment as a nation to root out domestic terrorism as we have and stopping international terrorism I wish I could say that this all began with Donald Trump and will end with him but it didn't and I won't American history is not a fairy tale the battle for this soul the nation has been a constant push and pull for 243 years between the American ideal that says were all created equal and the harsh reality that racism has long torn us apart the same document that promised to secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity also allowed for slavery and the so called three-fifths compromise that discounted the very humanity of black people in America at the time the honest truth is both elements are part of the American character at our best the American ideal wins out but it's never a rout it's always a fight and it's a battle that is never fully finished go back to the beginning Thomas Jefferson wrote what many believed to be the mole important document civil document in human history but he was a slaveholder we've never lived up to our American ideals Jefferson himself didn't but what he wrote has pulled us towards justice for more than two centuries and it still does it remains this nation's North Star take a look at the Klan Ku Klux Klan after the Civil War we saw a rise in the Klan it was beaten down only to rise up again in the 20s in fact in august of nineteen twenty five thirty thousand fully clad Klansmen and their robes and pointed hats marched down Pennsylvania avenues the streets of Washington imagine imagine that today and then the Klan was once again beaten back as it was after the Civil War how the courts the press and yes presidents stood against them and that is the point our institutions often imperfectly stood against hate at moments when we were most tested American presidents have stepped up in the past George HW Bush renouncing his membership in the NRA President Clinton after oklahoma city george w bush going to a mosque after 9/11 President Obama after Charleston presidents who led who opposed chose to fight for what the best of American character is about there's deafening silence now sadly we don't have that today our president has aligned himself with the darkest forces in this nation and it makes winning this battle for the soul of our nation that much tougher harder Trump doesn't understand what Franklin D Roosevelt did Roosevelt said the president's his quote pre-eminently a place of moral leadership he doesn't see what JFK did when he said only the president represents the national interest he's blind to what Lyndon Baines Johnson said of the office when he said quote nothing makes a man come to grips more directly with his conscience than the presidency Trump offers no moral leadership seems to have no interest in unifying this nation no evidence that the presidency has awakened his conscience in the least indeed we have a president with a toxic tongue who was publicly and unapologetically embraced a political strategy of hate racism and division so it's up to us as it was in the 20s it's up to us we're living through a rare moment in this nation in history where our president isn't up to the moment where our president lacks the moral authority to lead where our president has more in common with George Wallace than he does with George Washington you know [Music] we are almost 330 million Americans will have to do what our president can't stand together stand against hate stand up for what is the best our nation's best when were the best and this nation we believe when we're at our best we believe in honesty decency treating everyone with respect giving everyone a fair shot leaving nobody behind giving hate no safe harbor demonizing no one not the poor the powerless the immigrant or the other leading by the power of our example not by the example of our power that's allowed to sustain as a beacon to the world being part of something bigger than ourselves it's a code it's a uniquely American code that's who we are but Donald Trump doesn't get it what this president doesn't understand is that like every other nation on earth were unable to define what constitutes American by religion by ethnicity or by tribe you can't do it America is an idea an idea stronger than any army bigger than any ocean more powerful than any dictator or tyrant it gives hope to the most desperate people on earth and it's not only our values that are under assault our democracies as well a free press an independent judiciary a legislature there's a co-equal branch of government these are the guardrail [Music] these are the guardrails of our democracy they're written into our Constitution and if you've noticed for the last two plus years they've been under attack phrases like fake news enemy of the people they're no joke they're insidious they're corrosive just look around the world the worst despot Tsar now using chumps language to justify their own abuses of power Trump is trying to weaken our institutions the press the courts the Congress precisely because they are the only checks on his power that's what this is all about the abuse of power if there's one thing I can't stand and I know you can't is the abuse of power whether it's a boss taking advantage of his or her workers or a man who raised his hand to a woman or a child or a president who's running roughshod over everything this country believes in stands [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] not how old are young you are you've never seen anything like this in your lifetime we're being reminded every day that there's nothing guaranteed about democracy not even here in America we have to constantly earn it we have to protect it we have to fight for it I believe America's and as Lincoln named us the last best hope on earth we have to remember why it's not because you're the biggest economy the strongest military in the history of the world it's not because we have the most innovative entrepreneurs and the greatest research universities that's all true but it's not why we're America the reason is what we believe the most powerful idea in the history of the world I think beats in the heart of the people of this country it beats in all of us no matter your race your ethnicity no matter your gender identity your sexual orientation no matter your faith it beats in the hearts of the rich and poor alike the unites America where their ancestors were native to these shores but there are brought here forcibly and enslaved where there are immigrants and generations back like my family from Ireland or those coming today looking to build a better life for their families the American creed that we're all created equal was written long ago but the genius of every generation Americans has opened it wider and wider and wider to include those who have been excluded in the previous generation that's why it's never gathered any dust in our history books it's still alive today more than 200 years after its inception but i honest to god don't believe donald trump sees it that way On January 20th 2017 in his inaugural address Donald Trump painted a dark bleak picture of our country in crisis when he declared an I quote this American carnage stops right here it stops right now but as a sitting president Trump's anger hate and divisiveness pitting Americans against one another preying on our divisions and doing nothing nothing about the endemic and the epidemic of guns is fueling a literal carnage in America we now have more mass shootings in the year 2019 since January then we have days that pass since January 1 2019 as of Monday according to the data from the gun violence archives there have been 255 mass shootings in the first 217 days of this year you can't listen to us go on we can't and I will not let this man be reelected president of the United States of America [Applause] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] Thanks [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] what his incompetence his immorality his carnage stops with us right here right now starting in the Midwest limited to four years I believe and I really do believe this that history will look back on this president as an aberrant moment in American history but if Donald Trump is reelected I believe he will forever and fundamentally alter the character of this nation if we give Donald Trump four more years this will not be the country envisioned by Washington and Adams and Jefferson we give Donald Trump four more years this will not be the nation bound together by Lincoln if we give Donald Trump four more years this will not be the nation lifted up by Roosevelt or inspired by Kennedy will not be the nation that Barack Obama proved tour bends toward justice the danger [Applause] [Music] danger Donald Trump and they all right posed to this nation isn't hypothetical or exaggerated it's real the core values is this nation our standing in the world our very democracy everything that makes America America is at stake folks everyone knows who Donald Trump is even the people who support him we have to show who we are we choose hope over fear we choose science over fiction we choose unity over division and yes we choose truth over lies [Applause] [Music] we stand together if we stand together we will win the battle for the soul of this nation where the United States America there's not a single thing beyond our capacity if we stand together and get up and remember who we are this is the United States of America period thank you and may God protect our troops [Applause] hey NBC News viewers thanks for checking out our YouTube channel subscribe by clicking on that button down here and

folks your patience exceeds your good judgment the good news is I'm last folks it's great to be with you all tonight you heard some some great people tonight people who all across the board and folks you heard from people who who share one fundamental belief that there is an existential threat if we in fact keep Donald Trump for president for four more years now I'm not saying it for applause because you know ladies and gentlemen presidents the words they say matter they can move markets they can send women and men to war they can make peace they can inspire us to reach the moon they can appeal to our better angels but they can also unleash the ugliest most venal side of society and ladies and gentlemen when Donald Trump has since he's become president that's exactly what he's done he's unleashed a constant battle has taken place in America from the beginning we had been here before we've been here four before with the Ku Klux Klan after after the Civil War we've been here when 3,000 Klansmen in 1925 walked down the streets of Pennsylvania Avenue in Washington DC wearing full garb and when in fact their pointed hats and the like when there were over 30 members of the House who were declared Klan members when in fact there were I think six or seven senators from Oakland Klan members but ladies and gentlemen you know we we fought back we fought back because we had people that in fact decided that that's not who we are that's been a constant battle with us reason I'm telling you this is it's not that we can't overcome it I want to make it clear we can overcome this but we must you know when you saw those people walking out in the fields in Charlotte's Ville they're contorted faces with anger chanting the anti-semitic vile that you that they did carrying Nazi flags accompanied by white supremacists as well as as well as Ku Klux Klan the fact was that what happened then was David Duke talked about the President on States in terms of this is what we wanted him to do he said he'd return us to what we should be we found a president who said at the time when asked when that young woman was killed what about the two groups had clashed and he said what no other president has ever said he said there are some very fine people on both sides no he did this is this is a reality and ladies and gentlemen you know Donald Trump offers no moral leadership he has no interest in unifying the country there's no evidence that the presidency has awakened his conscience in any conscious way instead he's publicly and unapologetically embraced the political strategy hate racism and division this is about more than any issue we can discuss today you're gonna get a chance to each one of us discuss in detail where we stand and many of all already heard us do that but ladies and gentlemen sup to all of us 330 million Americans who have to do what our president can't stand together stand against hate stand up to let's call this what it is this is white

judiciary a legislature is supposedly a co-equal branch of the government these these are the guardrails that sited that we set up long ago to contain the abuse of power and ladies and gentlemen an American Creed the American creed has always been that we are all created equal that that that we hold these truths of evident that we the people in order to form a more perfect we've never lived up to it we've never fully dug but every single generation has moved that curve as Barack says closer to justice but here's the deal every generation has done it but ladies and gentlemen the fact we never lived up to it isn't because we can't do it every single generation has done it and every that's why it's never gotten gathered dust in the history books all that we stand for folks look the fact of the matter is that Donald Trump doesn't get it he truly doesn't understand that we're all about four years of Donald Trump is going to go down in history as an aberration in America but eight years of Donald Trump will fundamentally change who we are as a nation ladies and gentlemen the core values of this nation our standing in the world our very own sense of who we are is at stake so

18,sL1UF0KDwsE,biden,2019-10-03T20:05:37Z,"Joe Biden's Full Remarks in Reno, Nevada | Joe Biden for President",speech,last week the House of Representatives open an inquiry into whether or not the President of the United States has committed any impeachable offense well I want to be very serious for a moment here it's investigation is going to focus on Donald Trump's attempt to alleged attempt at least he basically acknowledged it but attempt to extort a foreign government the government of Ukraine to manufacture charges against me and to go after my family and undermine my candidacy for president nine states America that he that he corrupted and weaponized this is further goes on corrupted and weaponized the very agencies of government to include the National Security Council the Justice Department the State Department the office of vice-president to do his his personal bidding they betrayed the foreign policy and the national security interest of the government is what they have asserted in the service of his reelection for years Trump has dismissed and excused Russian aggression in Ukraine including the illegal annexation of Crimea and four years Trump has made no secret about his desire to welcome Vladimir Putin back into the fold at Ukraine's expense Trump has emissaries and his emissaries have sought regrettably to extort extort the existential extort the existential fears of the Ukrainian leaders for political examine for political advantage now we know that he may have held up political support and vital support needed an aid appropriated by the Congress to pursue you to pressure Ukraine to give in to his political demands and he personally told the leader of Ukraine the American for that American foreign policy was not any longer going to be run through the State Department it was a GUI run through his personal private lawyer who is was demanding non-existent dirt to be dug up on me and the State Department instead of carrying out our nation's foreign policy was enlisted to do his bidding it appears people around the president knew what he was doing and knew it was wrong profoundly wrong and they tried to cover it up by hiding the evidence the accusation further goes now because of the courageous actions of a whistleblower the Trump scheme has been exposed and in many cases already acknowledged by him he did it because like every bully in history he's afraid he's afraid of just how badly he may be beaten in November of 2020 now now that all this has come out Trump's predictable response has been to attack me and my family desperate and defensive trump sends out crazed tweets one after another insinuating that the whistleblower should be dealt with extensively these words executed threatening to prosecute the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee warning die early of a civil war if something if he is impeached he repeatedly it's a spearing me and my families his party fans out to carry out the smear and millions millions of dollars in dishonest attack ads are blanketing the airwaves paid for by the special interest as well as served by his presidency now let me make something clear to mr. Trump and his hatchet man and the special interest funding his attacks against me I'm not going anywhere you're not going to destroy me you're not going to destroy my family I don't care how much money you spend mr. president or how dirty the attacks get Trump knows there are no truth in the charges against me none zero every independent news organization that has reviewed the charges at length has found it to be a flat-out lie his assertions every single one what I did in Ukraine was carried out the official policy of the United States government to root out corruption in Ukraine in conjunction with our European allies the International Monetary Fund and its leader our closest Democratic allies and the courageous reformers in Ukraine who I met on the ground when I was there multiple times it was a fully transparent policy carried out in front of the whole world and fully fully embraced by the international community of democracies we weren't pressing Ukraine to get rid of a tough prosecutor we're pursuing Ukraine to replace a weak prosecutor who wouldn't do his job with someone at the time we hope would finally crack down on corruption in Ukraine that's what it was about Trump on the other hand was secretly putting at risk our national security by pursuing a personal political vendetta against me because I don't think he wants to run against me and what is and what is truly stunning about this is the exhortation involved holding back desperately desperately needed military assistance and political support for our Ukrainian friends while they're engaged and I'll get I want to make this clear there's a live war going on now now a live war with Russians now in the east a war that has cost thousands thousands of Ukrainian lives thus far and it continues this isn't a game it's deadly serious but as you know all too well the truth doesn't matter to Donald Trump it never has and it never will which is why I don't think the American people are going to believe in the American people know me and they know him and I'll put my integrity of my whole career public service of this nation up against his long record of lying cheating and stealing any day of the week yeah the idea the idea of Donald Trump attacking anyone's integrity is a joke no everybody knows who Donald Trump is even the people who first support him they know who he is but it's important to step back from the heat of 24-hour news cycle and focus carefully on the larger story it's not about Donald Trump's annex it's about what he has brought Donald Trump and the nation to this sobering moment in American history it's about the choice we're facing in 2020 what has brought us here is simply this the abuse of power the abuse of power is the defining characteristic of the Trump presidency the American presidency is an office of immense power that's why character matters more the President of the United States than any other office in our government that's why one of the greatest threats to our democracy is a president who puts his personal personal interest his own personal gain ahead of the public good and that's why Trump will do anything it takes to hold on to that job we need to be clear about something the threat posed by this president isn't just to our Constitution it isn't just an academic exercise in political theory a president who puts his own interest ahead of the public good and national security also poses a threat to each and every American's daily lives factual this is on full display just a few days after the house opened an impeachment inquiry when we saw a wounded president meeting with the president of the NRA in his office now as they say in my state do y'all think they were talking about the safety of the American people or do you think maybe they were talking about how much money the NRA was going to spend to keep Trump in office or do you think they think it mattered more to Trump his reelection for the safety of our children but do you think they talked about Trump protecting the NRA the NRA protecting Donald Trump you want an example of what happens when a president puts his own selfish interests ahead of national interest when a president abuses power well I'd say this is Exhibit A you want another example climate change folks it's not possible for Trump to do anymore for the fossil fuel industry he's turned his back on science he's pulled America out of the Paris agreement which we negotiated he repealed the new fuel economy standards we put in place by this administration supported by the automakers and return the money is pouring in we're facing an existential crisis the UN tells us we have roughly 10 years to deal with this problem and he's single-handedly standing in the way what about health care Trump has relentlessly and cynically attacked Obamacare he has no replacement for it he just wants it gone it doesn't matter how many people are hurt it doesn't matter that will put at risk pre-existing condition protections for over a hundred million Americans it doesn't matter the women once again be able to be charged more just because of their gender it's an Obama achievement so it has to go and if in the process you can pocket big money for your campaign from insurance companies all the better or how about his wall [Laughter] you know you know the one Mexico was the Mexico was gonna pay for his you got it by the way his big promise of 2016 is going nowhere instead of comprehensive immigration reform we now have political grandstanding about the wall that no Mexico will not pay for and yes cruel and unusual policies that separate families seek to keep our kids their kids in cages indefinitely without the basic necessities is soap and toothbrushes it continues folks this is not who we are this is not America that we know Donald Trump acts reacts twists and turns to what he thinks is good for him for his ego his personal politics his campaign money and virtually every day he launches a barrage of tweets attacking disparaging insulting threatening anyone who doesn't bathe him in praise there's no hyperbole in that statement that's a fact he's even gone so far as the threat in the whistleblower now fearful about his reelection he's becoming more unhinged he wants a campaign on his terms he imagines that this tactic will allow him to pick his opponent and face only the candidates he thinks he can beat we're not glad Donald Trump choose the Democratic candidate but that's why I picked up the phone and call the leader of Ukraine and pressured him to manufacture a case to smear the opponent he seems not to want to face here's what rump and a special interest paying for his campaign know they know I've taken them on in the past and I beaten them and I know I'll do it again they know I'm not just promising change they know I will deliver it I've taken on the NRA twice and beat them both times we made and by the way the majority of the members didn't ira agree with us now on the things we're pulling for we made the brady building law we baited assault weapons we limited magazine clips we can do it all over again we took on the health insurance industry we passed Obamacare we'll take them on again my plan is to build on Obamacare with a public option health insurance companies hate it that's why they're already attacking my plan and they don't want the competition will come from a public option and they don't like the fact that I'm gonna limit drug prices and take them to court to do it here's what those special interests fear they know I can get it done not in five years not in ten years but now our administration Barack and I made the largest ever investment in clean energy in the Recovery Act what's the hundred billion dollars almost we reassemble the international coalition to combat climate change over 190 nations Trump Trump has abdicated America's leadership on climate I will reassert it so I'm not surprised Donald Trump asked a foreign government for help to beat me I'm not surprised that the head of the NRA met with Trump to prop him up I'm not surprised special interest friends are spending millions of dollars on attack ads I'm not surprised this president's allegations of wrongdoing against me have been debunked across the board by every major publication in the country I'm not going to get but I'm not gonna I'm not gonna let him have it as his way I'm not backing down I'm not going to be distracted by his lies and Spears and stores in his name calling I'm gonna Congress do its job and deal with impeachment I'm gonna stay focused on your lives and I mean this to the bottom my heart from your lives both well we can't lose sight of that I mean this think about it we can't lose sight of this election is about you your families your kids your children it's about you and you can't wait when it comes to health care or jobs or education gun rationale gun policy climate you know the world can't wait for America to once again lead a stable peaceful international order again I've said it before and I will say it again like JFK when he spoke about taking America to the moon he said I refused to postpone the work that has to get done I refused to postpone well I refuse to postpone any longer what has to be done for the American people for you folks I know these things take vision they take plans and a lot of people have vision and plans but it's not enough it takes proven ability to get things done there's really good people in this race for the nomination but no one in this race was a stronger record I'm passing a big consequential legislation in Maine that sounds so self-serving but from the ban on assault weapons to the Violence Against Women Act to Obamacare I could go on I've been there and I know what it takes to get it done thank let me let me finish with this you've been very patient a lot of my opponents say we have to do more than just beat Donald Trump I agree we have to do more than beat Donald Trump we have to beat him like a drum god bless you all may God bless our troops thank you thank you thank you [Applause],b last week the house of representatives open an inquiry into whether or not the president of the united states have commit any impeachable offense well i want to be very serious for a moment here PRON be

22,WP0QAeuSFsI,biden,2019-10-23T16:04:10Z,"Joe Biden Speaks in Scranton, Pennsylvania",speech,"thank you thank you please please have a seat rosemary thank you very very much for that very generous introduction my name is Joe white and I am Jill Biden's husband and Jean Finnegan son I'm from 24:46 North Washington Avenue and I'm happy to be home happy to be home no it really is it really is good to be home you know it's presumptions for me to say home I know but you know Scranton when your kid no matter how long you live here climbs into your heart and an occupied you so many people you know are from Scranton so many people from Scranton and so many people great people here my mother Catherine Eugenia Finnegan Biden on North Washington Avenue st. Paul's Mary wood raised his grand first 35 years of the life before we moved to Delaware she lived to age 92 thank God and the last 10 years of life she's lived with me and you know after my dad passed she moved in but it was a struggle to get her to move in with us because when I was growing up in Delaware in our 3-bedroom split-level home as for most of my career my life we always had a relative living with us either my grandpa or my great aunt or an uncle there's always someone in our three bedrooms two level home with four kids and mom and dad it was great for the kids it really was very heaven poppin with us my grandpa and so on but the fact of the matter was that my mother looking back on it those walls were pretty thin and so after my dad passed away my I tried to get mom to move in with me in a home that we had just built I built a suite for my mom and dad but my dad was in Hospice the last five months of his life at our home and and but my mom wouldn't move in because she said she wasn't gonna do that to me and but I said mom not doing that to me you're doing it for us she didn't want to be burdened she but that's how my sister and brothers were raised were raised taught that it's all about family family and family is no burden even even then she wouldn't actually move into our house she sold her house and asked me to build there was a little barn on the property that bought five acres I'd purchased he wanted me to build her a house there at least I got every night I'd come home get to kiss her goodnight my wife Jill is it was a crazy thing for her so she'd say even with your mother I could smell ice cream and I got to kiss her good morning as I headed to the train but that satisfied her pride and gave the whole family solace everything my sister Valerie and I learned came from Scranton Scranton sort of as I said creeps into your heart never leaves you when people would ask my mom after she had been in Delaware that's not an exaggeration over fifty years where she lives where she's from when she was out of Wilmington she said I'm from Scranton I'm from Scranton not a joke she and my dad passed along those values that the Scranton families are all about she used to say Joey remember this is God's truth remember we were defined by your courage and you're redeemed by their loyalty that was my grandfather Ambrose Finnegan was all about courage she said Joey courage is the greatest virtue of all because out courage you can't love with abandon that's what I learned I learned it here and I suspect most of you learn the same things here in Scranton my dad moved here with his father and mother moved to done or when he was a senior in high school went to st. Thomas's now prep and and we're all my extended family was here as well including some of my relatives that are here today and the fitting is the Gaffney's many maybe the most important thing my father taught me was that raised in the same tradition that I found everybody that I grew up with here and stayed in contact with here over my career everybody has the same notion every single person my dad you said no matter who they are Joey is entitled to be treated with dignity dignity a word I think that is probably used more here in Scranton at least in my experience than anywhere else it's all about dignity no matter what your station of life is no matter what your background is everybody everybody's entitled to treat you with dignity my dad my dad was a real gentleman and he would tell you Joe and remember you have to be and you say the same to my sister only he'd say a woman he'd say Joey you have to be a man of your word without your word you're not a man it's about honor no it's about honor it's about family I learned that at my grandpa's kitchen table here in Green Ridge not a joke you know you say Joey family's the beginning of the middle and the end the older I got the more I learned to admire my dad's courage and resilience when Scranton fell on hard times in the late 40s and early 50s my dad who if you listened to Barack he always talks about scrappy Joe Biden from Scranton well you know people who double resent the hell out of that I represented him for over 40 years but uh matter of fact I was in a parade I read in a little town called whole cast in one of my son passed away one of the one of the favorite parades the kids would go to with me and I'm walking down the parade route and thanking them for being good to my boy and three guys looking like you that I played ball with in school came running up behind me said Joe what tells all of us about Scranton got them here from Delaware but my dad like I said if you listen to Barack you think I climbed out of a coal mine on the lunch bucket head now well my dad was the white-collar salesperson but there was not a lot of work up here today in the early fifties and I remember him making what I call the longest walk and some of you had to make and some of your family members had made the longest walk up a short flight of stairs to a child's bedroom and tell them honey you can't play in the green building anymore you can't go back to the school because Dad don't have a job dad's got to move we can't everything's gonna change and I remember dad doing that matter of fact Herman literally back to my my ancestral home up there the woman who always just been a lovely lovely person and become a friend she stills a person who bought it from my grandpa died and and it just brings back memories he came up and he said we've got to move honey but I'm gonna comb it's only 157 miles away I guess he had been gone grazed in Wilmington up until he was a junior in high school it's only a hundred fifty seven miles away and I'm at home every weekend I remember thinking that was like going to the moon 157 miles you know and and he did but it was until I got a lot older I realized how much must have affected his pride having to walk into the kitchen and my grandpa Finnegan who had four sons and and say you know can I can I leave gene in the kids here with you I promise I'll pay you back I'll be back I promise can you do it wasn't a second thought for my grandpa but it takes a lot of pride for a man or a woman to do that and say can you take care of things can you do something and you know although was hard for him I didn't think was hard for my grandpa because again his family and you know I've had nothing but great memories about scram climbing we used to be that 10 foot Stonewall Marie would have an apple flight son behind the wall climbing the flagpole Maloney feel I might say the only kid who went to the top my generation being you know that penny candy the place called Sammy's is no longer cities and Pepsi's and going down to the Rudy the ruins of building Grier each corner so matinees and then playing out the matinee and the way home trying to walk across that pipe across the laki you know that you know because that's what the heroes did you know sometimes fallen in but you know there's nothing like good memories but more than the memories what I remember most is I think about as I get older as the values that were instilled in me up here the point of all this is I look back on it is that this is what I learned about loyalty that's what I learned about patriotism that's what I learned about what friendship means yes I learned about family and faith faith that helped me get through a lot of tough times of my life and a lot of you and through tougher times and I have known as the philosopher Kierkegaard said faith sees best in the dark faith sees best in the dark well we all go through dark times because of the faith was instilled in me here we've been able to traverse it well my dad made that walk up the stairs he told me honey everything's gonna be okay once we get settled in Delaware we're all gonna all gonna come down and be together and it was my dad then in the mid 50s believed everything's gonna be okay because the middle class still had a fighting chance then and it became okay we moved a little steel town called Claymont Delaware that is no longer steel town we rented apartments for several years we finally got to move into a you know suburban neighborhood not far from there in suburban Wilmington when the developments were like the Levittown kind of developments were being developed a 3-bedroom split-level house that was in a safe neighborhood with four kids and as I said a relative but you know from that time from the time we were old enough to listen every time someone a relative in Delaware or a friend lost a job or a neighbor lost a job because of a recession or because of a company one under my dad used to say and I'll give you my word to this you'd say Joey remembering jobs about a lot more than a paycheck it's about your dignity it's about your place in the community it's about who you are it's about being able to look your child in the eye and say honey it's going to be okay and mean it well that's how we were raised my guess is that's how the bulk of you were raised here in Scranton wilkes-barre area we were raised to believe family loyalty treating everyone dignity is what we should do because a lot of us knew it was not was like not to be treated with dignity by people with wealth and people who somehow thought that we weren't quite quite their equals I can hear her now my mom I used to stutter badly when I was a kid mom said remember Joey nobody's better than you but everybody's are equal my dad would say not a joke he said Joey the measure of success is not whether or not you get knocked down it's how quickly you get up so get the hell up man my dad as he got older if I wanted to take you over to meet my daddy be angry if I didn't call him as he make sure he had to have a sport coat on to meet you not a being the sweats he wanted to greet you at his home my dad was very manners to my dad for a big big deal one day he was over to our house in the house that I had built and I guess I was looking out over this little pond it's on at Delaware but I guess I was kind of feeling sorry for myself I was talking about my deceased wife and and he said Joey he said come on and he left and went up to the Hallmark store he came back and I have it on my desk to this day a cart you know you can go in those stores and get a little glass rectangular case with a cartoon or a saying or something on it he came back and gave me this cartoon and I have it now and it sits on my desk and it's been there for over 25 years that's not true 19 years and and it says I I'm not a big funny paper guy but my dad was a cartoon cat used to be called Hagar the horrible it was the Viking and there's two frames in this in this picture and again it reminds me of the resilience of the people of Scranton and claim home run from it's a picture of Hagar and his Viking ship has crashed onto the rocks and the the mast is down and he stands has his hand he's shaking his fist to heaven he's saying why me God and the voice from heaven the next same exact scene with his hand up and a voice from heaven says why not why not you why not you well folks a lot of people here in Scranton all across America have over the last decades and even now had to make that longest walk but today too many middle-class and working-class folks can't look their kids in the eye any longer and it's going to be okay and meaning that's why I'm running I'm running to rebuild the backbone of this country the backbone of this country is the middle class you know and this time and this time we have to bring everybody along regardless of your race your ethnicity your gender your disability everybody's got to come along because folks let's get something straight Wall Street did not build America investing bankers did not build America hardworking middle-class people build American unions built the middle class and the middle class built this country and all this talk I got act yesterday did an interview for 60 minutes that's going to be coming on 60 minutes for 90 minutes and they asked me about well in there are things well unemployment down to three and that percent I said go back to your old neighborhoods ask them how they're doing how they're feeling they're in trouble there used to be a basic bargain in America that if you contribute to the well-being of the outfit you worked with you got to share in the benefits well that bargains been broken corporate Americans were knowing incredibly well for the last 15 years their profits to come up exponentially it used to be there was a direct relationship between so-called productivity how much more got put out on a factory floor or out of a corporation and salary from the end of World War two to the end of the 70s productivity went up over 90 some percent 94 I think it was wages went up 95 percent since then productivity has gone up 68 or 69 percent wages 8% what happened what happened to that bargain it's not happening anymore studies show that middle class families have difficulty making they're losing hope half of them think their children will never be in a situation as good or better off than they were you're all raised to believe that if you worked better you worked hard you can even be better off than your parents but not today they don't believe it studies show that if you have an unexpected expense during the month of $400 or more you can't pay it you got to either borrow the money or sell something ladies and gentlemen we have to rebuild the middle class let me explain what I mean by middle-class you know I have a lot of economists work for me they'll tell you middle class is 50 1800 or 50 mm Phillips classes of value set new classes being able to send your child to a park and know they're going to clump safely being able to send them to the local public school that you know if they do well they be able to go beyond school they've been able to get a degree they're better to get oh really and knowing if they get in you can find a way to pay for it new class is being able to take your geriatric mom home when dad dies and hope your children never have to take care of you that's middle-class just a little bit of breathing room it's hard for a family today to maintain their dignity if they don't have health care I can't imagine turning to your child has a pre-existing condition and say sorry kid nothing I can do for you I can't help you look and saying insurance look I can't imagine what it'd be like for people and many of you know it and many of you been through it how many of you raise your hand if you're lost someone to cancer or cancer yourself how many of you lost a close family member a son a daughter of a husband or a wife I can't imagine what it would like when my son Beau a decorated veteran a major United States Army volunteered to go to Attorney General of the state of Delaware volunteered to go to Iraq he was there for a year Bronze Star could speak his service medal and many other honors comes home and he gets diagnosed with terminal cancer I can't imagine lying in that bed toward the end of the insurance company could have come in and said to him I'm sorry pal you've run out of your coverage suffer in peace the next three or four months as long as you live can't fathom it how can a family maintain their dignity if they don't have a child who is has some talent wants to go beyond high school and they look at them and they can't get there my dad we got to Delaware the first good job he was able to get after several years he ended up being the manners of an automobile dealership great thing about that is that you always get a new car for the prom I remember going down after a baseball game he we his the dealership he ran was down where the university is New York and we lived about 25 minutes from there and I went to a school and claimed on at the time high school I'm never going down on my baseball uniform racing down on the 51 Plymouth convertible with a rip top and and beach towels for for seat covers and I park it in one spot I ran in and asked his I ran to the NASA secretary Mary where's dad because I was going to get a car to go to the senior prom and she said he's out in the alley honey going into the shop I walked out and my dad was pacing back and forth true story he looked at me and said Joey's and Oh Joey son I'm so sorry so damn sorry this before cellphones or anything I thought maybe something happened to one of my two brothers or sister my mom so what's the matter dad said I went to the bank then financed all the car loans they had I spoke to Charlie the guy who's vice president Charlie adulterous I spoke to Charlie honey they won't lend me the money to get you to college I'm so damn ashamed I'm ashamed why else would he be ashamed how many people sat at the kitchen table today they've had the conversation saying you know if we got to drive on those four tires for another ten thousand miles I can't afford a new set of tires this month we gotta wait who's gonna tell her she can't go back we just don't have the money what are we gonna do about that insurance this administration has no idea what hard-working decent ordinary Americans are going through you know parent how many of you is there Grandpop's or grand moms and moms or dads dropped off your childhood grandchild the first day of school with their preschool or 1st 2nd 3rd 4th 5th grade no one around America they were gonna have to learn how to duck and cover building schools telling kids the way you get behind this pillar here if someone comes in you know the greatest concern I've spoke to the International Psychiatric Association and the American Psychiatric Association of London you know the generation that is most has the greatest degree of anxiety of any generation of America kids between 7 and 20 years old not their greatest fear is being shot in school no not generally being shot in school you saw all the pictures have gone back to school about kids but that new schools were building and that's all because we don't have the nerd you take on the damn NRA and the gun manufacturers there's no need oh there's no need for this you some of your hunters I've got shotguns my sons or hunters mainly geese you know if you go out and hunt for geese you're not allowed to having a shotgun more than three shells protect the geese we have federal laws that protect geese more that not think about why in god's name should anyone be able to have a clip that holds 100 rounds the administration keeps doing the bidding so they enter into gun manufacturers you know I'm not against the Second Amendment Second Amendment says it's not absolute if this is the my friends and the far-right talk about the tree of liberty is water with the blood of patriots you got to be able to fight against the government guess what you need an m1 tank man need an f15 you need some help fire missiles but you can't happen they can't have bazookas we can't have machine guns we've never argued there are certain weapons that people can't bone there's never been a time in history the Second Amendment when we've said anybody can own a weapon anybody folks how could a fair and feel good about raising a child in neighborhoods where the ground water is polluted because the oil companies polluting it or whether or not the ground water pipes are made of wood or they're put in there.put in in 1960 and no longer are safe how many schools around the country no for all I know here in Lackawanna in Luzerne counties the water in the schools is not safe look we all want the same thing a fair shot a life of dignity and the peace of mind when someone gets sick you have a little breathing room when the bill comes through a shot for a better future with all due respect and I've never talked about a president like this true I don't think Donald Trump is capable of understanding that he doesn't seem to have any sense of empathy at all for people [Applause] I've not seen it if it exists unlike any other president that I've ever worked with and folks you know I'm not sure Donald Trump has any idea what I'm talking about when I talked about the longest walk you know I think that the longest walk his father were made was to drop off four hundred million dollars in his trust account it's okay I'd like to have had that problem but look let me tell you why I'm running first I'm thinking about health care nine years ago we fought like hell to get Obamacare passed generations have tried to do that well we got it done health care is more than just the luxury reserved to those who can afford it it's a right it's a right we all deserve it's central to our dignity and who we want to be as a country one of my proudest moments in those eight years was standing long President Obama getting it done generations of Americans have fought to make that promise real it was a really big deal a really big deal I wish I hadn't whispered that in the president's ear thank God my mother wasn't around but look the law has saved lives to save lives has kept families out of bankruptcy we knew it wasn't perfect when we fought hammer and tong to get it passed we wanted to do more we got as much as we could get done and it was important we put 20 million people on the rolls 160 million people had pre-existing conditions covered you know but we didn't we have to finish the job to ensure that every single American has a choice to be covered by a public option under my plan you're free to stick with the insurance you having to negotiate it with your company and you're liking a lot of you had gone through a long negotiations giving up pay raises in order to get thorough coverage under my plan you get to keep it but if you don't like it or if you're uninsured you get to sign up to a public option a Medicare like proposal my plan reduces premiums deductibles out-of-pocket cost increasing subsidies for middle-class families to buy in and for the first time they'll force private insurances to compete with your business not just with each other but with a public competitor and it isn't it isn't it to making a profit that's what the Medicare like option provides it's going to keep premiums even lower bottom line is my health care plan is the fastest most effective way to reduce cost for Americans give everybody affordable quality health insurance not in five years not in ten years but right now and we can the second thing we have to rebuild our education system as was stated at the very beginning by rosemary you know my wife who's taught her whole life is teaching at this moment she and that's why she's not up here with me she was going to Iowa tomorrow but she can't be here Debra he's in the classroom today teaching she says it best any country that out-educates us will out-compete us it's a basic thing so in the 21st century does anybody think 12 years of education is enough to get you to in the middle class to be able to stain I did a study for the president he asked me to do a study on jobs in the future second of the last year before Route six and ten jobs this moment requires something beyond high school degree six and ten we got to make sure every child has access to a good education reasons of regardless of the zip code that's why my as rosemary mentioned my plan triples title one funding for stress less at-risk schools we can afford to do that it goes from fifteen to forty five billion dollar it means every child will have access to universal pre-k and what you will apear pre-k exponentially increases the prospect that child no matter what their background is is going to finish school and go through it without getting in trouble either with the law already else that means we're going to finally pay teachers that salaries they deserve you know teachers and Social Work was graduating from school whether said to you or wherever it is they graduate and affordable for year degree they get paid less than anybody else graduating as a starting and finishing salary look the work we do is an extreme national importance their salaries reflect that we know that the 21st century as I said 12 years is not enough under my plan everyone who qualifies to go to Community College is going to be able to go for free you say well there goes that big spendin Democrat right well guess what it costs six billion dollars a year to send every qualified person who's going from high school to Community College or having to be retrained going back to Community College because they lost a job because of digitalization and Moore's law and artificial intelligence and guess what six billion dollars a lot of money we eliminate one tax loopholes called stepped-up basis there are one point six trillion dollars of loopholes in the tax code one point six trillion not the tax code the tax code you get you get a deduction for racehorses eliminate one of them it's called stepped-up basis you're about to go and cash in a capital gain you're figuratively speaking and hit by a truck you lose your life it gets left your son or daughter they don't pay a cent it's not a heritage back to the tax owed ten seconds before you got hit well guess what that cost seventeen billion dollars a year eliminate that one loophole but every single solitary person and Community College is qualified increasing the productivity in this country young people are getting crushed by the burden of student debt many of you parents are as well if you're paying back student loans through this they call an income based repayment my plan is to cut your payment's in half the way you're doing if you get out of school and you're making less than 25 year to start with you don't pay anything back and no interest accrues you're still owe it and if you make more than that you're only gonna pay five percent of your disposable income meaning after all your bills are paid and all of your cost of living is involved and if you commit to national service your teacher or paramedic police officer counseling victims of domestic violence anything involving involving public service you get ten thousand dollars a year that you work off your debt up to fifty thousand dollars and after ten years of doing it you have no debt at all that's what we're going to do - by the way Community College you know every Community College in this state if you do well in the Community College you get to go on to a four-year college all those credits are transferable to a four-year state school you've got some great state universities in this country in this state Penn State's not doing bad are they you know if you're gonna restore the middle class we need to start to reward work again not just wealth right now and under the Republican and the Trump plan we only reward wealth you know we had Donald Trump inherited a strong economy from Barack and me things were beginning to really move and just like everything else he's inheritors he's in the midst of squandering squandered we need the global economy we need the global economy then in fact rewards work not just wealth reflects our values and that's going to start I'm going to start by reversing the Trump tax cuts for the super wealthy and corporations Wolfie didn't need them in the first place in corporations have spent them on stock buybacks to further give benefits to their their stockholders but more importantly to their CEOs you know it used to be when Reagan was president the average CEO of the fortune 500 companies made 36 or 37 times what the average employee made from vice-president all the way down no it is today over four hundred and twenty times as much what happened is my mother would say who died and left them boss when did this no I'm serious I think corporations can do a lot of good things but I tell you what they don't need the tax cut reduced to 30 percent to 20 percent it's had to I think you should go back up the 28 percent instead of 39 will raise billions of dollars to be able to put it on education climate change in the rest I'm getting rid of the super wealthy tax loopholes doubling their capital gains right now if you're a fireman and a schoolteacher or you're you you work as a the police officer nurse you paid a higher tax rate than someone making ten million dollars a year higher tax rate why is that it makes no sense why should your capital gain be at 21 percent and even then most don't pay that when you're paying in 28 30 32 for 30% so every single solitary person or capital gains you can be treated like real income they're gonna take 40 percent of their capital gains on the capital gains tax it's a basic bargain to rebuild a stronger inclusive middle class it doesn't affect any games on your home and all those things that you in fact are able to take advantage of look we got to stop this awful gun violence that's ripping us apart yes this is one of the biggest fears children are facing we can't live with ourselves we don't take it on I'm the only one in the United States America has ever taken on the NRA nationally can beaten them and beaten them twice I succeeded in banning assault weapon for ten years and limiting the size of magazines how many quarters can be in a magazine I know what it takes to get it done and I can do it again and fifthly we got to confront the existential threat of climate change it is the issue facing the world though the United States accounts for about 15% of the climate change problems we have to lead by example and I've laid out a plan where we get to med zero emissions by 2050 and between now and 2030 we make such a dramatic change that we can't it can't be turned around but eighty-five percent of the problem comes from beyond our borders we needed a president can marshal those other nations to confront the greatest threat that we've ever seen to humanity that's not hyperbole it's real the first thing the first thing I'll do is present is rejoining the Paris climate Accord which I helped put together and the first hundred days of my presidency I will invite 273 other nations that are part of this to Washington DC so they upped the ante what they promise they're going to do and hold them accountable we have lost the respect of nations around the world by the way this president has acted climate isn't just an existential threat threat handled right is an extraordinary opportunity you know the uniqueness of America's better that we're the only nation in the world confront with a real serious problem we've always been able to take it and turn it into an opportunity that's who we are in the United States we can build a network of charging stations across America so by adding five hundred thousand of a move to all electric vehicles by 2020 and reducing carbon by an enormous amount we can we have ambitious plans for standards for buildings cars power grids we're gonna save you money save you opportunity and allow you to breathe cleaner we're gonna make an historic investment in clean energy research in technology investing four hundred billion dollars in the industries of the future so we've become a net exporter of all this technology creating literally millions of jobs they'll create more than 10 million good-paying jobs Union jobs making 40 bucks an hour not 15 bucks an hour for real this is what this is the projection the things I'm talking about these are really big challenges but they're no bigger than our capacities Americans so we have to get started thinking big again thinking about the future we can build Americans are doing their part they're out there working hard every day they deserve their leaders to work as hard for them we don't deserve an apartment of Education that Crusades against public schools we don't deserve a Department of Labor that puts corporate profits ahead of working class people and corporations on the board we don't deserve a foreign policy based on lies conspiracies in theory and abandon our planet most of all we don't deserve a president who both out of his way to make life in America harder crueler pettier he said he's working for the got the Forgotten American when we forgot about the Forgotten American the American middle class brings dignity integrity every day to work they deserve the dignity integrity reflected in their leaders the challenges we face are really serious but I stand here more optimistic and there was when I got elected as a 29 year old kid to the United States Senate I wasn't old enough to be sworn in when I got elected I had to wait 17 days to be eligible no really and I was characterized as the young idealistic guy who was optimistic well folks we have to restore a backbone of this nation we have to remember who the hell we are this is the United States of America there's never think about that I'm more optimistic than I've ever been in my career if we move this administration out of the way we have the most productive workers in the world our workers are three times the productive as a matter of fact than they are in Asia we have more great research universities in Pennsylvania in the United States America and all the rest of the world combined the rest of the world combined every major life-changing thing has come out of a research university monetized by corporate America but has come out of the research at the universities you own whether it's Los Alamos or whether it's any other place in the country we're in a position where the wealthiest country in the world the world why in god's name when we walk around their heads down we're the most powerful military in the history of the world no hyperbole and we've led the world not just by the example of our power or the power of our example and it's being eroded the embrace of dictators and thugs Kim Jong London love letters a guy has a guy who had his uncle's brain no literally had his uncles brains blown out sitting across the table his brother assassinated poison in an airport Putin who I know relatively well I've spent a lot of time with him Putin who has nothing in mind other than the breakup NATO reduce our influence around the world break down to my belly one thing he fears is them as democracy the embrace of the people that he has encouraged and poking their fingers in the eye of our allies treating NATO like it's a protection racket unless you unless you pay more money we're not going to keep our sacred commitment an attack of one is an attack on all I could go on you saw what just happened I've been all through that part of the world where the Kurds are I spent a lot of time in Turkey significant amount of time in Iraq in that whole area in Syria what have we just done if you found a single military person who doesn't feel like we have just be smart America's reputation around the world of being reliable 10,000 curves died died defeating Isis capturing 10,000 Isis terrorists in prison the President on a whim without the support of any of his military commanders decides he's going to make a deal with Iran who I know well to move hundreds of American troops who are trainers for the Kurds standing between the Kurds and the Turkish forces and want to wipe them out and he pulls them out you see on television women standing there holding their children under bombardment when our tanks are moving out and our military is so ashamed they're leaving throwing fruit at them saying you've abandoned us we're gonna die what the hell's going on what's going on who's gonna believe America's Word as we give it that's what the President does he speaks for America keeps commitments and then when they said all those prisons are going to escape he said well they're only gonna go to you they're not gonna come to the United States that's great isn't it that's great what our allies sitting there thinking folks look there's not a thing we can't do we're better positioned any nation in the world on 21st century we can do it in a reasonable and quick way we can unite this country because folks I'm tired of people Democrats Republicans independents walk around their heads down like woe is me folks this is the United States of America stand up take it back we can it back to anything we set our mind to this is the United States of America god bless you all may God protect our troops thank you thank you thank you [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause]",b thank PRON thank PRON please please have a seat rosemary thank PRON very very much for that very generous introduction PRON name be joe white and i be jill biden husband and jean finnegan son PRON be from north washington avenue and PRON be happy to be home happy to be home no PRON really be PRON really be good to be home PRON know PRON be presumption for PRON to say home i know but PRON know scranton when PRON kid no matter how long PRON live here climb into PRON heart and an occupied PRON so many people PRON know be from scranton so many people from scranton and so many people great people here PRON mother catherine eugenia finnegan biden on north washington avenue st paul mary wood raise PRON grand first year of the life before PRON move to delaware PRON live to age thank god and the last year of life PRON be live with PRON and PRON know after PRON dad pass PRON move in but PRON be a struggle to get PRON to move in with PRON because when i be grow up in delaware in PRON bedroom split level home as for most of PRON career PRON life PRON always have a relative living with PRON either PRON grandpa or PRON great aunt or an uncle there be always someone in PRON three bedroom two level home with four kid and mom and dad PRON be great for the kid PRON really be very heaven poppin with PRON PRON grandpa and so on but the fact of the matter be that PRON mother look back on PRON those wall be pretty thin and so after PRON dad pass away PRON i try to get mom to move in with PRON in a home that PRON have just build i build a suite for PRON mom and dad but PRON dad be in hospice the last five month of PRON life at PRON home and and but PRON mom would not move in because PRON say PRON be not go to do that to PRON and but i say mom not do that to PRON PRON be do PRON for PRON PRON do not want to be burden PRON but that be how PRON sister and brother be raise be raise teach that PRON be all about family family and family be no burden even even then PRON would not actually move into PRON house PRON sell PRON house and ask PRON to build there be a little barn on the property that buy five acre PRON would purchase PRON want PRON to build PRON a house there at least i get every night PRON would come home get to kiss PRON goodnight PRON wife jill be PRON be a crazy thing for PRON so PRON would say even with PRON mother i could smell ice cream and i get to kiss PRON good morning as i head to the train but that satisfy PRON pride and give the whole family solace everything PRON sister valerie and i learn come from scranton scranton sort of as i say creep into PRON heart never leave PRON when people would ask PRON mom after PRON have be in delaware that be not an exaggeration over fifty year where PRON live where PRON be from when PRON be out of wilmington PRON say PRON be from scranton PRON be from scranton not a joke PRON and PRON dad pass along those value that the scranton family be all about PRON use to say joey remember this be god truth remember PRON be define by PRON courage and PRON be redeem by PRON loyalty that be PRON grandfather ambrose finnegan be all about courage PRON say joey courage be the great virtue of all because out courage PRON can not love with abandon that be what i learn i learn PRON here and i suspect most of PRON learn the same thing here in scranton PRON dad move here with PRON father and mother move to do or when PRON be a senior in high school go to st thomas now prep and and PRON be all PRON extended family be here as well include some of PRON relative that be here today and the fitting be the gaffney many maybe the most important thing PRON father teach PRON be that raise in the same tradition that i find everybody that i grow up with here and stay in contact with here over PRON career everybody have the same notion every single person PRON dad PRON say no matter who PRON be joey be entitle to be treat with dignity dignity a word i think that be probably use more here in scranton at least in PRON experience than anywhere else PRON be all about dignity no matter what PRON station of life be no matter what PRON background be everybody everybody be entitle to treat PRON with dignity PRON dad PRON dad be a real gentleman and PRON would tell PRON joe and remember PRON have to be and PRON say the same to PRON sister only PRON would say a woman PRON would say joey PRON have to be a man of PRON word without PRON word PRON be not a man PRON be about honor no PRON be about honor PRON be about family i learn that at PRON grandpa kitchen table here in green ridge not a joke PRON know PRON say joey family the beginning of the middle and the end the old i get the more i learn to admire PRON dad courage and resilience when scranton fall on hard time in the late and early PRON dad who if PRON listen to barack PRON always talk about scrappy joe biden from scranton well PRON know people who double resent the hell out of that i represent PRON for over year but uh matter of fact i be in a parade i read in a little town call whole cast in one of PRON son pass away one of the one of the favorite parade the kid would go to with PRON and PRON be walk down the parade route and thank PRON for be good to PRON boy and three guy look like PRON that i play ball with in school come run up behind PRON say joe what tell all of PRON about scranton get PRON here from delaware but PRON dad like i say if PRON listen to barack PRON think i climb out of a coal mine on the lunch bucket head now well PRON dad be the white collar salesperson but there be not a lot of work up here today in the early fifty and i remember PRON make what i call the long walk and some of PRON have to make and some of PRON family member have make the long walk up a short flight of stair to a child bedroom and tell PRON honey PRON can not play in the green building anymore PRON can not go back to the school because dad do not have a job dad be get to move PRON can not everything be go to change and i remember dad do that matter of fact herman literally back to PRON PRON ancestral home up there the woman who always just be a lovely lovely person and become a friend PRON still a person who buy PRON from PRON grandpa die and and PRON just bring back memory PRON come up and PRON say PRON have get to move honey but PRON be go to comb PRON

that be like go to the moon mile PRON know and and PRON do but PRON be until i get a lot old i realize how much must have affect PRON pride have to walk into the kitchen and PRON grandpa finnegan who have four son and and say PRON know can i can i leave gene in the kid here with PRON i promise PRON will pay PRON back PRON will be back i promise can PRON do PRON be not a second thought for PRON grandpa but PRON take a lot of pride for a man or a woman to do that and say can PRON take care of thing can PRON do something and PRON know although be hard for PRON i do not think be hard for PRON grandpa because again PRON family and PRON know PRON have have nothing but great memory about scram climb PRON use to be that foot stonewall marie would have an apple flight son behind the wall climb the flagpole maloney feel i may say the only kid who go to the top PRON generation be PRON know that penny candy the place call sammy be no long city and pepsi and go down to the rudy the ruin of build grier each corner so matinee and then play out the matinee and the way home try to walk across that pipe across the laki PRON know that PRON know because that be what the hero do PRON know sometimes fall in but PRON know there be nothing like good memory but more than the memory what i remember most be i think about as i get old as the value that be instill in PRON up here the point of all this be i look back on PRON be that this be what i learn about loyalty that be what i learn about patriotism that be what i learn about what friendship mean yes i learn about family and faith faith that help PRON get through a lot of tough time of PRON life and a lot of PRON and through tough time and i have know as the philosopher kierkegaard say faith see best in the dark faith see best in the dark well PRON all go through dark time because of the faith be instill in PRON here PRON have be able to traverse PRON well PRON dad make that walk up the stair PRON tell PRON honey everything be go to be okay once PRON get settle in delaware PRON be all go to all go to come down and be together and PRON be PRON dad then in the mid believe everything be go to be okay because the middle

PRON well that be how PRON be raise PRON guess be that be how the bulk of PRON be raise here in scranton wilkes barre area PRON be raise to believe family loyalty treat everyone dignity be what PRON should do because a lot of PRON know PRON be not be like not to be treat with dignity by people with wealth and people who somehow think that PRON be not quite quite PRON equal i can hear PRON now PRON mom i use to stutter badly when i be a kid mom say remember joey nobody be well than PRON but everybody be be equal PRON dad would say not a joke PRON say joey the measure of success be not

PRON get as much as PRON could get do and PRON be important PRON put million people on the roll million people have pre existing condition cover PRON know but PRON do not PRON have to finish the job to ensure that every single american have a choice to be cover by a public option under PRON plan PRON be free to stick with the insurance PRON have to negotiate PRON with PRON company and PRON be like a lot of PRON have go through a long negotiation give up pay raise in order to get thorough coverage under PRON plan PRON get to keep PRON but if PRON do not like PRON or if PRON be uninsured PRON get to sign up to a public option a medicare like proposal PRON plan reduce premium deductible out of pocket cost increase subsidy for middle class family to buy in and for the first time PRON will force private insurance to compete with PRON business not just with each other but with a public competitor and PRON be not PRON be not PRON to make a profit that be what the medicare like option provide PRON be go to keep premium even low bottom line be PRON health care plan be the fastest most effective way to reduce cost for americans give everybody affordable quality health insurance not in five year not in ten year but right now and PRON can the second thing PRON have to rebuild PRON education system as be state at the very beginning by rosemary PRON know PRON wife who be teach PRON whole life be teach at this moment PRON and that be why PRON be not up here with PRON PRON be go to iowa tomorrow but PRON can not be here debra PRON be in the classroom today teaching PRON say PRON good any country that out educate PRON will out compete PRON PRON be a basic thing so in the st century do anybody think year of education be enough to get PRON to in the middle class to be able to stain i do a study for the president PRON ask PRON to do a study on job in the future second of the last year before route six and ten job this moment require something beyond high school degree six and ten PRON get to make sure every child have access to a good education reason of regardless of the zip code that be why PRON as rosemary mention PRON plan triple title one funding for stress less at risk school PRON can afford to do that PRON go from fifteen to forty five billion dollar PRON mean every child will have access to universal pre k and what PRON will apear pre k exponentially increase the prospect that child no matter what PRON background be be go to finish school and go through PRON without get in trouble either with the law already else that mean PRON be go to finally pay teacher that salary PRON deserve PRON know teacher and social work be graduate from school whether say to PRON or wherever PRON be PRON graduate and affordable for year degree PRON get pay less than anybody else graduate as a start and finish salary look the work PRON do be an extreme national importance PRON salary reflect that PRON know that the st century as i say year be not enough under PRON plan everyone who qualify to go to community college be go to be able to go for free PRON say well there go that big spendin democrat right well guess what PRON cost six billion dollar a year to send every qualified person who be go from high school to community college or have to be retrain go back to community college because PRON lose a job because of digitalization and moore law and artificial intelligence and guess what six billion dollar a lot of money PRON eliminate one tax loophole call step up basis there be one point six trillion dollar of loophole in the tax code one point six trillion not the tax code the tax code PRON get PRON get a deduction for racehorse eliminate one of PRON PRON be call step up basis PRON be about to go and cash in a capital gain PRON be figuratively speak and hit by a truck PRON lose PRON life PRON get leave PRON son or daughter PRON do not pay a cent PRON be not a heritage back to the tax owe ten second before PRON get hit well guess what that cost seventeen billion dollar a year eliminate that one loophole but every single solitary person and community college be qualified increase the productivity in this country young people be get crush by the burden of student debt many of PRON parent be as well if PRON be pay back student loan through this PRON call an income base repayment PRON plan be to cut PRON payment be in half the way PRON be do if PRON get out of school and PRON be make less than year to start with PRON do not pay anything back and no interest accrue PRON be still owe PRON and if PRON make more than that PRON be only go to pay five percent of PRON disposable income meaning after all PRON bill be pay and all of PRON cost of living be involve and if PRON commit to national service PRON teacher or

King called it the second emancipation dr. King was one of only two political heroes of mine he and Robert Kennedy his rightful place is alongside the founders of this nation they're still giants though walking among us I know no man more courage than Congressman John Lewis when I see him I can't but I'll think I haven't done enough we haven't done enough John Lewis reminds us we don't celebrate dr. King just for his dream we celebrated for the sacrifices the hard work and the determination and above all for his action one of the lessons from that moment was the transformative change in our country sometimes progress runs fastest when we're at our lowest point sometimes those who fan the flames of hate bring forth the next great wave of progress the bull Connor's of the day don't stay into the streets of fire hoses the dogs they were nice suits they will their power rolling back rights pushing punishing the poor denying access to health care quality education returning away refugees and asylum-seekers today it's not fire hoses it's like that guy carrying the flag with the Trump sign on it it's not snarling dogs that's brought us an inflection point is Donald Trump's poisonous divisionist politics we have a tremendous opportunity to take the next great step forward and racial justice criminal justice domestic justice environmental justice votes we have a chance to rip out the systemic roots of racism in this country to fire phrase dr.

campaign people are talking about a revolution we started a movement we've increased turnout butter-knife turned out for us that can deliver us to a moment where we can do extraordinary extraordinary things look our agenda is bold it's progressive it's a vision where health care is affordable and available to everybody in America where we're big drug prices down under control with no more surprise billing access to hospitals and rural areas as well as urban areas access to care a bold vision we're invest billions of dollars to find and I promise you cures for cancer Alzheimer's and diabetes standing up to a meeting the NRA the gun manufacturers and leading the world to take on the extra sense of that of climate change I'm going to start by rejoining an outfit I helped put together the Paris climate Accord and we're going to move it a long way a country where the quality of education will not depend on your zip code but we tripled funding for low-income school districts providing raises for teachers full-time school for three four and five years old and increasing exponentially the prospects of their success free Community College karate credential for every job with 21st

badly hurt and guess what they're the face of we come from any of you come from it's where we were raised the people there the reason why I'm running there's a reason why I'm a Democrat in the first place these are people we'll build our bridges repair our roads keep our water safe who teach our kids look who race into burning buildings to protect other people who grow our food build our cars

publicly depends every strength look like we did in South Carolina like we did across America today like we'll do on our all the way to the White House look that's why I was so proud yesterday being embraced by Amy Klobuchar we won Minnesota because of Amy global charm and we're doing well in Texas because of better award and that's why that's why I was so proud so incredibly proud to have mayor Pete's endorsement as well there's a man of character intellect and courage and by the way I was proud to be endorsed by Jim Clyburn man he is something else look our campaign reflects the diversity of this party in this nation and that's how it should be because we need to bring everybody along everybody we want to nominate who will beat Donald Trump but also also keep Mansi Pelosi the Speaker of the House went back to United States Senate but that's as you want join us and they want a nominee who's a Democrat a lifelong Democrat a proud Democrat an obama/biden Democrat join us look this all starts with the revival of decency and honor and character Trump has Flair has fanned the flames of hate and sought to divide us he's insulted demonized and actually just wait talks about people he has not a single sense of empathy he doesn't have any compassion no regard for the values that made this country who we are not the way you were raised by your moms and dads he looks at honesty and decency and respect and he used it as a sign of weakness he doesn't believe that we're the beacon to the world he doesn't believe we're all part of something bigger than ourselves that's why I've said from the moment I announced for this candidacy we literally in the battle for the soul of America folks witty means u-19 America not sowing seeds of division and anger and hate we got a beat Donald

now an Irish poet Seamus Heaney who wrote a poem called accurate Rory here's what he says and I believe this to the bottom of my being he said history says don't hope on this side of the grave but then once in a lifetime the longed-for tidal wave of justice rises up and hope and history rhyme we can make hope and history rhyme because what we say there's nothing we can't do this is about the future it's not about the past about our children and our grandchildren it's about leading this country and leading the world once again folks we just have to remember who we are my lord this is the United States of America [Applause] this time for America to get back up and once again fight for the proposition that we hold these truths to be self-evident that all men and women are created equal

Tougaloo is pretty special so much history so much history is made here in this campus so many people stood up for and mobilized and pushed this country forward this is not only my director of the African American engagement on alumnus of this campus not only the n-double-a-cp national president Derek Johnson alumnus and the great Benny Thompson also the incredible fighter for the people of

make sure that Donald Trump is beaten in November [Applause] and I want to talk about all all the incredible local elected officials with us today including the former Secretary of the Navy governor former governor Ray Mabus I'm told Ray's here and thank you all so very much for being here what a difference a week makes week ago the press the punish declared our campaign dead but then came South Carolina and the age some to say then change Super Tuesday today we have 11 victories behind us we need to both delegates and in the national vote and come Tuesday Mississippi is going to get there say well I'm even prouder of though is the level of enthusiasm and excitement this campaign is generating senator Sanders a good guy likes to say we need a record turnout to beat Donald Trump he's absolutely right and where the campaign is going to do it just look at last week in the state of Virginia 70% increase in voter turnout in the primary 16% increase in North Carolina 40% increase in Texas 155 thousand more votes count in South Carolina's primary than four years ago and guess what they voted for us I really believe we're creating a movement and a movement powered by the backbone and base of the Democratic Party movie that's going to defeat Donald Trump and restore the soul of this nation so any of you have been knocked down counted out left behind let me say this this is your campaign so join us at Joe Biden dot-com sign-up volunteer contributor you can't we need you we want you there's a place in this campaign for you folks if you want a nominee who will beat Donald Trump keep the House of Representatives win back to the United States Senate join us one a nominee who's naturally a Democrat a lifelong Democrat a proud Democrat an obama/biden Democrat join us Oana nominee is going to bring this party together who will run a positive progressive vision for America and not turn this primary campaign of negative attacks because that'll only reelect Donald Trump join us look folks we're both on the coalition of the most successful president banking on his all what progress he had and increasingly the most successful present in the lifetime of anybody in this room Barack Obama and we're doing this by bringing together America's very race ethnicity gender an economic station Democrats Republicans and independents of every stripe you know I believe we've been delivered to a moment where he not only can defeat Donald Trump will also have an enormous opportunity if we think big enough bold enough to build a future that this nation and quite frankly the world deserves making sure affordable health care is accessible to every single American lowering drug prices any surprised Billings protecting our rural hospitals that are closing we should do it by building on Obamacare not scrapping it I promised you were going to invest billions of dollars to find cures for cancer Alzheimer's and diabetes standing up and beating the NRA and the gun manufacturers I've done it before and I will do it again and leading the world to take on the existential crisis of our time climate change will start by rejoining an agreement I helped put together the Paris agreement on day one the climate agreement we're going to push all the countries of the world to do more ensuring the quality of our public education doesn't depend on your zip code is another objective and we can do that by tripling funding for low-income school districts providing raises for teachers so they stay not daycare but actual school for three four and five years olds increasing exponentially the prospects of their success and free Community College providing contentions need for the 21st century jobs reducing student debt [Applause] whipping out of wiping out up to $50,000 in student debt for every year you engage in public service restoring America's leadership in the world stage no longer embracing autocrats dictators like Putin and Kim jong-un and we will repair our alliances that are frayed right now and by the way I've had the opportunity because of being around and the jobs I've had as chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee and as doing national security for the President to meet every major world leader in the last 40 years and let me tell you something there's not a single one that I've met and I mean this no exaggeration that wouldn't trade places in a heartbeat with the United States of America we can make it clear to our allies once again we can be trusted Donald Trump Donald Trump treats NATO like it's a protection racket we'll keep our sacred obligation in article five if you give us more money folks building an economy that once again begins doing them one way we've never done it before rewards work not just wealth from making clear do you all know it Wall Street did not build America you build America my mom and dad will America they built the middle class my dad used to have a saying he said Joey had jobs about a lot more than the paycheck it's about your dignity it's about decency my respect it's about your place in the community that's why I'm a Democrat this election isn't a battle for the soul of the Democratic Party it's a battle for the soul of America you know we're an incredibly perilous moment when he mean to 19 America not so a more division and hatred and anger means not only fighting but healing the country presidents have to heal presidents cannot hold grudges presidents have to bring us together we must beat Donald Trump of the Republican Party but we cannot become like them I refuse to accept the proposition that were in an unending war with Republicans if that's the case we get nothing done we have to heal our divisions to repair this democracy and guess what our children are watching and they're listening the world is watching and future generations are going to look back at this moment and know if when it mattered most we literally saved our democracy I never thought my career I'd ever be in a situation where I would talk about our democracy literally being in the balance we can afford God willing if we elect the right person four years of Donald Trump and we can turn it into a aberration in American history but if we allow this man eight years he'll forever and fundamentally change the nature of who we are so folks remember this is the United States of America it's time to get back up once again faith for the proposition that sounds corny we hold these truths to be self-evident that all men and women are created equal endowed by their creator with certain inalienable rights we say it so often we don't focus on it we've never lived up to that assertion what we've never liked this president ever walked away from before I believe with every fiber of my being that's who we are we're unique in all of history America we're the only nation in the world that has been organized on an idea an idea we're unique not based on this you can't define for me what an American is based on race religion ethnicity their national origin it's an idea an idea that we do hold these truths to be self-evident every generation has opened that aperture wider and wider and you know we're a little over a week as my mother Catherine Eugenia Finnegan Biden would tell me st. Patrick's Day so it's only appropriate my colleagues always kidded me in the Senate when I was there than almost quoting Irish poets they think I quote Irish poets because I'm Irish that's not the reason I quote them because the best poets in the world that's why I quoted but a guy that gotten to know by correspondence he recently passed is a guy named Seamus Heaney an Irish poet who wrote a poem called the cure at Troy he has the stands in that poem that I believe is the best way to look at where we are today because I think we have an enormous enormous opportunity after four years of Donald Trump to make such an enormous progress because Trump has ripped a band-aid off he's made it clear how bad the things are that he's proposing now I really mean it I believe it with every fiber of my being but there's a there's a quote from that poem and it says history says don't hope on this side of the grave but then once in a lifetime belong four tidal wave of justice rises up and hope and history rhyme we can make hope and history rhyme of a river who in God's name we are this is the United States America it's within our power it's within our power we have never ever ever ever failed when we've done it together so get up let's take back this country where the United still there's nothing nothing beyond our capacity if we do it together god bless you all and may God protect our troops thank you that it him [Music] down look inside mine in this whole world we walk the line and try to see falling behind [Music] [Music] [Music] so bad everywhere is this [Music] we walk the

47,NdWlxDtt8Qk,biden,2020-03-11T03:04:25Z,I'm about to take the stage from Philadelphia. Tune in to watch live:,speech,we'll continue to do that this is a matter this whole coronavirus issue is a matter of presidential leadership and later this week I'll be speaking to you on what I believe the nation's should be doing to address this virus but tonight I want to speak to you from Philadelphia where we announced our campaign at the front end where we did our final announcement to all those who have been knocked down all those have been counted out left behind this is your campaign just over a week ago many of the pundits declared that this candidacy was dead now we're very much alive although there's a way to go looks like we're gonna have another good night Mississippi is Michigan and we're waiting to hear from North Dakota Idaho and Washington state as I said from the beginning this election is the one that has character on the ballot the character the candidates the character the nation is on the ballot it's more than a comeback in my view our campaign it's a comeback for the soul of this nation this campaign is taking off and I believe we're going to do well from this point on take nothing for granted want to earn every single vote in every single state but if you're willing if you want to join us go to Joe Biden calm Walter and contribute if you can we need you we want you there's a place in our campaign for each of you and I want to thank Bernie Sanders and his supporters for their tireless energy and their passion we share a common goal and together we'll defeat Donald Trump regenerating a Democratic base the Democratic Party the african-american community high school educated folks like the ones I grew up with in Claymont not far from here in my own neighborhood labor suburban women veterans firefighters union members and so many more people of every economic station the poor who are struggling and they are struggling in this environment the middle class worries about whether or not they're going to be able to hang on and stay there maintain their Economic Security they're the reason Jill and I got involved this in this campaign in the first place and they're the reason why I became a Democrat so long ago and I can't tell you I really mean there's some part of my heart I can't tell you how much I appreciate the confidence they've shown in me thus far and the way they turned out to vote for me my first campaign when I was a kid a long time ago I had a billboard that said one thing on it had a picture my wife and children and it said for all our families that's all it was for all our families that included Democratic families families and independent voters Republican families everyone of every stripe for all our families and look that's what we're able to accomplish in South Carolina that's what we did on Super Tuesday and it appears almost a little premature it appears that's we're able to do tonight they're just the past week so many my incredibly capable competitors have endorsed me repeat Buddha jizz Amy Klobuchar better or orc Mike Bloomberg Cory Booker and Kamala Harris together together we're bringing this party together that's what we have to do tonight we are a step closer to restoring decency dignity and honor to the White House that's our ultimate goal and if this moment was so much fear in the country there's so much fear across the world we need American leadership we need presidential leadership that's honest trusted truthful and steady reassuring leadership if I'm given the honor of becoming your president I promise you I'll strive to give the nation that very leadership every day every day I have a privilege the whole office that's the reason why I'm running for president I believe we're in an incredible moment in American history a phenomenal opportunity to deliver a bowl progressive vision to the American people guaranteeing that every American has health care affordable health care total health care building on Obamacare providing every child access to good education regardless of the zip code to deal with the moral depravity of our children who have to learn is to go to school little children to Duck and Cover zigzag down the hallway because they fear someone with a semi-automatic weapon maybe coming in we have to stand up to the gun manufacturers and to the NRA in our case we have to once again lead the world Donald Trump's America first policies made America alone you know and the fight against climate change we have to rally the rest of the world to act and act now rejoin the Paris climate Accord on day one make it clear to our allies that will honor our commitments that our word can be trusted adversaries they will stand fast and restoring world order that's American responsibility tonight I'm speaking from the National Constitution Center not far from where two of the most important documents in all of history were written the Declaration of Independence we hold these truths to be self-evident those words became the American creed known around the world the US Constitution we are the people these words literally changed the world we've never fully lived up to the promise of either those documents but we've never ever before walked away from them and they're a reminder of what's at stake in this election our very democracy is at stake in this election they said from the moment I announced not far from here but I believe were in the battle for the soul of this nation with Donald Trump as president our core values our standing in the world our very democracy everything that has made America America is truly at stake I believe this nation can overcome four years of Donald Trump and given eight four more years he'll forever and fundamentally change the very character of this nation we can't let that happen but winning means but we need means uniting America not sowing more division and anger means having a president not only knows how to fight but knows how to heal replacing the president who demeans and demonizes people with a president who believes in empathy compassion and respect for everyone there's my hope that the days that divisiveness will soon be over we're a decent brave resilient people we are better than this moment we're in we just what we have to do we just need we just need to remember who we are this is the United States of America there's not a single thing we cannot do if we do it together wrong close to the eve of st. Patrick's Day I'm thought of a quote some of you heard me quote many times a fellow that I admired very much who passed away not long ago a poet named Seamus Heaney he wrote a poem called the cure Troy here's what he said in one stands he said history teaches us not to hope on this side of the grave but then once in a lifetime that long for tidal wave of justice rises up and hope and history rhyme i truly believe it's real our power for the first time in a long time because of what's happened in the past three years the power to make hope and history rhyme that's what we're gonna do god bless you all,b we ll continue to do that this be a matter this whole coronavirus issue be a matter of presidential leadership and later this week PRON will be speak to PRON on what i believe the

48,JfBVHeZkVFs,biden,2020-03-25T18:11:44Z,Joe Biden delivers remarks on the impact of the Coronavirus on Young Americans. Tune in:,speech,"and then take a few questions if you would like to ask a question please hit the raise your hand button at the bottom of your screen now I will turn it over to the vice president before I take questions today I'd like to send a message to all the young people out there all across this nation who are they are worried and unsure about what's happening in their lives and and to those who are confused and frustrated by the disruption of a corona virus pandemic that is causing in all our lives particularly there's young Americans a generation has has had a rough run of it lately the Millennials many of whom now are in the prime of their careers came of age at a time defined by 9/11 marked by Wars and then they had some of the hardest long-standing economic impacts of the 200 of the 2008 crisis and the financial collapse and now like all of us they're starting down down a road that is actually staring down a barrel of another major economic crisis the second in their young adult lives Millennials have grown up navigating an enormous disruption and change in society and still they've stepped up all across the board to serve our country whether it's by joining the military becoming doctors teachers nurses public servants by volunteering and their communities with nonprofits it's a remarkable testament to the spirit and feeling of connection to our larger world today a new group of young people referred to as Generation Z is growing up in a time of pervasive anxiety about school shootings crushing debt and politics that seems unresponsive or broken beyond repair now students from grade school to college are being denied months of important milestones and experiences because of this pandemic no spring semester no Spring Break no championship games a year no year-end concerts no graduations and they didn't do anything wrong but especially for those just entering adulthood or launching their careers job opportunities their dreams their dreams have been snatched away look none of us want to be cooped up in our homes just as the weather is turning nice just as Spring Break travel plans for a pro team just as the campaign for the presidency is kicking into high gear it's unfair to all of us and it's unnecessary for all of us but it's necessary in fact it's necessary for all of us to have to deal with it you know we have to stay home because we can transmit live viruses to other people before we feel the signs of sickness ourselves we all have to behave as though we're already infected but based on recent data from the Center for Disease Control all adults including young adults need to practice social distancing self-isolation their own purse for their own personal protection as well and in the cases you know in the US thus far almost 40% of the covent 19 infections or have required hospitalization there are among people who are aged 20 to 50 for people under the age of 60 are not immune to the corona virus young people are not assured to only experience a mild case if you catch it there are no guarantees that you'll not die from it every day we're hearing heart-rending stories of deaths from people in their 20s and their 30s that's why we have to follow the CDC guidelines to minimize the risk of our own exposure to the virus and the slow it spread to others and I have no doubt I have no doubt that all of us including younger the younger generation younger people we're going to step up and make the sacrifices of a few weeks three minimal few months for your for our normal lives to be able to return in order to to beat this virus because this is who we are that's the spirit that is defined America we see it in the millions of young people who are working every day to make their communities better serving others teaching kids to read feeding hungry families mowing the lawn or the buying groceries for the elderly neighbor next door but here's what we must not do we must not allow this pandemic to rob our young people of the futures and the economic opportunities that they've been working so hard to build we need to make sure that our economic recovery does not come at the expense of those who can least afford it or who are just getting started in life these are twin crises the public health crisis is sending older Americans especially hard the economic crisis is hitting younger people all those hard-working young people in service interest seized in retail that are being being decimated by layoffs all those who are hustling to make a living in the gig economy they deserve the same benefits as everyone else does we have to make sure they get them all those who are already struggling to get by before this crisis occurred they're the ones we should be focusing on who are drowning and credit card debt and student loans who are now an even greater need for a lifeline the United States Senate this past there didn't pass this recent agreement on a two trillion dollar support bill to provide critical relief for people and some stability for our economy the largest in our history Democrats did significant work to make sure that working families get critical help now this is a moment where speed matters this bill can keep workers on payrolls that's huge it also offers significant additional support for unemployment insurance you know and and it'll go a long way to provide the financial lifeline for middle income folks if the people if the people who were left out are brought back in it covers those people often get left out the self-employed the gig workers the folks who lost their jobs even before this crisis hit you know it also includes several key pieces that I've been advocating for one is a fund to support states localities as they address the crisis they grant to talk more about that later money to support hospitals and healthcare workers vital support for small businesses an important oversight this is critical important oversight for the 500 billion dollar loan package for corporations but implementing this bill is going to take a whole lot of fly specky and a whole lot of work it's going to require meticulous oversight on a day to day basis it's going to take a lot of coordination with state local governments that's that's what we had to do when I was in charge of executing the Recovery Act which was 900 billion dollars over that that's how we made sure the funds weren't wasted or abused every single day I was on the phone with leaders in each of the states and localities going through the detail of what they had to do we're gonna need to make sure the money gets out quickly into people's pockets and to keep a close watch on how corporations are using the taxpayers funds that they receive to make sure to make sure it goes to helping workers not in rich CEOs or shareholders and then we have to figure out what to do to help the folks this bill leaves out including young people this bill doesn't include student loan forgiveness which would go a long way to provide an immediate relief for those who need it the most i supports for giving at least $10,000 in student loan debt per person now it doesn't include the cost free treatment for the Cova 19 what what what well whatever the costs are relating to that it should be cost free or fully paid sick leave for all our workers which is also critical for the millions of Americans including so many young Americans we're on the front lines of fighting this virus to get this to get us through this doctors nurses delivery drivers grocery store stalkers first responders cleaning crews they've been of the margins of our economy for much too long not being paid enough not having the benefits they deserve and they're all answering the call to duty now in a moment of national need and they deserve leadership that will do the same we need to get more fiscal relief two states on the frontlines like New York State you know Donald Trump downplayed the seriousness of this crisis for weeks and he continues to delay the mobilization of the national resources to deliver life-saving equipment for our doctors our nurses our frontline workers and as a result this virus will hit all of us harder and otherwise might have hit us and it's going to take us longer to recover now he suggesting he wants to get the country opened back over by Easter look we all want to get back to normal as quickly as possible but we have a lot to do to make that possible we have to do it in a smart way to meet not meet some arbitrary or symbolic timeline you know and it would be a catastrophic thing to do for our people and for our economy if we sent people back to work just as we were beginning to see the impact of social distancing take hold only known least a second spike in infections that be far more devastating in the long run and implementing a thorough strategy a thought out strategy supported by science and scientists to get Americans back to work because the only way we'll fully solve the economic challenges is by first solving the public health crisis let me say it again the only way we're gonna be able to do that is by solving the public health crisis first look we're gonna get through this we're gonna get through it together I know we will the capacity of Americans fueled by our young people is boundless and we're going to rely on the energy the innovative spirit of Millennials and generation Z to help rebuild our economy when this is over and it will be so we need a leader in the White House is going to help spur this progress spur our progress all of us empower the next generation of leaders to seize our future of possibilities not to drag us backwards later today I'll be participating in a digital Roundtable with young people so that we can continue to have a real discussion about the issues that matter to our future and they do matter to our future now I'm happy to answer some questions you all may have I know there's a lot more to say but I'll be doing this on a regular basis so thank you and I'm I'm open to questions thank you great our first question will go to Jen Epstein from Bloomberg News and you're unmuted okay thank you hi mr. vice president Jennifer how are you at home like everyone else me too I just wanted to ask we've seen comments from a lot of investors people in Wall Street people like Frank fine suggesting people should get back to work within a couple of weeks which is also something that obviously the president has addressed but are you concerned that investors and corporate leaders are going to be favoring profits over public health in the weeks ahead and and how would you urge them to think about that I virtually think about the science not the science of Wall Street the science of medicine what is it that is going to get us to a place where it's safe for people to go back to work and be interactive in a way that we did in the past rather set some arbitrary date I understand the reason why we want to move and there's a lot of ways we can move if we implement what the Senate is about to pass we're gonna have to do more I hope the Senate passes what we're about to do well with what they've said and the house but we're gonna have to do more beyond that there's a way to infuse into the system to the economy the ability to people to be stable and when this is over to be able to come back in full bore but the idea of arbitrarily setting a time I'd like to be able to say we're going to be back to normal next Friday that'd be wonderful but it can't be arbitrary we got to look at the history what happened the recent histories happened in other countries we saw what it takes to get these under control and we still don't have all the answers so the bottom line is listen to the docs listen to the researchers listen to the invective the infectious disease specialist because we don't do that we're going to find ourselves in a position where we're going to be worse off at the end of the day economically than if we went back too quickly and there are certain places I'm confident you'll be able to open up more access and being able to be less less confined but that's going to be on a case-to-case basis but the idea the whole economy being back to now I can't fathom New York City being that situation or New Orleans or other places that we're going to see a real increase shortly but the science let the science dictate that outcome next up you have Gabe Fisher from wake up to politics hi mr. vice president hey Gabe um so obviously you spent a lot of time today talking about young voters yes like insistently throughout the primaries you've trailed Bernie Sanders among those voters so I'm wondering as you turn to the general election what concrete steps and policy changes you're planning on making to try to reach out to those younger Americans well first of all this is about what I'm talking about today is making sure that your generation I'm assuming you're somewhere between eighteen and thirty eighteen that your generation doesn't end up behind the eight ball because you get hurt by this so badly you can't ever when you get out of school be able to move and so for example I've strongly believe there's a need for us to as it relates to the help is needed now to for the economy in your generation is I think there should be a ten thousand dollar forgiveness of student loans across the board for anyone who is in fact affected now from this point on as we fight this pandemic so when we fund money we find my money to do that number two I think it's vitally important that we have a healthcare proposal that's why I'm strongly arguing that this administration dropped their attempt to do away in court with Obamacare with and we build on Obamacare immediately to be able to provide for all the economic impact that is going to be required from a health care system that people don't have to bear that themselves it can be paid for and they know how do they know it's going to be paid for thirdly we're gonna have an opportunity I believe in the next round here to use the my green economy my Green Deal or to be able to generate both economic growth and consistent with the kind of infusion of monies we need into the system to keep it going one of the ways to make sure these jobs are available that may get lost or hurt in the meantime is to provide the kind of jobs that are prevailing wages where people are making forty five fifty dollars an hour plus benefits by building new infrastructure we're going to need new infrastructure going down the road here and it's a way to generate economic growth that's gonna be I think the next round we have to be looking at in addition to that I think is really important we take a look at what it is that is going to allow you to be in a position that you can in fact be in a position to have a live a a gainful life I've said for a long time if we were setting up an education system for the first time in our history as we did at the turn alas in the late 1800s we would not say twelve years was enough twelve years is not not enough to live in a - in the twenty the second quarter of the middle of the 21st century and be able to live and no you're going to be able to compete you know you have right now you have a significant number of jobs requiring six out of ten jobs are crying more than a high school education just to get the jobs that were there before this coronavirus hit and so I think that we should provide not only for that post high school but pre grade school I think we should be tripling the amount of money we provide for school districts that I have low income basis title 1 schools from 15 to 45 billion dollars a year that would allow teacher pay to go up because your generation and the one between you and the people are up to 45 there they're not going to understand education anymore they can't compete because if they graduate if they graduate Magnum laude from a great university with an education degree they get paid somewhere about 22% less to start than anybody else except a social worker and so what we have to do is we have to increase teachers pay at the front end to keep people from the school some having do we already have a short shortage of 115,000 teachers right now by 2025 will be about a quarter of a million and that just means more difficulty in terms of reaching children and so they can reach their potential secondly we would be able to put every single child age 3 4 & 5 in school not take care of school and all the studies of the great universities show that increases by well over 50% their prospects of going all the way through high school and Beyond by over 56% it's a smart investment now and at the tail end I've been proposing that we have free college as excuse me free community college education I thought for spending 70 billion dollars on HBCUs over the next 10 years and in addition to that I think if you're going to a public university in your state it should be free free for everyone that's how it should be and you should not end up with some gigantic debt like my kids did when they graduated and so the circumstances are across the board but mostly we have to prepare you so you're not carrying an overwhelming burden that when you get out of school when you go through what in it and not just going to college trade schools and the whole deal because we have to reach out more there are a lot of jobs out there that are going to be available in the near term that in fact people aren't aren't equipped for aren't equipped for and so that's they're there and there's more but we also should be talking about any who in fact has a student debt if in fact they're engaged in public service teaching school the you know the joining a volunteers organization that provide food and shelter for people across the board that they get forgiven past debt or debt that they would incur ten thousand dollars per year up to fifty thousand dollars that would cover virtually everyone now if you're going to if you have seven years of private school debt college debt then it's not going to cover that but it will get a big chunk of it and the other thing we do is there's a lot of students and I hope you're not part of it because it's a more of a disadvantage who come from a circumstance where their families have less than fifty thousand dollars in income well Barack and I have the President Obama increased Pell grants in terms of the amount of money you get for Pell Grant I would make sure that we double the Pell Grant funding so that is not enough to give a free tuition to someone if they can't get there if they can't eat if they had no place to sleep no room and board in effect and so I double Pell grants to $12,000 a year and and then there are things beyond that are going to affect your generation a lot I think we should be putting fifty billion dollars in heavy research through NIH on dealing with the big killers diabetes Alzheimer's and cancer and and so there's a lot we can do but you know I when I left the United States Senate I became a professor at the University of Pennsylvania and I've spent a lot of time and the University of Delaware has the Biden school there as well so I spent a lot of time on campus with college students but it's not just college students it's those hard-working kids getting out of school that in fact high school that aren't going to college or don't want to go to college you want to go to trade school we got to equip them I know I'm taking a long time and answering this but but I think it's really important we don't want you settled the way the generation after 9/11 and at to the economic downturn in 2008 got South thank you for your time thank you for your question great next up we have Alexander Jaffe from AP I'm mr. vice president um I have two quick ones for you one you've been speaking about your outreach to congressional leadership and I was wondering if you could share a little bit more details on that are you advising them giving them suggestions or just sort of checking in and hearing how things are going and then - you've been criticizing President Trump for his response sort of the slowness of the response for weeks now but a few recent polls suggest that public approval has actually increased of the president's sort of job performance that I I wonder why you think the public doesn't see his leadership the same way as you do well I'm not suggesting what the public sees about his leadership let me take the last question first what I'm suggesting is that I know what has to be done in that in the following that faster is better than slower for example way back in January 17th I argued that this virus was coming I did a a I think was US News and World Report I did a piece on saying it's coming we got to prepare we didn't do much at all number one number two I think it's really important that we understand that the this idea of this defense production act he talks about sign it he doesn't want to dictate to companies there's things we need now now not tomorrow not yesterday but months ago or a month ago and the president's not acting now IIIi don't I don't care whether the president's numbers are going up and down I know along with everybody else was ever dealt with these kinds of things like we did in our administration that time is of the essence time is of the essence and so that's the that's the last part of your question and yes I have been talking to governor's mayor's congressional leaders as well as members of and I've been doing three things one asking their input with their seen what they're dealing with what their problems are particularly with regard to the governor's and the mayor's and to asking members of the House and Senate what they think is the most element important elements that they think have to be included in the legislation and three then when asked and I've been asked offering what I think should be part of it but I'm not second-guessing it here in the sense that I'm no longer in the Senate obviously but there are things that I think that we should be doing more of and but I think the Democrats in the Senate got as much of what needs to be done in as they could possibly get we can't wait lot longer we're gonna need to come back at this we're gonna have to come back at this and deal with focuses that will focus on those state and local aid that isn't going to be needed as this crisis continues and it's needed now I think we should be employing right now the legislation that's available the president immerses he said he's a wartime president well act like one there's things you can do right now to make sure all those ventilators get out to make sure that those master there to make sure for example I would even think about the idea is you know include with this but you know III was asked to manage the nine hundred million dollar Recovery Act in 18 months which most we did manage and it got out I think most people would say it saved us from going into a depression and that it was done but it required day-to-day oversight with one person in charge the president asked me to be in charge I was able I was able to text or not text I was able to task the entire administration to work for me but we're on the phone with every governor most every mayor every there was one governor all 49 governor's put it that way and and what happened was that they'd have ideas well how can I use the money I want to do this well no you can't do that there's you got to do this well I think under the law I can do that and I'd say well you're gonna go ahead and do that I'm gonna come out and tell the public and you're saying I'm going to hold a press conference saying I think you use the money unwisely and we have you have to have someone watching it every day and I had a full-time staff with me of serious serious people doing nothing in managing this day-to-day and that's what's gonna have to happen for example let's take a look at what's going to happen here in terms of getting our small business loans well there's money in here for small business loans well banks traditionally aren't real big on dealing with and have the personnel to deal with small business loans so it could take a long time to get that done but that's the single most urgent need we have and so if banks are not able to handle that if I were president I would be in fact using the the wartime legislation to insist that they focus on that that's much more important in terms of economic recover than anything else we're doing in addition to aid to the states so it's all about urgency and I noticed that the president's numbers of the public have gone up and handling this crisis but they haven't gone up in terms of his presidency Gallup did show he is now at 49% job approval which is a reversal from a few weeks ago so it's just an interesting development it does suggest that the American people see him as a stronger leader than you've been maybe characterizing him well I hope that he does he's so strong that is up way above that because we need the help now we need help now great thank you we have time for one more question Arlette from CNN Vice President Biden morning I have two quick questions for you you talked about your conversations that you've had with lawmakers here in the US have you had any conversations with foreign leaders given your existing relationships with them about the coronavirus and secondly Bernie Sanders campaign has said that he would debate if there was a debate in April do you think there should be another debate in April in which you participate my focus is just dealing with this crisis right now thought about anymore debates I think we've had enough debates I think we should get on with this but with regard to speaking to foreign leaders I haven't spoken with a foreign leader in the last probably two weeks who was the last foreign leader that you spoke what did you talk about coronavirus at all I talked about how it affected their country but no I'm not gonna I it was an off-the-record discussion I had so I'm not gonna indicate you and do you have any concerns about breaking through throughout all of this coronavirus coverage the news cycle I mean this is the first time that there's a real public crisis that you haven't been in office with decision-making authority are you concerned at all about getting your message across well you know I I was because but I'm finding out that what you've mastered along before me that the new technologies are quite effective I noticed that for example I noticed that when I laid out my plan a couple days three days ago or four days ago that it didn't get covered on the National Nets but I found out three point eight people 3.8 million people watched it online so I'm learning a lot more about how to get the message out in terms of beyond what we're doing as a matter of fact I think we're both sitting in our own homes with I don't know you in the studio are you at home yeah well anyway I'm I'm at home they had to set up it took it took about four days to be able to have the power and the capacity to set up in my recreation room where I'm sitting now the ability to communicate like I am now so I think there's plenty of opportunity to communicate and but I have to tell you arm I find I just like anybody who cares about this I I'm chomping at the bit I wish I were still in the Senate you know being able to impact on some of these things but what I am where I am and I hope to be the nominee of the Democratic Party and I hope I'm able to get my message across as we go forward but my main focus believe it or not is not a political focus my main focus now is to make sure we handle this crisis well so we don't left with a legacy and a whole lot of deadweight we have to carry through the next 10 years great thank you that concludes our press briefing as always please feel free to reach out to our press team and have a great rest of your day thank you thank you all",b and then take a few question if PRON would like to ask a question please hit the raise PRON hand button at the bottom of PRON screen now i will turn PRON over to the vice president before i

PRON send people back to work just as PRON be begin to see the impact of social distancing take hold only know least a second spike in infection that be far more devastating in the long run and implement a thorough strategy a thought out strategy support by science and scientist to get americans back to work because the only way PRON will fully solve the economic challenge be by first solve the public health crisis let PRON say PRON again the only way PRON be go to be able to do that be by solve the public health crisis first look PRON be go to get through this PRON be go to get through PRON together i know PRON will the capacity of americans fuel by PRON young people be boundless and PRON be go to rely on the energy the innovative spirit of millennial and generation z to help rebuild PRON economy when this be over and PRON will be so PRON need a leader in the white house be go to help spur this progress spur PRON progress all of PRON empower the next generation of leader to seize PRON future of possibility not to drag PRON backwards later today PRON will be participate in a digital roundtable with young people so that PRON can continue to have a real discussion about the issue that matter to PRON future and PRON do matter to PRON future now PRON be happy to answer some question PRON all may have i know there be a lot more to say but PRON will be do this on a regular basis so thank PRON and PRON be PRON be open to question thank PRON great PRON first question will go to jen epstein from bloomberg news and PRON be unmuted okay thank PRON hi mr vice president jennifer how be PRON at home like everyone else PRON too i just want to ask PRON have see comment from a lot of investor people in wall street people like frank fine suggest people should get back to work within a couple of week which be also something that obviously the president have address but be PRON concerned that investor and corporate leader be go to be favor profit over public health in the week ahead and and how would PRON urge PRON to think about that i virtually think about the science not the science of wall street the science of medicine what be PRON that be go to get PRON to a place where PRON be safe for people to go back to work and be interactive in a way that PRON do in the past rather set some arbitrary date i understand the reason why PRON want to move and there be a lot of way PRON can move if PRON implement what the senate be about to pass PRON be go to have to do more i hope the senate pass what PRON be about to do well with what PRON have say and the house but PRON be go to have to do more beyond that there be a way to infuse into the system to the economy the ability to people to be stable and when this be over to be able to come back in full bore but the idea of arbitrarily set a time PRON would like to be able to say PRON be go to be back to normal next friday that d be wonderful but PRON can not be arbitrary PRON get to look at the history what happen the recent history happen in other country PRON see what PRON take to get these under control and PRON still do not have all the answer so the bottom line be listen to the doc listen to the researcher listen to the invective the infectious disease specialist because PRON do not do that PRON be go to find PRON in a position where PRON be go to be bad off at the end of the day economically than if PRON go back too quickly and there be certain place PRON be confident PRON will be able to open up more access and be able to be less less confined but that be go to be on a case to case basis but the idea the whole economy be back to now i can not fathom new york city be that situation or new orleans or other place that PRON be go to see a real increase shortly but the science let the science dictate that outcome next up PRON have gabe fisher from wake up to politic hi mr vice president hey gabe um so obviously PRON spend a lot of time today talk about young voter yes like insistently throughout the primary PRON have trail bernie sander among those voter so PRON be wonder as PRON turn to the general election what concrete step and policy change PRON be plan on make to try to reach out to those young americans well first of all this be about what PRON be talk about today be make sure that PRON generation PRON be assume PRON be somewhere between eighteen and thirty eighteen that PRON generation do not end up behind the eight ball because PRON get hurt by this so badly PRON can not ever when PRON get out of school be able to move and so for example PRON have strongly believe there be a need for PRON to as PRON relate to the help be need now to for the economy in PRON generation be i think there should be a ten thousand dollar forgiveness of student loan across the board for anyone who be in fact affect now from this point on as PRON fight this pandemic so when PRON fund money PRON find PRON money to do that number two i think PRON be vitally important that PRON have a healthcare proposal that be why PRON be strongly argue that this administration drop PRON attempt to do away in court with obamacare with and PRON build on obamacare immediately to be able to provide for all the economic impact that be go to be require from a health care system that people do not have to bear that PRON PRON can be pay for and PRON know how do PRON know PRON be go to be pay for thirdly PRON be go to have an opportunity i believe in the next round here to use the PRON green economy PRON green deal or to be able to generate both economic growth and consistent with the kind of infusion of monie PRON need into the system to keep PRON go one of the way to make sure these job be available that may get lose or hurt in the meantime be to provide the kind of job that be prevail wage where people be make forty five fifty dollar an hour plus benefit by build new infrastructure PRON be go to need new infrastructure go down the road here and PRON be a way to generate economic growth that be go to be i think the next round PRON have to be look at in addition to that i think be really important PRON take a look at what PRON be that be go to allow PRON to be in a position that PRON can in fact be in a position to have a live a a gainful life PRON have say for a long time if PRON be set up an education system for the first time in PRON history as PRON do at the turn alas in the late s PRON would not say twelve year be enough twelve year be not not enough to live in a in the twenty the second quarter of the middle of the st century and be able to live and no PRON be go to be able to compete PRON know PRON have right now PRON have a significant number of job require six out of ten job be cry more than a high school education just to get the job that be there before this coronavirus hit and so i think that PRON should provide not only for that post high school but pre grade school i think PRON should be triple the amount of money PRON provide for school district that i have low income basis title school from to billion dollar a year that would allow teacher pay to go up because PRON generation and the one between PRON and the people be up to there PRON be not go to understand education anymore PRON can not compete because if PRON graduate if PRON graduate magnum laude from a great university with an education degree PRON get pay somewhere about less to start than anybody else except a social worker and so what PRON have to do be PRON have to increase teacher pay at the front end to keep people from the school some have do PRON already have a short shortage of teacher right now by will be about a quarter of a million and that just mean more difficulty in term of reach child and so PRON can reach PRON potential secondly PRON would be able to put every single child age in school not take care of school and all the study of the great university show that increase by well over PRON prospect of go all the way through high school and beyond by over PRON be a smart investment now and at the tail end PRON have be propose that PRON have free college as excuse PRON free community college education i think for spend billion dollar on hbcus over the next year and in addition to that i think if PRON be go to a public university in PRON state PRON should be free free for everyone that be how PRON should be and PRON should not end up with some gigantic debt like PRON kid do when PRON graduate and so the circumstance be across the board but mostly PRON have to prepare PRON so PRON be not carry an overwhelming burden that when PRON get out of school when PRON go through what in PRON and not just go to college trade school and the whole deal because PRON have to reach out more there be a lot of job out there that be go to be available in the near term that in fact people be not be not equip for be not equip for and so that be PRON be there and there be more but PRON also should be talk about any who in fact have a student debt if in fact PRON be engage in public service teach school the PRON know the join a volunteer organization that provide food and shelter for people across the board that PRON get forgive past debt or debt that PRON would incur ten thousand dollar per year up to fifty thousand dollar that would cover virtually everyone now if PRON be go to if PRON have seven year of private school debt college debt then PRON be not go to cover that but PRON will get a big chunk of PRON and the other thing PRON do be there be a lot of student and i hope PRON be not part of PRON because PRON be a more of a disadvantage who come from a circumstance where PRON family have less than fifty thousand dollar in income well barack and i have the president obama increase pell grant in term of the amount of money PRON get for pell grant i would make sure that PRON double the pell grant funding so that be not enough to give a free tuition to someone if PRON can not get there if PRON can not eat if PRON have no place to sleep no room and board in effect and so i double pell grant to $ a year and and then there be thing beyond that be go to affect PRON generation a lot i think PRON should be put fifty billion dollar in heavy research through nih on deal with the big killer diabete alzheimer and cancer and and so there be a lot PRON can do but PRON know i when i leave the united states senate i become a professor at the university of pennsylvania and PRON have spend a lot of time and the university of delaware have the biden school there as well so i spend a lot of time on campus with college student but PRON be not just college student PRON be those hard work kid get out of school that in fact high school that be not go to college or do not want to go to college PRON want to go to trade school PRON get to equip PRON i know PRON be take a long time and answer this but but i think PRON be really important PRON do not want PRON settle the way the generation after and at to the economic downturn in get south thank PRON for PRON time thank PRON for PRON question great next up PRON have alexander jaffe from ap PRON be mr vice president um i have two quick one for PRON one PRON have be speak about PRON outreach to congressional leadership and i be wonder if PRON could share a little bit more detail on that be PRON advise PRON give PRON suggestion or just sort of check in and hear how thing be go and then PRON have be criticize president trump for PRON response sort of the slowness of the response for week now but a few recent poll suggest that public approval have actually increase of the president sort of job performance that i i wonder why PRON think the public do not see PRON leadership the same way as PRON do well PRON be not suggest what the public see about PRON leadership let PRON take the last question first what PRON be suggest be that i know what have to be do in that in the following that faster be well than slow for example way back in january th i argue that this virus be come i do a a i think be us news and world report i do a piece on say PRON be come PRON get to prepare PRON do not do much at all number one number two i think PRON be really important that PRON understand that the this idea of this defense production act PRON talk about sign PRON PRON do not want to dictate to company there be thing PRON need now now not tomorrow not yesterday but month ago or a month ago and the president be not act now iiii do not i do not care whether the president number be go up and down i know along with everybody else be ever deal with these kind of thing like PRON do in PRON administration that time be of the essence time be of the essence and so that be the that be the last part of PRON question and yes i have be talk to governor mayor congressional leader as well as member of and PRON have be do three thing one ask PRON input with PRON see what PRON be deal with what PRON problem be particularly with regard to the governor and the mayor and to ask member of the house and senate what PRON think be the most element important element that PRON think have to be include in the legislation and three then when ask and PRON have be ask offer what i think should be part of PRON but PRON be not second guess PRON here in the sense that PRON be no longer in the senate obviously but there be thing that i think that PRON should be do more of and but i think the democrats in the senate get as much of what need to be do in as PRON could possibly get PRON can not wait lot longer PRON be go to need to come back at this PRON be go to have to come back at this and deal with focus that will focus on those state and local aid that be not go to be need as this crisis continue and PRON be need now i think PRON should be employ right now the legislation that be available the president immerse PRON say PRON be a wartime president well act like one there be thing PRON can do right now to make sure all those ventilator get out to make sure that those master there to make sure for example i would even think about the idea be PRON know include with this but PRON know iii be ask to manage the nine hundred million dollar recovery act in month which most PRON do manage and PRON get out i think most people would say PRON save PRON from go into a depression and that PRON be do but PRON require day to day oversight with one person in charge the president ask PRON to be in charge i be able i be able to text or not text i be able to task the entire administration to work for PRON but PRON be on the phone with every governor most every mayor every there be one governor all governor put PRON that way and and what happen be that PRON would have idea well how can i use the money i want to do this well no PRON can not do that there be PRON get to do this well i think under the law i can do that and PRON would say well PRON be go to go ahead and do that PRON be go to come out and tell the public and PRON be say PRON be go to hold a press conference say i think PRON use the money unwisely and PRON have PRON have to have someone watch PRON every day and i have a full time staff with PRON of serious serious people do nothing in manage this day to day and that be what be go to have to happen for example let PRON take a look at what be go to happen here in term of get PRON small business loan well there be money in here for small business loan well bank traditionally be not real big on deal with and have the personnel to deal with small business loan so PRON could take a long time to get that do but that be the single most urgent need PRON have and so if bank be not able to handle that if i be president i would be in fact use the the wartime legislation to insist that PRON focus on that that be much more important in term of economic recover than anything else PRON be do in addition to aid to the state so PRON be all about urgency and i notice that the president number of the public have go up and handle this crisis but PRON have not go up in term of PRON presidency gallup do show PRON be now at job approval which be a reversal from a few week ago so PRON be just an interesting development PRON do suggest that the american people see PRON as a strong leader than PRON have be maybe characterize PRON well i hope that PRON do PRON be so strong that be up way above that because PRON need the help now PRON need help now great thank PRON PRON have time for one more question arlette from cnn vice president biden morning i have two quick question for PRON PRON talk about PRON conversation that PRON have have with lawmaker here in the us have PRON have any conversation with foreign leader give PRON exist relationship with PRON about the coronavirus and secondly bernie sander campaign have say that PRON would debate if there be a debate in april do PRON think there should be another debate in april in which PRON participate PRON focus be just deal with this crisis right now think about anymore debate i think PRON have have enough debate i think PRON should get on with this but with regard to speak to foreign leader i have not speak with a foreign leader in the last probably two week who be the last foreign leader that PRON speak what do PRON talk about coronavirus at all i talk about how PRON affect PRON country but no PRON be not go to i PRON be an off the record discussion i have so PRON be not go to indicate PRON and do PRON have any concern about break through throughout all of this coronavirus coverage the news cycle i mean this be the first time that there be a real public crisis that PRON have not be in office with decision make authority be PRON concerned at all about get PRON message across well PRON know i i be because but PRON be find out that what PRON have master along before PRON that the new technology be quite effective i notice that for example i notice that when i lay out PRON plan a couple day three day ago or four day ago that PRON do not get cover on the national net but i find out three point eight people million people watch PRON online so PRON be learn a lot more about how to get the message out in term of beyond what PRON be do as a matter of fact i think PRON be both sit in PRON own home with i do not know PRON in the studio be PRON at home yeah well anyway PRON be PRON be at home PRON have to set up PRON take PRON take about four day to be able to have the power and the capacity to set up in PRON recreation room where PRON be sit now the ability to communicate like i be now so i think there be plenty of opportunity to communicate and but i have to tell PRON arm i find i just like anybody who care about this i PRON be chomp at the bit i wish i be still in the senate PRON know be able to impact on some of these thing but what i be where i be and i hope to be the nominee of the democratic party and i hope PRON be able to get PRON message across as PRON go forward but PRON main focus believe PRON or not be not a political focus PRON main focus now be to make sure PRON handle this crisis well so PRON do not leave with a legacy and a whole lot of deadweight PRON have to carry through the next year great thank PRON that conclude PRON press briefing as always please feel free to reach out to PRON press team and have a great rest of PRON day thank PRON thank PRON all
49,4PEkEc1ZFBs,biden,2020-04-02T21:16:46Z,Joe Biden Delivers Remarks on Implementation & Oversight of CARES Act | Joe Biden For President,speech,good afternoon ladies and gentlemen thank you again for joining us the Vice President will give brief remarks and then he'll take a few questions if you'd like to ask a question please hit the raise your hand button at the bottom of your screen but first I'd like to turn it over to the vice president thanks everybody for getting on this side on this broadcast look it's a it's a good afternoon but it's a tough afternoon this morning we received more devastating news for American workers a record high in new unemployment claims 6.6 million more in one week added to the 3.3 million claims from last week that's almost 10 million Americans who through no fault of their own have lost their job because of this pandemic 10 million proud hardworking Americans who need help now more than they've ever needed who are about how they're gonna make their worry about the rent they're worried about how they're just going to get the next meal worried about how they're gonna pay the bills to keep the food on the table and above all worried about the health for themselves and their loved ones and their neighbors my heart goes out each and every family who is struggling to get through this time of unprecedented national crisis and I I think along with dozens of other elected officials if not hundreds of public health officials Democrats and Republicans are calling for President Trump and his administration to do the right thing and open up a new enrollment period for Obamacare so that people who need insurance now can get it now is not the time for petty politics this is a national emergency our government should be doing everything possible to protect people's health and well-being and the good news is the US government took important action last week passing the law a two trillion dollar cares Act it was the namesake of you know remarkable feat of bipartisanship that that Nancy and Schumer and I and the Republican leaders put together to just the real national crisis and Democrats made sure provided reassurances and relief for American workers but now President Trump has to make sure it's implemented swiftly transparently and effectively yesterday the Trump administration suggested that I should call the president offer to help well I'm happy to hear he'll take my call my team's working with him to set such a call up and I've been offering my advice and proposing policies for what I thought should be done for the last several weeks I said back on March 12th when I released my initial plan for covin 19 that the president welcomed adopt every single thing I suggested he thought was worthwhile and I wouldn't be anything about except complement him for the job he was doing today I make the same offer with regard to my new ten point make it work checklist I've done this work before I can tell you it takes more than tweets and press conferences it's hard it's painstaking work this is what leaders have to lead and governments have to work I was in charge of administering the eight hundred billion dollar Recovery Act so understand that the devil is in the details it's about follow-through the cares Act provides more money tell people now how do we make sure it gets to those people as quickly as possible and what those little red tape as possible know there's money to help keep small businesses afloat how do we make sure the small businesses get access to those funds so they can make rent and keep workers on the payroll there's money for large corporations how do we make sure that there's a rigorous oversight to ensure it is used to help workers not enrich top executives are well-off investors those are the kinds of questions that the president should be asking now and he's responsible for that and frankly it doesn't have he doesn't hadn't had a great record so far when it comes to the delivery real help to the American people in timely fashion I hope this time is different he may not like it but being president is about taking responsibility the blame game can't cut it in this crisis too many lives are at stake there have been too many there's this look we have to be clear with our objectives and our timelines and the benchmarks there should be one person responsible accountable for making sure things are coordinated and done correctly there must be transparency at every step of the way I'm releasing a full checklist on Joe Biden calm is it's just a starting point but let me offer a few highlights we need to get the unemployment insurance checks out as quickly as possible and in full now that sounds simple but states are already overwhelmed by the millions of claims they've never had this many at one time with more to come states need more staff to administer those offices better technology more robust systems to both accept claims and get funds out the door the white house the white house should have the backs their states through the backs of the states not just taken it's the responsibility of the white house from the federal government to help look the promise of the Cure's Act is that your average worker will be made financially whole even if they lose the job the president has to deliver on that promise he should immediately stand up a team with empowered that's empowered with a senior leadership to help States solve challenges that they inevitably are gonna face distributing you unemployment benefits you know he should give them all the resources they need to increase the capacity to do that he should issue clear guidance about the broadest possible eligibility to south including gig workers and those furloughed they are qualified as well so working Americans understand that help that is available to them is available and how to get it and how to access it this is there's no time to lose this is going to be difficult but it has to happen now we have to make sure all small businesses for example get help fast so they can keep people on the payroll you know it does no good for Congress to move quickly if the administration can't get the these loans to small businesses that are in need now for millions of American workers payday is tomorrow tomorrow every single eligible small business needs to be able to access the help access to help regardless of how small they are whether they're in the suburbs are struggling in an urban community or in a small rural town women-owned businesses minority-owned businesses the money should be going out the door as fast as possible not just to the well-connected not just to a few splashy Lea announced examples look to all who qualify that's what has to be everybody who qualifies as it's designed the program depends on the willingness of the private banks to provide government back they're not they're not taking the risk governor's back in the loans government back loans and these small businesses but that's not been their strong point in the past that's why I'm calling for a bank defense production act authority to make sure that the wide range of banks are processing loans for all those who qualify within a few working days of application they can turn qualified applicants that they can't turn qualified applicants away but they can determine who's qualified or put them at the back of the line it's also calling for moving the cap on this funding so that no eligible small business or nonprofit is left behind look the governor is providing the guarantees now the banks have to step up and do their part I know it's going to be hard but they have to step up we also need to keep people on the payroll by using work-sharing authorities so the full extent of the law that is you have two workers you each go in half time that each entitle to be get unemployment so they're as if they're being paid full-time the wife outage should expand the work sharing program to all 50 states the District of Columbia Puerto Rico the US Virgin Islands these programs help employer keep employer's keep more workers employed with the federal government making up the difference in lost hours an additional $600 for laid off workers and the cares Act should also be available to encourage work sharing to help keep workers employed every person every person on work sharing is another person still in a job this is going to take bold create a federal action in partnership with the states and they should get to work we need to get direct cash relief payments out to as many people as possible as quickly as possible again this may sound straightforward but no American should have to wait a single minute so Donald Trump can put his signature on a physical check it isn't about him it's about families that need the cash now payments should be electronically made or via prepaid debit card and they should be going out the door now when it comes to protecting against waste and abuse either by corporations of this administration we can't take the cup off the beat Donald Trump has threatened to block the work of the special inspector general that Congress created to oversee the 500 billion dollar fund for corporations the idea of taking that authority way is simply unacceptable as I said I oversaw an eight hundred billion dollar program the biggest recovery ever passed before this one and it was hard work to make sure there was no less than two-tenths of one percent fraud when it got all finished that's what it was less than two-tenths of one percent fraud or abuse but we did it and it mattered because every dollar wasted doesn't get to a worker or a family who badly needs it you know we can't let that happen the president has to give the expectant Inspector General free rein and full transparency if he won't Congress has to hold the president accountable in addition Democrats want important oversight protections against the money being used for stock buybacks or executive compensation but the administration can and should set the bar even higher I've laid out a number of conditions to make sure companies aren't taking the money and then turning around and firing workers outsourcing jobs finally start working on phase four we need another plan before this is over we've gone through the first three phases we're trying to implement phase three two and three now we can't wait though the tragedy of this crisis that's how much pain could have been avoided with swift decisive action we've already know we're gonna need more resources a lot more more people are gonna need to help we're gonna gaps are going to become apparent we're gonna need to fix them and fill them some people were left out of the cares Act we'll need to help them as well America's long-term recovery is going to require far more investment but it needs to be smart and effective so let's start now so we don't waste valuable time that's how this administration can make it work and make it work for all the American people not just big businesses and corporate executives families struggling to make rent workers are laid who you know have had their hours slashed never laid off our frontline health care heroes who can't wait for help and above all this administration still needs to set up his response to the public health crisis including getting Hospital and health care funding in the cares Act out the door to the hospitals and health care folks for time President was talking about this crisis being a choice between protecting public health and reopening the economy that was a false and dangerous way to think about the problem the virus is why we're having and I'm we have this economic crisis failure to rest the spread of the virus is the direct cause of economic pain Americans are suffering today this instant some so you know nobody nobody there's none of us who will think this matters no amount of relief will help families ride out this and we can't break this infects of this infection curve and break it quickly to stop the spread of the virus and save American lives that's priority number one so thank you all thank you all for taking time to listen I know there's a lot I haven't spoken to but I'm happy to try to take your questions now thank you very much thank you sir we are now gonna start taking questions people like to ask a question just remember to please raise your hand at the bottom of the screen the first question will go to Andrea Mitchell from NBC Andrea you are her now i'm youjin or honor thank you very much hello thank you but mr. vice president we are seeing heartbreaking appeal from the frontline health workers all over the country especially in New York City which is the crux of the problem right now and the governors are telling us Democratic and Republican governors are saying they still are not getting supplies still there's no one from FEMA who seems to be in charge can you say what you would tell the president if he does take your call about what needs to be done to get this aid the protective gear the equipment they need to these hospitals to or frontline health workers to be EMS workers and secondly you're calling for a fourth package but Senator McConnell has said he's not interested in a Nancy Pelosi told me today she's already ready and working on it what would you say to the Republican leadership and to the White House about the need for a fourth package well let me start at the front end you know I have a son-in-law Ashley's her husband is a surgeon up in Philadelphia one of the big hospitals and I talk to him every day with other health care providers and experts and he was telling about a friend of his up in New York who is said he just had two young men die on his table one was I think 26 years old and I think a marathoner don't hold me that in great shape know there was 28 years old this is only going to get worse it's not going to get better and there's a real sense of panic that's occurring around the country and among some I won't say panic great concern among healthcare providers and first responders so number one we're in a situation where the president as I was coming down to this makeshift studio I was told by a staff member that the president says he's going to fully implement the defense production act now and so I said great and I state a second as well as a few minutes later I said what'd he say and I read the statement it's all about ventilators which is really important and should have been done four weeks ago but he should employ that defense production act for all the things needed gloves masks face shields gowns etc that should be be done yesterday last week a month ago get it done now and for example tests we're in a situation where we have tests that are not being distributed number one because there's no one person no commander and the White House or the administration like a military commander this determining distribution of what is available and we have to be in point we have to be used in the defense production Act to get companies who have the capacity to gather all the materials needed for the tests assemble them and move now use your full authority this is a war act like a commander-in-chief use it all and so I I'm a little worried that that has not been expanded and you know the health care workers and I watch your interviews and everyone else's interviews on TV and there's so many examples of these I watched last night a young doctor saying how friendly was the Glenda theme room but he said he thought about how soldiers go in and so he why didn't he have more courage he's gonna do it but it's frightening to go in and Dada people are really worried let's get on the job providing what is needed you asked the third part of your question related to whether or not what was the third part of your question actually you asked three pieces all right would it was the question about whether or not a fourth package I'm sorry yes yes the majority leader in the Senate is saying no well the majority of the Senate was wrong and slow the first time around and he's wrong and slow this time around look you know Morse has to happen there is no possibility that the monies that provided for to try to just get this under control are going to be enough to deal with the aftermath both economically and in terms of the health of the country we need to do more which I'll be speaking to and I said I'm going to talk to the president about if he takes my call if that gets set up we need another package there's a lot of people that are going to be left behind there's a lot of holes we're gonna find as well intent of the legislation was that didn't get covered for example you have students out there with significant student debt they're now in three cycles they had nine of this this generation from this one that are 18 years old all the way the people are in their early 30s look what they've gone through they've gone through 9/11 they went through the economic downturn they went through what we're going through now and let's put them behind the eight-ball we can't make the same mistakes we know what we have to do we should be okay what are we gonna do to plan to make sure that the next virus the next viruses begin to prepare for it now or when this if this comes back if it rebounds so there's so much we have to do Social Security recipients should be getting another 200 to 300 dollars in their paychecks now and there's Social Security checks now they need the help now so there's a whole range of things that are fully within our capacity and we should be focusing on what we have to do about it now in my view and I think you're gonna find I predict you that no matter what Mitch says he's gonna be back handling other package the idea that they're gonna be this is the end of it I will I will be dumbfounded if that occurs and disappointed Thank You mr. vice president thank you great our next question comes from bill dinero from AP yes mr. vice president senator Sanders is kind of making a new push regardless of the gap between you two and delegates to try to bring the conversation back to medicare-for-all saying that this scenario proves the private sector proves the private sector can't meet this kind of demand can you can you restate why why is it that you are still coming at they're saying it's public option is the better model to get more people covering more people care if you had the medicare-for-all option now it still has to be implemented by the federal government look here's the point the idea that this would have stopped the virus from occurring the idea would have been able to be implemented earlier the idea would have fundamentally changed anything it's just not accurate and besides you got to pass what is a thirty five trillion dollar bill over the next ten years mildly complicating at the same time here and so what we should be doing is having the Affordable Care Act add the public option for those who want it meaning Medicare if they can fad if that's what they want rather than keep their own health insurance policies is if you notice it's not about whether or not the health insurance is available to people that that have private insurance it's not about that now it's about whether or not the government is going to be able to implement all the things that were supposed to be doing and so I don't see where Medicare for all would make any difference in terms of the speed with which and the recovery rate which would occur if in fact it existed do you have any concern that Bernie's push on this could could confuse the issue and then kind of take take people's eye off the ball as you see it no I don't look I think look senator Sanders is passionate about this he believes it to his every fiber in his being and I respect him for that I just disagree with him great the next question is from Jessica Dean from CNN hi mr. vice president thanks for taking my question happiness you mentioned your call potential call with President Trump and and I'm curious how close do you think you are to making that happen and and how confident are you that this could actually be a productive conversation that he would take any advice that he's open to also many of the plans that you've laid out well I just taking Kelly on Conway at her word she said the president why am I not suggesting what should be done I laid out a 19-point plan some of which was accepted some was rejected when I laid it out I said that I think those things that the president can use early on from the experience we had before and take a look at it and if he did I wasn't going to be out there saying he took my idea it's a matter of the president doing what can most effectively get things done now and so but I don't know all I know is that and the conversations in the past has been a long time I've had with them they've been they've been respectful they've been straightforward and I'm not doing this to criticize I'm doing this say this is what I think is you do for example on the defense production Act I would strongly recommend the president move beyond just ventilators beyond just ventilators he has the capacity to do that I think it would not be unusual to suggest maybe they're already thinking of doing it having one commander-in-chief one person in charge of making sure the allocation of all the equipment is needed for protective gear is under the control of one person so they all know where it's going just like if we're a war just like what happens in a war time and we've talked to the president says he's what wartime president this is a war against this virus there's a number of specific suggestions that that I I know from in the past work and and some I think would work and I'm prepared to offer them to the president I understand if he doesn't want to take my advice but it won't be I told you so mr. president it won't be if he decided to do what I suggest that I go back and say well I told the president do that this is beyond politics right now I mean the projections that I get in the morning when I speak to the docs that I work with are could be really dire we're talking about a lot of people potentially dying and we're now leading the world in in the number of cases and we've got to act more swiftly more rapidly and you know we've been through this in a slightly different way in the past and I hope they can learn some lessons from what we did right and maybe what we did wrong thank you thank you and the next question goes to Trevor Honeycutt from Reuters hi mr. vice president so my question is is about the Wisconsin primary and whether you think it's still appropriate to have in-person voting there considering the fact that the Democratic National Convention has been pushed back and and public health officials say it's important to stay on this well the answer is I listen to the scientist a convention having tens of thousands of people in one arena is very different than having people walk into a polling booth with accurate spacing to six to ten people feet apart one at a time going in and have machines scrub down but I do think our gonna be a lot more I think you could hold the election as well dealing with mail-in ballots and same-day registration I mean there's a lot of things that can be done that's for the Wisconsin courts and folks to decide but I think it's possible to do both to have both more mail-in ballots people and today is the last day again still 5 o'clock to ask for one was an hour time difference from where I am in Wisconsin and I think it could be done based on what I'm being hearing from the news what I understand the governor and others are saying but that's for them to decide thank you thank you thank you everyone for joining today we really appreciate it as always if you have any further questions please reach out to our press team and we will get back to you thank you again for your time thanks for taking the time everyone appreciate

administration to do the right thing and open up a new enrollment period for obamacare so that people who need insurance now can get PRON now be not the time for petty politic this be a national emergency PRON government should be do everything possible to protect people health and well being and the good news be the us government take important action last week pass the law a two trillion dollar care act PRON be the namesake of PRON know remarkable feat of bipartisanship that that nancy and schumer and i and the republican leader put together to just the real national crisis and democrats make sure provide reassurance and relief for american worker but now president trump have to make sure PRON be implement swiftly transparently and effectively yesterday the trump administration suggest that i should call the president offer to help well PRON be happy to hear PRON will take PRON call PRON team work with PRON to set such a call up and PRON have be offer PRON

i suggest PRON think be worthwhile and i would not be anything about except complement PRON for the job PRON be do today i make the same offer with regard to PRON new ten point make PRON work checklist PRON have do this work before i can tell PRON PRON take more than tweet and press conference PRON be hard PRON be painstaking work this be what leader have to lead and government have to work i be in charge of administer the eight hundred billion dollar recovery act so understand that the devil be in the detail PRON be about follow through the cares act provide more money tell people now how do PRON make sure PRON get to those people as quickly as possible and what those little red tape as possible know there be money to help keep small business afloat how do PRON make sure the small business get access to those fund so PRON can make rent and keep worker on the payroll there be money for large corporation how do PRON make sure that there be a rigorous oversight to ensure PRON be use to help worker not enrich top executive be well off investor those be the kind of question that the president should be ask now and PRON be responsible for that and frankly PRON do not have PRON do not have not have a great record so far when PRON come to the delivery real help to the american people in timely fashion i hope this time be different PRON may not like PRON but be president be about take responsibility the blame game can not cut PRON in this crisis too many life be at stake there have be too many there be this look PRON have to be clear with PRON objective and PRON timeline and the benchmark there should be one person responsible accountable for make sure thing be coordinate and do correctly there must be transparency at every step of the way PRON be release a full checklist on joe biden calm be PRON be just a starting point but let PRON offer a few highlight PRON need to get the unemployment insurance check out as quickly as possible and in full now that sound simple but state be already overwhelm by the million of claim PRON have never have this many at one time with more to come state need more staff to administer those office well technology more robust system to both accept claim and get fund out the door the white house the white house should have the back PRON state through the back of the state not just take PRON be the responsibility of the white house from the federal government to help look the promise of the cure act be that PRON average worker will be make financially whole even if PRON lose the job the president have to deliver on that promise PRON should immediately stand up a team with empower that be empower with a senior leadership to help state solve challenge that PRON inevitably be go to face distribute PRON unemployment benefit PRON know PRON should give PRON all the resource PRON need to increase the capacity to do that PRON should issue clear guidance about the broad possible eligibility to south include gig worker and those furloughed PRON be qualified as well so work americans understand that help that be available to PRON be available and how to get PRON and how to access PRON this be there be no time to lose this be go to be difficult but PRON have to happen now PRON have to make sure all small business for example get help fast so PRON can keep people on the payroll PRON know PRON do no good for congress to move quickly if the administration can not get the these loan to small business that be in need now for million of american worker payday be tomorrow tomorrow every single eligible small business need to be able to access the help access to help regardless of how small PRON be whether PRON be in the suburb be struggle in an urban community or in a small rural town woman own business minority own business the money should be go out the door as fast as possible not just to the well connect not just to a few splashy lea announce example look to all who qualify that be what have to be everybody who qualify as PRON be design the program depend on the willingness of the private bank to provide government back PRON be not PRON be not take the risk governor back in the loan government back loan and these small business but that be not be PRON strong point in the past that be why PRON be call for a bank defense production act authority to make sure that the wide range of bank be process loan for all those who qualify within a few work day of application PRON can turn qualified applicant that PRON can not turn qualified applicant away but PRON can determine who be qualified or put PRON at the back of the line PRON be also call for move the cap on this funding so that no eligible small business or nonprofit be leave behind look the governor be provide the guarantee now the bank have to step up and do PRON part i know PRON be go to be hard but PRON have to step up PRON also need to keep people on the payroll by use work share authority so the full extent of the law that be PRON have two worker PRON each go in half time that each entitle to be get unemployment so PRON be as if PRON be be pay full time the wife outage should expand the work share program to all state the district of columbia puerto rico the us virgin island these program help employer keep employer keep more worker employ with the federal government make up the difference in lose hour an additional $ for lay off worker and the care act should also be available to encourage work share to help keep worker employ every person every person on work sharing be another person still in a job this be go to take bold create a federal action in partnership with the state and PRON should get to work PRON need to get direct cash relief payment out to as many people as possible as quickly as possible again this may sound straightforward but no american should have to wait a single minute so donald trump can put PRON signature on a physical check PRON be not about PRON PRON be about family that need the cash now payment should be electronically make or via prepaid debit card and PRON should be go out the door now when PRON come to protect against waste and abuse either by corporation of this administration PRON can not take the cup off the beat donald trump have threaten to block the work of the special inspector general that congress create to oversee the billion dollar fund for corporation the idea of take that authority way be simply unacceptable as i say i oversee an eight hundred billion dollar program the big recovery ever pass before this one and PRON be hard work to make sure there be no less than two tenth of one percent fraud when PRON get all finish that be what PRON be less than two tenth of one percent fraud or abuse but PRON do PRON and PRON matter because every dollar waste do not get to a worker or a family who badly need PRON PRON know PRON can not let that happen the president have to give the expectant inspector general free rein and full transparency if PRON will not congress have to hold the president accountable in addition democrats want important oversight protection against the money be use for stock buyback or executive compensation but the administration can and should set the bar even higher PRON have lay out a number of condition to make sure company be not take the money and then turn around and fire worker outsource job finally start work on phase four PRON need another plan before this be over PRON have go through the first three phase PRON be try to implement phase three two and three now PRON can not wait though the tragedy of this crisis that be how much pain could have be avoid with swift decisive action PRON have already know PRON be go to need more resource a lot more more people be go to need to help PRON be go to gap be go to become apparent PRON be go to need to fix PRON and fill PRON some people be leave out of the care act PRON will need to help PRON as well america long term recovery be go to require far more investment but PRON need to be smart and effective so let PRON start now so PRON do not waste valuable time that be how this administration can make PRON work and make PRON work for all the american people not just big business and corporate executive family struggle to make rent worker be lay who PRON know have have PRON hour slash never lay off PRON frontline health care hero who can not wait for help and above all this administration still need to set up PRON response to the public health crisis include get hospital and health care funding in the care act out the door to the hospital and health care folk for time president be talk about this crisis be a choice between protect public health and reopen the economy that be a false and dangerous way to think about the problem the virus be why PRON be have and PRON be PRON have this economic crisis failure to rest the spread of the virus be the direct cause of economic pain americans be suffer today this instant some so PRON know nobody nobody there be none of PRON who will think this matter no amount of relief will help family ride out this and PRON can not break this infect of this infection curve and break PRON quickly to stop the spread of the virus and save american life that be priority number one so thank PRON all thank PRON all for take time to listen i know there be a lot i have not speak to but PRON be happy to try to take PRON question now thank PRON very much thank PRON sir PRON be now go to start take question people like to ask a question just remember to please raise PRON hand at the bottom of the screen the first question will go to andrea mitchell from nbc andrea PRON be PRON now PRON be youjin or honor thank PRON very much hello thank PRON but mr vice president PRON be see heartbreaking appeal from the frontline health worker all over the country especially in new york city which be the crux of the problem right now and the governor be tell PRON democratic and republican governor be say PRON still be not get supply still there be no one from fema who seem to be in charge can PRON say what PRON would tell the president if PRON do take PRON call about what need to be do to get this aid the protective gear the equipment PRON need to these hospital to or frontline health worker to be ems worker and secondly PRON be call for a fourth package but senator mcconnell have say PRON be not interested in a nancy pelosi tell PRON today PRON be already ready and work on PRON what would PRON say to the republican leadership and to the white house about the need for a fourth package well let PRON start at the front end PRON know i have a son in law ashley PRON husband be a surgeon up in philadelphia one of the big hospital and i talk to PRON every day with other health care provider and expert and PRON be tell about a friend of PRON up in new york who be say PRON just have two young man die on PRON table one be i think year old and i think a marathoner do not hold PRON that in great shape know there be year old this be only go to get bad PRON be not go to get well and there be a real sense of panic that be occur around the country and among some i will not say panic great concern among healthcare provider and first responder so number one PRON be in a situation where the president as i be come down to this makeshift studio i be tell by a staff member that the president say PRON be go to fully implement the defense production act now and so i say great and i state a second as well as a few minute later i say what have PRON say and i read the statement PRON be all about ventilator which be really important and should have be do four week ago but PRON should employ that defense production act for all the thing need glove mask face shield gown etc that should be be do yesterday last week a month ago get PRON do now and for example test PRON be in a situation where PRON have test that be not be distribute number one because there be no one person no commander and the white house or the administration like a military commander this determine distribution of what be available and PRON have to be in point PRON have to be use in the defense production act to get company who have the capacity to gather all the material need for the test assemble PRON and move now use PRON full authority this be a war act like a commander in chief use PRON all and so i PRON be a little worried that that have not be expand and PRON know the health care worker and i watch PRON interview and everyone else interview on tv and there be so many example of these i watch last night a young doctor say how friendly be the glenda theme room but PRON say PRON think about how soldier go in and so PRON why do not PRON have more courage PRON be go to do PRON but PRON be frightening to go in and dada people be really worried let PRON get on the job provide what be need PRON ask the third part of PRON question relate to whether or not what be the third part of PRON question actually PRON ask three piece all right would PRON be the question about whether or not a fourth package PRON be sorry yes yes the majority leader in the senate be say no well the majority of the senate be wrong and slow the first time around and PRON be wrong and slow this time around look PRON know morse have to happen there be no possibility that the monie that provide for to try to just get this under control be go to be enough to deal with the aftermath both economically and in term of the health of the country PRON need to do more which PRON will be speak to and i say PRON be go to talk to the president about if PRON take PRON call if that get set up PRON need another package there be a lot of people that be go to be leave behind there be a lot of hole PRON be go to find as well intent of the legislation be that do not get cover for example PRON have student out there with significant student debt PRON be now in three cycle PRON have nine of this this generation from this one that be year old all the way the people be in PRON early look what PRON have go through PRON have go through PRON go through the economic downturn PRON go through what PRON be go through now and let PRON put PRON behind the eight ball PRON can not make the same mistake PRON know what PRON have to do PRON should be okay what be PRON go to do to plan to make sure that the next virus the next virus begin to prepare for PRON now or when this if this come back if PRON rebound so there be so much PRON have to do social security recipient should be get another to dollar in PRON paycheck now and there be social security check now PRON need the help now so there be a whole range of thing that be fully within PRON capacity and PRON should be focus on what PRON have to do about PRON now in PRON view and i think PRON be go to find i predict PRON that no matter what mitch say PRON be go to be back handle other package the idea that PRON be go to be this be the end of PRON i will i will be dumbfound if that occur and disappointed thank PRON mr vice president thank PRON great PRON next question come from bill dinero from ap yes mr vice president senator sanders be kind of make a new push regardless of the gap between PRON two and delegate to try to bring the conversation back to medicare for all say that this scenario prove the private sector prove the private sector can not meet this kind of demand can PRON can PRON restate why why be PRON that PRON be still come at PRON be say PRON be public option be the well model to get more people cover more people care if PRON have the medicare for all option now PRON still have to be implement by the federal government look here be the point the idea that this would have stop the virus from occur the idea would have be able to be implement earlier the idea would have fundamentally change anything PRON be just not accurate and besides PRON get to pass what be a thirty five trillion dollar bill over the next ten year mildly complicate at the same time here and so what PRON should be do be have the affordable care act add the public option for those who want

where medicare for all would make any difference in term of the speed with which and the recovery rate which would occur if in fact PRON exist do PRON have any concern that bernie push on this could could confuse the issue and then kind of take take people eye off the ball as PRON see PRON no i do not look i think look senator sander be passionate about this PRON believe PRON to PRON every fiber

50,QfLPYh8a4nQ,biden,2020-06-02T16:10:27Z,Joe Biden remarks on Protests,speech,"mr. Mehra thanks for hospitality and to all they elected officials that are here I bring ingredients I can't breathe I can't breathe George Floyd's last words but they didn't die with him they're still being heard echoing all across this nation they speak to a nation we're too often just the color of your skin put your life at risk they speak to a nation where more than 100,000 people have lost their lives the virus and 40 million of file for unemployment with the disproportionate number of those deaths and job losses concentrated in black and brown communities and they speak to a nation where every day millions of people and millions not at the moment of losing their life but in the course of living their life are saying to themselves I can't breathe it's a wake-up call to our nation in my view it's for all of us and I mean all of us it's not the first time we've heard those words they're the same words we heard from Eric garner when his life was taken away six years ago but it's time to listen to those words to try to understand them to respond to them respond with action a country is crying out for leadership leadership the key unites leadership that brings us together leadership that can recognize pain and deep grief of communities that have had a knee on their neck for a long time there's no place for violence no place for looting or destroying property or burning churches or destroying businesses many of them built by the very people of color for the first time in their lives were beginning to realize their dreams and build wealth for their families nor is it acceptable for our police sworn to protect and serve all people to escalate tension resume to excessive violence we need to distinguish between legitimate peaceful protests and opportunities to violent destruction we have to be vigilant about the violence that's being done by this incumbent president to our economy and to the pursuit of justice when peaceful protesters dispersed in order for a president a president from the doorstep of the people's house the White House using tear gas and flash grenades in order to stage a photo-op a photo-op and one of the most historic churches in the country or at least in Washington DC we can be forgiven for believing the president's more interested in in power than in principle were just serving the passions of his base than the needs of the people in his care for that's what the presidency is the duty to care to care for all of us not just those who vote for us but all of us not just our donors but all of us the president held up the Bible at Saint John's Church yesterday I just wish he opened it once in a while instead of brandishing it if he opened it he could have learned something they're all called to love one another as we love ourselves it's really hard work but it's the work of America Donald Trump is interested in doing that work instead he's preening and sweeping away all the guardrails that law protected our democracy guardrails that have helped make possible this nation's path to a more perfect union a union that constantly requires reform and rededication and yes the protest from voices that are mistreated ignored left out or left behind but it is a union be worth fighting for and that's why I'm running for president in editions of the Bible the president might also want to open the US Constitution once in a while if he did he'd find a thing called the First Amendment and what it says and began it says the right of the people peaceably to assemble and to petition their government for redress of grievances that's kind of an essential notion built into this country mr. president that's America that's America no horses rising up on their hind legs to push back peaceful protest not using the American military to move against the American people this is a nation of values our freedom to speak is a cherished knowledge that lives inside every American almost from the time you're a kid we're not allow any president to quiet our voice we all let those who see this as an opportunity to sow chaos throw up a smokescreen to distract us and very real religious and legitimate grievances at the heart of these protests we can't we can't leave this moment I can't leave this moment thinking that we can once again turn away and do nothing I can't do that this time we just can the moment has come for our nation to deal with systemic racism to deal with the growing economic inequity that exists in our nation to deal with the denial of the promise of this nation made to so many you know I've said from the outset of this election that we're in the battle for the soul of this nation and we are in the battles of a soulless nation well we believe that maybe most importantly who we want to be it's all stake that's truer today than it has ever been at least in my lifetime and it's this urgency it's in this urgency we can find a path forward now the history of this nation teaches us that in some of our darkest moments of despair we've made some of our greatest progress some of our darkest moments the 13th 14th 15th amendments followed the Civil War the greatest economic growth in world history grew out of the Great Depression Civil Rights Act of 1964 and 65 OD Rights Act of 65 came and the tracks of bull Connor's vicious dogs to Pryor phrase Reverend barber it's the morning when we find hope it's in the morning when we find hope only more but it's going to take more than talk we've had talked before about a protest before we've got it now avow to make this at least an area of action and reverse the systemic racism with a long-overdue concrete changes the action will not be completed but in the first hundred days of my presidency if I'm fortunate enough to be elected or even to my entire term it's going to take the work of a generation but if this agenda will take time to complete it should not wait for the first hundred days of my presidency to get started a down payment on what does long overdue should come now should come immediately I call on the Congress to act this month on measures that would be the first step in this direction starting with real police reform congressman Jeffries has a bill to outlaw choke holes Congress should put it on the President's desk in the next few days there are other measures to stop transferring weapons of war to police forces improve oversight and accountability to create a model use of for standard that also should be made law this month no more excuses no delays if Mitch Connell can bring in the United States Senate to confirm Trump's unqualified judicial nominees who will run roughshod over our Constitution now it's time to pass legislation we'll give true meaning to our constitutional promise of equal protection under the law looking ahead in the first hundred days of my presidency I've committed to creating a national police oversight Commission I've long believed we need real community policing we need each and every Police Department of the country to understand a comprehensive review of the Undertaker conference review of their hiring their training through de-escalation some have already done it somehow are in the process of doing it the federal government should give give the cities and states the tools and the resources they need to implement reforms more police officers meet the higher standards of the procession most of them do it all the more reason why bad cops should be dealt with severely and swiftly we all need to take a hard look at the culture to allows for the senseless tragedies that keep happening and we need to learn from the cities and the precincts that are getting it right we know though we have in order to have true American justice we need economic justice as well here to is there's much to be done as a media step Congress should act should act now to rectify racial inequities that allow Cova 19 recovery funds to be diverted from where they live I'll be setting forth my genuine economic justice and opportunity in the weeks and months ahead but it begins with health care health care should be a right not a privilege the quickest route to universal coverage in this country is to expand on Obamacare we can do it we should do it but this president even now in the midst of a public health crisis with massive unemployment as well wants to destroy him he doesn't care how many millions Americans will be heard because he consumed with his blinding ego when it comes to Barack Obama president obama the presidency withdraw his lawsuit to strike down obamacare and the congress should prepare to pass the act i proposed to expand obamacare to millions more so everyone's covered these last few months we've seen America's true heroes health care workers Doc's nurses delivery truck drivers grocery store workers you know we've come up with a new phrase for them essential workers essential workers but we need to do more than praise them we need to pay them we need to pay them because they weren't clear before it's clear now this country wasn't built by Wall Street bankers and CEOs and was built by the great American middle class which is built by unions and our essential workers you know I know there's enormous fear and uncertainty and anger in the country I understand I know so many Americans are suffering suffering loss of a loved one suffering economic hardship wondering can I feed my family tomorrow what's going to happen suffer under the weight of a generation after generation after generation I've heard inflicted on people of color I'm black brown and Native communities in particularly like many of you I know what it means to grieve my losses are not the same as losses felt by so many but I know what it feels like when you think you can't go on I know what it means to have that black hole in your chest where your grief is being sucked into it just a few days ago mark the fifth anniversary of my son most passing cancer there's still moments and when the pain is so great it feels no different than the day that bed as he passed away but I also know that the best way to bear loss and pain is to turn it into that anger and anguish into purpose and Americans know what our purpose is as a nation it has to be guided has to be guided guided us from the very beginning notice was reported the day that President John F Kennedy was assassinated little Yolanda King came home from school in Toulon and jumped in her daddy's arms and said Oh daddy she said now we're never gonna get our freedom her daddy was reassuring strong and brave he said no don't worry baby it's gonna be okay it's gonna be all right amid the violence and fear dr. King he persevered he was driven by his dream of a nation where justice runs down like water and righteousness like a mighty stream then in 1968 hate cut him down in Memphis two days before dr. King was murdered he gave a final Sunday sermon to Washington everybody told us that though the arc of the moral universe is long he said it bends towards justice and we know we can bend it because we have we have to believe that still that's our purpose it's been our purpose in the very beginning to become a nation where all men and women are not only created equal but they're treated equally not just creating who would treat it equally to become a nation to find in dr. King's words not only by the absence of tension but by the presence of justice it's not enough just to not attention but justice today in America is hard to keep faith that justice is his hand I know that you know that the pain is raw the pain is real the president United States must be part of the solution not the problem but this president today is part of the problem and accelerates it when he tweeted the words when the looting starts the shooting starts they weren't the words of a president their words of a racist Miami police chief in the 60s when he tweeted that protesters quote would have been greeted with the most vicious dogs when people would have been really hurt end of quote they weren't the words of a president they were the kind of words Bull Connor would have used unleashing his dogs on innocent women and children you know the American story is a story about action and reaction that's actually works we can't be naive about it I wish I could say that hate began with Donald Trump and with him it didn't and it won't American history is in a fairy tale with a guaranteed happy ending the battle for the soul of this nation has been a constant push and pull for more than 240 years a tug of war between the American ideal that were all created equal in the harsh reality that racism has long torn us apart the honest truth is that both elements are part the American character both elements at our best the American ideal wins out but it's never a rout it's always a fight and the battle is never fully won but we can't ignore the truth that we're out our best when we open our hearts rather than clinch our fists Donald Trump has turned this country into a battlefield riven by old resentments and fresh fears he thinks division helps him his narcissism has become more important than the nation's well-being that he leads I ask every American I mean this in the bottom I'll ask every American look at where we are now and think anew is this who we are is this what we want to be is this if we want to pass on to our children and our grandchildren fear anger finger-pointing rather the pursuit of happiness incompetence and anxiety self-absorption selfishness or do we want to be the America we know we can be the America we know in our hearts we could be it should be look I look at the presidency as a very big job and nobody will get it right every time and I won't either but I promise you this I won't traffic in fear and division I won't fan the flames of hate I'll seek to heal the racial wounds that have long plagued our country not use them for political gain I'll do my job and I will take responsibility I won't blame others I'll never forget I will never forget I promise you this job is not about me it's about you it's about us and the work not only to rebuild the nation but build it better than it was we're the only nation of the world that goes through crisis and comes out better we to build a better future that's what a man does to build a better future we build the future it may in fact be the most American thing to do build the future we hunger for Liberty the way Harriet Tubman and Frederick Douglass did we thirst for the vote like susan b anthony and Ella Baker and John Lewis did we strive to explore the Stars cure disease make an imperfect Union more perfect than his been we make them up short but at our best we try my fellow Americans were facing a formidable enemies they include not only the coronavirus and the table impact from the lives and livelihoods but also the selfishness and fear that have loomed over our national life for the last three years and I choose those words advisedly selfishness and feared defeating those enemies requires us to do our duty and that Duty includes remembering who we should be who we should be we should be the America of FDR and Eisenhower of Rosa Parks and Martin Luther King jr. of Jonas Salk and Neil Armstrong we should be the America that cherishes life liberty and courage and above all we should be the American that chose to each other each and every one of us you know we're a nation in pain we must lot but our pain destroys our nation enraged we can't love our rage consume us we're a nation that's exhausted but we will not allow our exhaustion defeatist as president it's my commitment to all of you to lead on these issues and to listen because I truly believe in my heart of hearts we can't overcome we stand together finally as one America over eyes stronger than we were before we'll move that art closer to justice we'll reach out to one another so speak out for one another and please please do us recently been happening take care of one another this is the United States of America there's never been anything we've been unable to do when we set our mind to do it and we've done it together together United that's we are at our best may God bless you all may God protect our troops",b mr mehra thank for hospitality and to all PRON elect official

51,yy6jBRVDcpI,biden,2020-06-17T18:54:20Z,Vice President Biden Delivers Remarks On Having a Safer Economic Reopening,speech,">>Good afternoon,
everyone. I apologize for
the slight delay. We wanted to make
sure everyone was able to get here. Let me think the
local officials for joining today. I know they have
a lot to do. They have really been
very, very busy. Before I begin
my remarks, I want to acknowledge that it was five
years ago today when a white supremacist walked into Mother Emanuel church
in Charleston, South Carolina and slaughtered
a friend of mine and eight other
parishioners. It was hate unbridled. And it was poisonous. A poisonous expression of white supremacy that still affects our nation and
many of our institutions. Of the dangers
that we face as a society, if we don't root
out this corrosive and deadly ideology. You know, when I reflect back on the amazing
grace and compassion and forgiveness of the
Mother Emanuel community, I see the very best and what we see in America. As Americans. But we know that
grace alone is not enough. We have to put it to work,
that grace. And we are seeing
the best of America in that as well. In the weeks of
peaceful protest, civil actions taking place in
cities and towns of every size in this
state and every other state across the country. People are keeping their eyes focused on how much danger it
is to live a life of a black or a brown
skinned person in this country. Americans are out there marching,
notwithstanding the fact that we are
in the middle of a pandemic. That is how critical they think it is. On Monday, Donald Trump
said, ""If we stopped testing right now for COVID-19 we would have very
few cases, if any."" If we stopped
testing now, we would have very
few cases, if any. This statement is not only absurd, it is absolutely tragic. Yesterday, the head of
the White House task force on coronavirus,
the vice president, claim success in the
fight because deaths are ""Down to fewer
than 758 a."" 750 fathers and mothers, sisters and brothers,
uncles, aunts, husbands, wives, children dying every day and more than
20,000 a month. That is greater than
World War II level casualties each month. That is more than five 9/11 each month. And this administration is engaging in self congratulations It may be good enough
for Donald Trump, but it will never
ever be acceptable if I am your president. Researchers have shown that tens of thousands
of Americans have died needlessly because Donald Trump was slow to respond to the crisis. And then when he did, he bungled the response. Four weeks in January
and February I was raising
my concerns about how we need to
take this very seriously. All while it (Multiple Speakers) Was
ignoring and reporting from his own intelligence community in his daily briefings. The warnings of his
closest advisors all the while praising
the Chinese government for being transparent in handling this virus. Instead of demanding access for the CDC that Beijing
was refusing to give. The American people
have sacrificed so much. We have lost lives. We have lost businesses. We have lost paychecks. And now, thanks to
Donald Trump's bungling, we may lose some
of the progress we have begun to make. All because he has lost interest. He is once again
ignoring the facts. The public health
response is still woefully, woefully
lacking from this administration. More than 117,000 people have died in the United States
of America with an average
daily number of cases still climbing in 21 states. We still don't
have what we need when it comes to rapid results testing, contact tracing
capacity. Widely available personnel. Protective equipment for them. Or clear nationwide
guidance. Instead, President Trump pushes dangerous and disproven drugs and it stands in the
way of the CDC issuing guidelines on reopening. They had them, wanted
to issue them, and he wouldn't
let them. He refuses to
wear a mask. Failing those basic tests
of leadership. He scaled back meetings
of the COVID-19 task force. I guess there
is not much to do. In spite of experts
saying that testing and tracing is necessary for reopening, he sent his testing
is our home. With money provided
to the Pentagon for essential medical
supplies, only 15%, only 15% has made it
out the door. Donald Trump wants to style himself
as a wartime president against this invisible
enemy, the coronavirus. Unlike any other war, any other wartime
leader, he takes no responsibility. He exercises no leadership. Now he just is flat surrendering
the fight. Instead of leading the charge to defeat the virus he just basically waved a white flag and
has retreated. He is so eager to get back to his campaign rallies. He will put people at
risk, as everyone has pointed out, in violation of the
CDC guidelines. Which still
warns against large gatherings He is ready to do it as long as the people showing up sign a waiver promising they will not hold
the campaign liable. Donald Trump's failure to fight the coronavirus with the same
energy and focus that he uses to troll his enemies
on Twitter has cost us lives. It is putting hope for
an economic recovery at risk. Job numbers and
retail sales were better
than expected in May. That is great news for the country. But now Donald
Trump's desire to declare victory and be done with it is only going to peril the continued
progress we have to make. Our economy is still sputtering with more than 20 million people
unemployed. And no clear guidance from the federal
government for what businesses
need to do to reopen safety, efficiently and generate a
strong recovery. This isn't a debate about whether to reopen. It is about how
we make reopening work for everyone. The employees at the White House, they get daily
COVID-19 test. They know they are safe before they go to work. And they know their
coworkers are safe. They have the confidence to resume their lives. Workers across
the country aren't asking for
daily testing. They are just asking for
regular and reliable access to tests. Don't they deserve that? So it is not that Donald Trump doesn't
recognize the importance of testing. It is that he is not up to the task or doesn't care. And now he is seemingly deciding he doesn't even want to try. But just like
he couldn't wish COVID-19 away in March, just like he couldn't tweak it away in April, he can't ignore it away in June. So I have some basic questions for President
Donald Trump. What are you going to do to make sure
every worker has access to
regular testing so they have the same confidence to go into a store or go back to work that White House
staffers have? Why leaving schools
and childcare centers to navigate the uncertainty all on their own without ineffective guidance
and resources that they need
to protect the kids and their
communities? Why don't you enforce the OSHA standards for worker protection during this global
pandemic? Why is it that the
mainstream lending program created more than two months ago
by the Congress to help struggling small
businesses only open for
registration to lenders two to get -- days ago and still hasn't
distributed a single penny? Why don't you just close the names, Mr
President, of the businesses that received a total
of $500 billion of taxpayer funding? Why are they
being hidden? How many cronies got bailouts? How many donors? How many big businesses that didn't need it? What business
had to shut down because they were denied funding in April? What businesses didn't get special approval? That others got a nod from the top. Why did you get rid of the watchdog,
Mr President? Why did you get rid of the watchdog? The watchdog appointed
to oversee every dollar distributed and Inspector General. Why did you get rid of that person? What are you
trying to hide? Too bad management on top of bad planning on top of neglect. It is totally unacceptable for a great nation
like ours. Folks, here's the truth. The pandemic
is still here. It is going to be here for the foreseeable
future. Until we get it
under control or until we have safe and proven
widely available vaccine. COVID-19 is a fact of nature. We have to deal
with this virus. And everything that
comes with it. We have to deal
with it head on and honestly. Talk -- tell the people
the truth. Franklin Roosevelt
during the depression, the American people can handle anything. Just tell them
the truth. Can't deal with it. The only way to deal
with that, Mr President, is if we put in the work investing and building
a dynamic, resilient economy and health system capable of getting and then
staying ahead of new outbreaks. We have the capacity
and the resources to do that. I have laid out
baseline steps about what needed to be done from make it work checklists for successful
accountable recovery that I put out back
in early April and the steps were a strong reopening that I released last week. It is not rocket
science. Granted, I have
incredible scientists advising me on almost a daily basis
about how to proceed, but it is not
rocket science. It is common sense. It is straightforward. That is why this is
perhaps the greatest indictment of Donald Trump's
complete and compelling lack
of leadership. He wasted months
and months and months passing the buck. Blaming everybody else and refusing to act when
he should have been preparing our country for long-term response and building up a resiliency to respond to
future flareups. Yet we still don't
have a comprehensive system for collecting COVID-19 case data. These are the basics. He should have
been preparing us to whether the valleys
and peaks of this virus. You should have been
working to shore up the vulnerabilities in our healthcare system that have been laid
bare in this crisis that he is trying
to eliminate in court. He should have
been working to bridge the inequities and strengthen the cracks in
the foundation. Our economic system
exposed for everyone to see. He hasn't done any of it. Because of the depths of
Donald Trump's failure, this pandemic
will continue to be worse for all Americans and much worse for black and
brown Americans. Folks in communities like Darby Borough Donald Trump thinks that
if he puts his head in the sand the American
people well too. It doesn't work
that way. Not one hundreds
of people are still dying every
day and millions are unemployed wondering how in God's
name they're going to keep the lights on and
food on the table. Not one workers are weighted down with worries about their safety
or what happens if they get sick. There are the steps we
need to be taking out to steer us strongly in
the right direction. To make a more
resilient future First, we have to do
everything we can to avoid deadly spikes
in the infections as people begin
to go back out into the world. We are not that much
better prepared today for the run of cases that over files are intensive care units then we were three
months ago. Second, we have to help give people the insurance and precautions that are necessary to restart the economy with
confidence. If Americans lose what little faith
they have left in the government's
ability to manage this pandemic we will see much deeper and longer lasting
economic impacts with even greater
repercussions for people's well-being. Mr President, don't leave the
American people to face this threat
on their own. With no guidance, resources or leadership. Don't let support
from the CARES Act expire next month while people are
still hurting. Don't leave our
front-line workers exposed without the resources they need and don't
waste anymore of our time,
Mr President. The American people need confidence
of clear guidance. Grounded in science that
is going to allow them to resume their
daily lives. American businesses need the support of
the federal government to continue to backstop them through the phases
of reopening. Workers need assurances that their health is your first concern. Americans need
a president who will put the
American people first, not his or her own ego. America needs
a president who will do the work I am ready on day
one after more than three years in office, why isn't Donald Trump ready? Mr President, wake up. Get to work. There is so much more to be done. Thank you.

56,ZcR_kuCJvD8,biden,2020-06-30T18:07:35Z,Vice President Biden delivers remarks on Trump’s failure to protect the American people,speech,"Numbers do not lie. Infection rates are going
up and more states than they are going down. Or than 125,000 people
in the United States have lost their lives
and to those numbers and new infections
continue to grow and once again this confronting this simple
fact that we will not be able to solve the
economic crisis without a rigorous public
health approach. They are not separable. Despite the
administration propaganda that their
response should be a cause for celebration
despite President Trump's request that we should slow down testing but
COVID-19 is still here and of the daily threat
to the American health and prosperity
is continuing. It didn't have
to be this way month after month as
other leaders and other tech -- other countries took
the necessary steps, Donald Trump failed us. Month after month as many
of us are urged to him to step up and do
his job, he failed us. Just look at the record. In January I along with
others sounded the alarm of the coronavirus
outbreak. Trump told the country
that COVID-19 is ""totally under control "" and everything will "" work out well"" and in
February I warned about the information
that we needed from the Chinese
government. I said the president
should demand she produced
the evidence. Trump said, "" we are in great shape. China's president said it was doing very well. In March I set forth a
detailed plan for 500 testing sites as well as
guaranteed emergency paid leave. Later that month I
called for full and immediate use of the
Defense production act. Critical for the delivery
of supplies that were basically needed. Trump accused healthcare
workers of stealing masks and
that's what he said. That they are stealing
the masks and that's well -- why we do
not have them. In April I released a
plan to secure the supply chain for PPE. Surge relation -- surge nationwide
testing Anna launched a nationwide health Corps
to focus on contact tracing. Trumps suggestions? Americans should inject disinfected into their bodies. In May, I condemned the
false choice between preserving public health
and our economy are administration. Testing
that would sustain our economic recovery. Trumps response, he
pushed for reopening without regard to safety
and called testing ""frankly overrated"" and this month I
outlined the path to reopen our country safely
and sustainably. It provided workers
small businesses, state and local governments the
tools and resources and guidance that they would
need and trumps proposal? He set a cutoff date
for federal funding in several states and
actually went to court to take away healthcare
for 22 million people by trying to get rid
of Obama care. And now, Donald Trump
is in retreat and remember, back in
March when I called and he called and we
talked about the needs and act like we were at
war with the virus. He caught him sigh -- his self a wartime president. Remember when he
sacrificed together and ""in the face of this
inevitable and invisible enemy. What happened? Now it's almost July. It seems like
our wartime presidents surrendered. Waved the white flag and
left the battlefield. Today we are facing
a serious threat and we have to meet it. We have to meet
it as one country. But the president
gives no direction. And he pits us against
one another. We cannot continue
like this. Half recovery and
half getting worse. We cannot continue. Half wearing masks and half rejecting
science. We cannot continue. Half with a plan and half just hoping
for the best and we will not
defeat this virus with a piecemeal
approach. Lifting restrictions
prematurely. Decreasing the
volatility of the crisis. Raising the likelihood of needing to reimpose
restrictions. Until our science
catches up to reality, until we have better
treatment for those become infected with widely available
vaccines we have to continue to do all we can
as the people and the government to keep our
fellow Americans safe and healthy. Today I'm releasing
a plan with the steps I believe
Donald Trump should have undertaken
immediately to build on the roadmap I released back in March
that would have saved the lives is had
been adopted. It's a plan to save
lives in the months ahead. Once again, I encourage him to
adopted this plan in its entirety. This is too important
for Paul to us. First testing,
testing, testing. More testing is not only
how you find more cases of coronavirus, it's how you stop the
coronavirus cases. Testing followed by rigorous contact
tracing. Quarantine and isolation
protocols. For those who have
been exposed. People aren't waiting
in lines for miles and miles long in
baking hot cars for drive-through nasal swabs for
the fun of it? They are doing it so
they can protect themselves but they know
when they have this mass: they are protecting
others. They are predicting
others. We know were not where we
need to be in testing. There are still
all hospitals and nursing homes that
do not have access to what they need. Testing is how we see
was happening in communities all across
the country. It's our eyes
on the ground. Without text -- that testing we
are flying blind. That's why it's
important to have reliable testing to everyone everywhere. That includes doubling
the number of drive-through testing
sites and keeping with increasing them until
there is no more lies. Michael no more lines. Every worker that gets called back to
their job can have the confidence that they and
their fellow workers are not infected. Experts agree that we
need more contact tracers. To track the path
of this virus and individuals studies like New York and California are
hiring thousands of tracers. Including 100,000
federally funded employees to do
contact tracing. Second, every single
front-line worker should have the personal
protective equipment that they need
to be safe. Five months into
this crisis and our healthcare workers are still forced
to scrambled and have to reuse these masks. Hundreds. Hundreds of healthcare
workers have died from COVID-19. Tens of thousands have
become infected. It should be zero. On both counts for these
healthcare workers if they have the right
equipment. How are we still not
having what we need? That's why we have a
Defense production act. Mr President, use
your authority. Use it this week. Scale up the production of
M 95 masks. The steps you have taken
so far haven't gotten the job done is
to president. Fix the shortage of PPE
before you tee off another round of golf. We can't just look at
where we are today. Were going to need these for the
foreseeable future. We know more is coming. Thirdly, we should be
laser focused on treatments
and vaccines. We should be leading a coordinated global
approach on the science. Not disregarding experts
while pushing dangerous and disproven drugs as if
they are treatments. There has been some progress but the
administration has not been transparent about
how they plan to manufacture enough
doses to make sure there is equitable distribution to scale. I hope they are
doing it now. They should be providing
$250 million to have a plan now exactly how they
will distribute the so every American has access
when and if the vaccine is available. They might be doing
it but we have no transparency. Let us see, Mr President. The White House should
report weekly on this progress. We cannot end up in the
same scratching and distributional problems that we had in testing. We need to make sure that customers are not
being gouged by new drug therapies and prices. When they are developed. We have to restore our
relationship with the World Health
Organization. For all of its
shortcomings and missteps around COVID-19. This is why WHO
was created. It's essential to
coordinating a global response during
up intimate. And of the United States
should be leading that response as we have
in the past. COVID-19 will
likely worsen. At the outset of flu
season this year. We have to put in
place measures now to ensure the seasonal flu vaccine
can be ready, available and administered safely
to those who need it under social distancing
guidelines especially for seniors. Fourthly, we need real plans. Real guidelines. With uniform nationwide
standards. To help us chart our
economic reopening. Whatever we have been
doing now is not working. The state-by-state
approach will only produce confusion and slow any progress. You all reported the CDC tried to clear guidelines
about what stages of reopening should
look like. The administration
delayed and scaled-back those plans. We need clear evidence based steps that states can adopt now. But the standard that must be met in
order to further proceed and the very imposition
of social distancing rules when cases
begin to arise. This is not rocket
science. We need to support
schools and childcare program so parents if and when they can
return to are confident that their children will
be safe and cared for. We should be holding and
providing stickers that say, safe for shoppers. A certification that stores are minimizing
their customers risk for exposure. We need to clear message
from the top of our federal government that
everyone needs to wear a mask in public. Wear a mask. It's not just about you. It's about your family. It's about your neighbors. It's about your
colleagues. It's about keeping
other people safe. It helps you, yes but
it's about keeping other people safe. It's a simple measure. It's also one of the
most effective ways that we can do the
right thing. It may be inconvenient,
it may be uncomfortable, but it's the right thing
to do as an American. Protect your coworkers
and neighbors. Finally, we need to
protect the population most at risk,
our seniors. Our black and brown
populations, native communities that are being
hit the hardest. Vulnerable populations
with pre-existing conditions. This continued growth is
causing a lot of fear and anxiety. Especially older
Americans and those with loved ones in
nursing homes I get calls all the time and they are
simply scared. They are frightened. This is taking a toll
on the physical health but it's an emotional
cost as well. We can expect of
vulnerable populations to quarantine
indefinitely without support and I want them to know that their health
and safety will be my responsibility. If I am your president. And I will not
abandon you. These are five fairly
straightforward steps that are going to help
defeat this pandemic. If you suspect a lot of
the steps are the same sort of things, I
was talking about in March when I released
my first response, you would be right. It feels like you are
hearing the experts talk about the same issues for
months and he would be right. These have always been
the steps that the government needed to put
in place to meet the threat. Statewide lockdowns,
and so many Americans lived under this for
months were intended to buy us time to get
our act together rather than preparing ourselves,
Donner Nemec Donald -- Donald Trump
squandered in. Here we are, we are
better to prepared -- we are not better
prepared than we were in March. Infections are
on the rise. The threat of
massive strikes against our healthcare
systems is on the horizon. Americans anxious and
out of work or fearful for their lives
and livelihoods. Donald Trump is doing
next to nothing about it. Mr President, the crisis is real. And it is surging,
Mr President. Your promises and
predictions and wishful thinking pulled
out of thin air are not only doing
the country no good, may sing -- making them lose
more faith in their government. America knows
this crisis is not behind us
even if you don't. They see what's happening even
if you refreeze too. They know that we need
a coordinated national plan and need it now even
though you don't, Mr President. And will not do it. You called yourself
a cheerleader. We don't need a
cheerleader Mr President we need a president
Mr President. A president who will
level with the American people. That will tell us the
unvarnished truth. A president who will
take responsibility instead of always
blaming others. A president that will
listen to the experts. Follow the science. Allow them to speak. A president who leads that will be an example
for the nation. Wear a mask. Keep your distance. Limit the size
of crowds. Mr President this
is not about you. It's about the health
and well-being of the American public. The American people don't make enormous
sacrifices over the past four months so
they can waste their time. And you can waste
all the efforts they have undertaken. With your midnight
train bids and tweets. You can . They did not do it so that you could wash
your hands and walk away from this responsibility. Maybe there are times
this nation needs a true leader. Now is not one of them. -- A cheerleader. Now is not one of them. America needs
a president. We cannot know today
with the state of the COVID-19 pandemic will
be next January. But I'm almost
certain, I hope I turn out to be wrong, I am almost certain
it will not be over. If I should have the
honor of being elected president on the day I'm sworn in I will get right to
work implementing all aspects and responses that
remain undone. I will have more today
about my day one COVID-19 agenda in
the weeks to come. My response will begin
well before I take the oath of office. I will start as soon as
the election is decided. I will be a president
that respects sciences. Who will not censor their ability to talk directly to the
American people. I will have, from day
one, the best medical experts and scientists for responses, you know Mike I will listen
to them and let them speak freely. I will look with the
governors from every state territory. We are all in
this together. We have to fight
this together. We will emerge from this
stronger because we did it together. May God bless you
all and may God protect our troops and I'm happy
to take questions if you have any. They gave me a list
of how to recognize. Is Alex out there? I can't tell
with the mask. >> We reported yesterday
that President Trump was briefed as early as March
2019 that Russia had ordered or offered
counties for the killing of US soldiers. You called his inaction a trail. Broadly, what
consequences do you think the president
should face for that and specifically what you
think Congress should do? >> First of all, Congress
and the intelligence committees should demand
of the facts. This seems to be a moving story and as
I was leaving I had the television on
and I understand there is even more
information that has come out today about
what was known. One of two things. This president talks about cognitive capability. He doesn't seem to know
what's going on. He either reads or gets
briefed on important issues and forgets
it or he doesn't think it's necessary
that he need to know it. But the fact is,
at a minimum the discrepancy
allegedly between the intelligence
community as reported, some thought it was more
certain and others thought it was less. That should be resolved. The president should
have said, I want you to come before me in the situation room
and lay out the differences and
discretion. Who is saying what? Let's get to the
bottom of this. Number two, it's clear to me that and I don't know if he
did, he should have immediately contacted our joints Chief of Staff and asked
what we are doing to prevent this. What are we doing to
prepare to deal with this if this
is happening? How are we doing this? What are we doing? Thirdly, he should have
picked up the finding that said, Vladimir if any of
this is true, and it doesn't cease to me
then you have a big problem. And make it clear. Get to the bottom
of this! It appears . And I do not have access to
classified information anymore. If what I have heard
over the last weekend of the recent reporting that it was in the
presidential daily brief, this is something
that I read every single day as vice president. The president read
it every day. I was briefed
every morning before I got to the
White House and then again. The idea that somehow he
didn't know or isn't being briefed is bad duty. The best way for
me to end this, I was talking to my wife and I don't see her get
outraged very often but she started asking,
what would you have done? If Bo was still
in harm's way? This information
came out and of the president.
Bo is my son . I'm sorry, I apologize. He served in Iraq
for a year. What are those parents
thinking out there? What are those sons and
daughters, husbands and wives. It's a dereliction
of duty. If any of this is
even remotely true. I think the
president has a lot to answer
for and we should get the
answers quickly. >> If these allegations
are true and he did nothing, then
in fact I think the public should.
Unrelated to my running that this man is not fit
to be president of the United States
of America. I was told NBC. Mike? >> A lot of us saw you
on the campaign trail you're still locked
in a very difficult nomination battle. The polls show you with a sizable
national lead. I wonder where you think the race stands at this
moment and what keeps you up at night as you
look ahead and if you can maintain this
advantage without campaigning in a
traditional way especially this fall when
voters begin to tune in? >> This is the most
unusual campaign in modern history. But I start off with
the present this that I'm going to follow
the docs orders. Not just for me but
for the country. That means that I'm not
going to be holding rallies. You all are here but the school has put the circle around. Everyone has their
masks on. I have gone
to you stated and Pennsylvania and I have traveled
about when I do I get in, make my case
and leave but you know me, I would
much rather be out there with people because
that's where I get the greatest
feel. I can get a sense of the look in their eyes
and the plane of voices that they have of what
they are concerned about. But notwithstanding that
I have been surprised into the ion areas as
we probably reach more people directly
with one on one. Particularly those of
you that are with the television stations, you
all know that when you are on, you're having a
one-to-one conversation with someone out there because there is one
person looking at you. I've never thought
of it before. They tell me 200 million
people have watched what I have done from home and of the half a dozen
things we have gone out and done. I think were probably
communicating directly in detail with
more people than we would
have otherwise. I would much rather
be doing it in person. So far, it remains to
be seen I don't want to jinx myself and I know
the polling data is very good but I think
it's a very early. It's much too early
to make any judgment. We have a lot more work
to do and I plan on laying out in detail why
economic plans as to how we recover from this. We are working it out
in detail on what I'm going to do if I am
elected president. A don't know if that
answers your question. >> Have you requested
a classified briefing as you would
entitled to be? >> They have not and as this proceeds I
may very well do that. I've been talking to.
I have a significant foreign policy staff
as you know that does those jobs. I had a lot of meetings with my former secretaries
of State and got into what they
have heard so far. But if it doesn't get
cleared up quickly then I will seek and ask
if I can be briefed. >> Have you begun to
prepare for debates? >> I can hardly wait. >> Over the weekend
Princeton decided to remove Woodrow Wilson's
name from their school and buildings due to
his racist thinking. President Trump
called that incredible stupidity
yesterday. What you think about the decision and the
president comments and more broadly as the
nation is in this moment of reckoning we see the removal of
statues and names from institutions and schools. Do you think this is the
right approach to come to terms with our nations
history and its leaders? >> I think there are
three categories. Any institution that
chose the name and now wants to get rid of that name, that's their
decision to make. I'm assuming the board
of trustees made the judgment about the
word rural -- of the Woodrow Wilson school. That was the institution
that chose the name and now no longer must be
associated with it. I think the president.
Secondly, I think there's a distinction
between the former mayor of
New Orleans said, a difference between reminders and
remembrances of history and recovering from history. The idea of comparing
whether or not George Washington
owned slaves or Thomas Jefferson owned
slaves, and someone who was in rebellion committing
treason and trying to take down a
union to keep slavery. There is a distinction. I think the idea of
bringing down. All of those Confederate
monuments through Confederate soldiers and
generals who strongly supported secession
and maintained slavery and going to war
to do it, those statues along in museums. With regard to those
statues that are in monuments like the Jefferson Memorial,
I think there's an obligation that the government
protect those monuments because they
are different at some point, it's a remembrance, it's not
revering someone who had that view. They might have things
in their past that are now and then distasteful
but that's a judgment. For example, taking down the Christopher Columbus
statue George Washington or etc., I
think that something that the government has
an opportunity and responsibility to protect
from happening. >> On a different subject
you have been doing these public events for
the past month which has put you in contact
with more people. Have you been tested for
coronavirus and if so, how frequently are
you doing that? >> I have not been tested
for the coronavirus for two reasons. One, I have had no
symptoms as my mother would say, knock on wood,
and number two, I haven't wanted to take
anyone else's place in the process. But the Secret Service
all get tested. They are around my home
and anyone who comes into my home including
staff is tested. To determine whether
they have the virus. I expect what I'm going
to do so doesn't look like I'm moving in the front of
the line here is be tested relatively soon. My daughter has been
tested and was in Florida and she's a social
worker working with boys and girls club. Before she could come
home she has been tested twice. To make sure that she is
clear and quarantined she lives in
Philadelphia. But I have not yet. I have not been
tested yet. >> I have to make sure
that I get the Wilmington newspaper here
before I leave or I will be dead. >> Thank you Mr
Vice President. We hope that you do this
through November as often as possible. >> I, the more I have
an opportunity I will. >> Yesterday you said at
a fundraiser regarding that you will confront potent, and makes
clear that he will have a price to
pay in interference in our democratic processes. Specifically, what would
you do to put in? If this is true and in
general for what is happened in the past? >> I can but I will not,
but I will tell him. The idea that Putin or
any other foreign leader can engage in attempting
to manipulate a presidential election,
the idea that he continues his activities in Central and Eastern
Europe that he's doing. The idea that it can
be done without any consequences is not going to happen
if I am president in my administration. That's everything from
making sure that we go to the United State --
the United Nations Security Council all
the way to imposing sanctions that would
commence with the action that he has taken
that has been before that and I had a
very blind conversations and I think he doesn't want me to
be present because he knows that we will have
more blunt conversations. >> Another issue, the
president says he's going to have an updated
list of potential nominees to the court. You have said you would
put a black woman on the court should a spot open
up but there are groups calling for you to put some specific
names on the court. >> I hate to follow
anything the president dies because he usually
does it all wrong. We are putting together
a list of group of African-American women
that are qualified and have the experience
to be in the court. I'm not going
to release that until we go further down
the line of setting them. Just like logical
questions about vice president. I'm not releasing the
names of all the vice presidential potential
nominees and there are number
of women of color. There are Latino women,
there are Asian there are across-the-board and
we are just underway now in the hard event
of going into the deep background checks to
take anywhere from 6 . 8 weeks and early August will be the target. >> This is a two-part
question just to follow up again on Russia. Do you believe that if
those reports are true that Trump is guilty of
violating his oath of office? On your VP choice, you
have said that you want your running mate to be
ready on day one to do the job. Do you think that someone
who does not have national security or
foreign policy can be ready on day one? >> One of the things you
try to do, I have talked in length over the years
with President Obama about this. You try to find
people who have a background and
expertise that you may not have. One of the reasons
President Obama picks me was because I
had considerable experience and getting
things done in Congress and secondly, I had
experience in foreign policy. Although he had clear
views of what he wanted to do and his strategy was in
terms of Americans he was looking for
someone who had day-to-day experience and
knew a lot of the world leaders. Although that's a
helpful thing to have it's not necessary
because I start off with the two places
I still have expertise are in both of those
places and uniting the country in Congress
and foreign policy. It almost all of the women
I'm considering have had some exposure to foreign policy
and national defense issues. But that's not a minimum
requirement. The requirement is that they have the
intellectual capacity as well as the temperament
as well as the leadership qualities
that landed everyone to believe that
they way to be ready on day one to be
president of the United States of America. With regard to whether
or not the president. It depends on exactly what
he did and what he knew but at a minimum, he either doesn't
understand his job and is having difficulties
sitting down and reading a report because a lot
of them, cross that he says he didn't read it
or see or know it. I don't know he
cannot read or no so many different things
that have come up over the last three years. But it is clearly a
dereliction of duty and it is clearly something that I think everyone
including my Republican friends
and opponents in the house and Senate are
worried about as well. Where's the Wilmington . The Delaware
news channel? That's my hometown team. >> Like other states Delaware
is seeing an increase in COVID-19 cases. You have a message for state and local
governments of how they have handled it so far
and how they need to handle it going forward? >> I think they have
handled it so far very well but you see
the governor make some adjustments
because there has been an uptake. It was one of the
states. I get briefed every day by a group of leading doctors
around of the country. Every day I get a print
out and have it in the book of the
states that are doing better and doing worse. Up until now there has
been a decline and now it's opening
up slightly. I have not spoken to the
governor today but my guess is, that he is going to be
looking very closely at what happens on the Delray Beach is
and how that occurred and restaurants and bars. I don't know enough
to know that. The good news is,
it has find out. Bad news, there's
a slight uptick. I have not gone
into the detail so I don't have any
advice because I don't know where it's
popping up. >> I'm going to
get in trouble. I know, tell them I will
be late just a little bit. >> I always get in
trouble on the last question. >> The response to this
pandemic has become very politicized even wearing
a mask has become political. If elected, how will you
get Americans on the same page? Can your plan be
successful if they are not? >> I'm going to try
to say this politely. The way to get on the
same page is to lower the rhetoric based
on division. Stop appealing to the less healthy
side of society. Instead of when a
golf cart goes by yelling white supremacy
and the president tweets it out, don't do things
like that. Bring the country
together. We are giving a portion
of the population who has responded to the a free pass and it
generates division. We are also talking in
terms of the president talking about manhood
and being strong. And not needing
the mass. We have to start
appealing to the better side of human
nature by pointing out that the mask is not so
much to protect me. It's if I have
an undiagnosed condition, it's protect
you against me. Is to protect
other people. It's called patriotism
and responsibility. It's called making sure
that you look out for the other person. We have spent
too much time and if you notice the
president puts everything in
terms of him. I'm not being facetious. Everything is him. It's I don't think
or I don't take responsibility or I did
not do that or I believe that. It's not about
I, it's about us. I think changing
the tone of the administration
across the board allowing scientists
to speak making sure that people
understand the facts, good bad and ended
different. And when a mistake is
made you say you make a mistake. You are wrong, they you
shouldn't have done it that way. I think all of those
things change the atmosphere. I'm apologize, you have
heard me say this before, the words of
the president matter. No matter who the
president is. No matter how
responsible or irresponsible the
president is. Whomever he or she is,
president can take us to war or bring peace. Can have markets
rise or fall. Appeal to the senior
side of humanity or our better angels. It matters, it
really matters. I think it's
about the tone. I think it goes
across the board. I know that I
was criticized legitimately during
the primary. By saying that I planned
on United and the country. We have to do that. If we cannot do that
we cannot function. We have to bring the
country together. On this piece, if
in fact we stand up. By the way, don't
hold me to numbers. You can correct me. I think something like
7475% of the American people enqueue should
wear a mask. I think we should
be talking to our better angels
and making feel indirectly guilty
for not doing the right thing. Appeal to the
better nature. I know that sounds
almost idealistic but it's not. Remind people. You don't wear this
mask, you end up hurting someone or you get infected. You take them
to your child. You could take it home
to your mother, father, husband, wife, you have a moral
obligation because it really is. I really do have to go. I'm going to get
in real trouble. Thank you. Go ahead.
I'm sorry. >> I'm a little confused
about the delineation of the destruction
of monuments. Americans -- are Confederate monuments worthy of preservation? Without the vote of local
elected officials? >> I think it's a
very different pain is better if they
are taken down like they took
the Confederate flag off of the
Mississippi. But I can understand
his anger and anguish that people feel by having for years
and years been under the statute the statue of
Robert E Lee. It's always better
to do it peaceful. There's a distinction
between those monuments. I shift responsibility
and I'm not . I think the elected
officials have a responsibility to move. Put them in museums. Get them down. But don't expect
if you have sitting in front of you
after all these years and we are finally going
through another phase of may be responding to the
systemic racism in America. And what we have
seen happen. Don't be surprised if
someone pulls down the statue of Jefferson
Davis. It's better that they
do not but it's fundamentally different than pulling down the
statue or going to the Lincoln Memorial
and trying to pull . Not the Lincoln
Memorial. That's a bad example. The Jefferson Memorial. >> Will you commit
to three debates? >> Yes! I'm committed
to following the national
debate group that sets up these
debates, who they pick as the moderators,
three of them. It has been this way
for a long time. The first one is a
one-on-one debate with the moderator into the
next one is led by the town meeting setting and
the third one is a normal debate. I commit to those. I'm looking forward
to those. Some speculate
that you are at some degree of
cognitive decline. You have 12 years
on me, sir. Have you been tested
for some degree of cognitive decline? >> I have been tested and look, all I have to
do is watch me and I can hardly wait to compare
my cognitive capability to the cognitive
capability of the man I'm running against

nthat president trump be brief as early as march n that russia have order or offered ncountie for the killing of us soldier PRON call PRON inaction a trail broadly what nconsequence do PRON think the president nshould face for that and specifically what you nthink congress should do first of all congress nand the intelligence committee should demand nof the fact this seem to be a move story and as ni be leave i have the television on nand i understand there be even more ninformation that have come out today about nwhat be know one of two thing this president talk about cognitive capability PRON doesn t seem to know nwhat be go on PRON either read or gets nbriefe on important issue and forgets nit or PRON doesn t think it necessary nthat PRON need to know PRON but the fact is nat a minimum the discrepancy nallegedly between the intelligence ncommunity as report some think PRON be more ncertain and other think PRON be less that should be resolve the president should nhave say i want PRON to come before PRON in the situation room nand lie out the difference and ndiscretion who be say what let get to the nbottom of this number two it be clear to PRON that and i don t know if he ndid PRON should have immediately contact PRON joint chief of staff and asked nwhat PRON be do to prevent this what be PRON do to nprepare to deal with this if this nis happen how be PRON do this what be PRON do thirdly PRON should have npicke up the finding that say vladimir if any of nthis be true and PRON doesn t cease to me nthen PRON have a big problem and make PRON clear get to the bottom nof this PRON appear and i do not have access to nclassifie information anymore if what i have heard nover the last weekend of the recent reporting that PRON be in the npresidential daily brief this be something nthat i read every single day as vice president the president read nit every day i be briefed nevery morning before i get to the nwhite house and then again the idea that somehow he ndidn t know or isn t be brief be bad duty the good way for nme to end this i be talk to PRON wife and i don t see PRON get noutrage very often but PRON start asking nwhat would PRON have do if bo be still nin harm way this information ncame out and of the president nbo be PRON son i m sorry i apologize PRON serve in iraq nfor a year what be those parents nthinke out there what be those son and ndaughter husband and wife it be a dereliction nof duty if any of this is neven remotely true i think the npresident have a lot to answer nfor and PRON should get the nanswer quickly if these allegations nare true and PRON do nothing then nin fact i think the public should nunrelate to PRON running that this man be not fit nto be president of the united states nof america i be tell nbc mike a lot of PRON see you non the campaign trail you re still locked nin a very difficult nomination battle the poll show PRON with a sizable nnational lead i wonder where PRON think the race stand at this nmoment and what keep PRON up at night as you nlook ahead and if PRON can maintain this nadvantage without campaign in a ntraditional way especially this fall when nvoter begin to tune in this be the most nunusual campaign in modern history but i start off with nthe present this that i m go to follow nthe docs order not just for PRON but nfor the country that mean that i m not ngoing to be hold rally PRON all be here but the school have put the circle around everyone have their nmask on i have gone nto PRON state and pennsylvania and i have traveled nabout when i do i get in make PRON case nand leave but PRON know PRON i would nmuch rather be out there with people because nthat be where i get the greatest nfeel i can get a sense of the look in PRON eyes nand the plane of voice that PRON have of what nthey be concern about but notwithstanding that ni have be surprise into the ion area as nwe probably reach more people directly nwith one on one particularly those of nyou that be with the television station you nall know that when PRON be on you re have a none to one conversation with someone out there because there be one nperson look at PRON i ve never thought nof PRON before PRON tell PRON million npeople have watch what i have do from home and of the half a dozen nthing PRON have go out and do i think be probably ncommunicate directly in detail with nmore people than PRON would nhave otherwise i would much rather nbe do PRON in person so far PRON remain to nbe see i don t want to jinx PRON and i know nthe polling datum be very good but i think nit be a very early it be much too early nto make any judgment PRON have a lot more work nto do and i plan on lay out in detail why neconomic plan as to how PRON recover from this PRON be work PRON out nin detail on what i m go to do if i am nelecte president a don t know if that nanswer PRON question have PRON requested na classify briefing as PRON would nentitle to be PRON have not and as this proceed i nmay very well do that i ve be talk to ni have a significant foreign policy staff nas PRON know that do those job i have a lot of meeting with PRON former secretaries nof state and get into what they nhave hear so far but if PRON doesn t get ncleare up quickly then i will seek and ask nif i can be brief have PRON begin to nprepare for debate i can hardly wait over the weekend nprinceton decide to remove woodrow wilson s nname from PRON school and building due to nhis racist thinking president trump ncalle that incredible stupidity nyesterday what PRON think about the decision and the npresident comment and more broadly as the nnation be in this moment of reckon PRON see the removal of nstatue and name from institution and school do PRON think this be the nright approach to come to term with PRON nations nhistory and PRON leader i think there are nthree category any institution that nchose the name and now want to get rid of that name that their ndecision to make i m assume the board nof trustee make the judgment about the nword rural of the woodrow wilson school that be the institution nthat choose the name and now no longer must be nassociated with PRON i think the president nsecondly i think there be a distinction nbetween the former mayor of nnew orleans say a difference between reminder and nremembrance of history and recover from history the idea of comparing nwhether or not george washington nowne slave or thomas jefferson owned nslaves and someone who be in rebellion committing ntreason and try to take down a nunion to keep slavery there be a distinction i think the idea of nbringe down all of those confederate nmonument through confederate soldier and ngeneral who strongly support secession nand maintain slavery and go to war nto do PRON those statue along in museum with regard to those nstatue that be in monument like the jefferson memorial ni think there be an obligation that the government nprotect those monument because they nare different at some point it be a remembrance it be not nrevering someone who have that view PRON may have things nin PRON past that be now and then distasteful nbut that be a judgment for example take down the christopher columbus nstatue george washington or etc i nthink that something that the government has nan opportunity and responsibility to protect nfrom happen on a different subject nyou have be do these public event for nthe past month which have put PRON in contact nwith more people have PRON be test for ncoronavirus and if so how frequently are nyou do that i have not be tested nfor the coronavirus for two reason one i have have no nsymptoms as PRON mother would say knock on wood nand number two i haven t want to take nanyone else place in the process but the secret service nall get test PRON be around PRON home nand anyone who come into PRON home including nstaff be test to determine whether nthey have the virus i expect what i m going nto do so doesn t look like i m move in the front of nthe line here be be test relatively soon PRON daughter have been nteste and be in florida and she be a social nworker work with boy and girl club before PRON could come nhome PRON have be test twice to make sure that PRON is nclear and quarantine PRON live in nphiladelphia but i have not yet i have not been nteste yet i have to make sure nthat i get the wilmington newspaper here nbefore i leave or i will be dead thank PRON mr nvice president PRON hope that PRON do this nthrough november as often as possible i the more i have nan opportunity i will yesterday PRON say at na fundraiser regard that PRON will confront potent and makes nclear that PRON will have a price to npay in interference in PRON democratic process specifically what would nyou do to put in if this be true and in ngeneral for what be happen in the past i can but i will not nbut i will tell PRON the idea that putin or nany other foreign leader can engage in attempting nto manipulate a presidential election nthe idea that PRON continue PRON activity in central and eastern neurope that he doing the idea that PRON can nbe do without any consequence be not go to happen nif i be president in PRON administration that everything from nmake sure that PRON go to the united state nthe united nations security council all nthe way to impose sanction that would ncommence with the action that PRON have taken nthat have be before that and i have a nvery blind conversation and i think PRON doesn t want PRON to nbe present because PRON know that PRON will have nmore blunt conversation another issue the npresident say he be go to have an updated nlist of potential nominee to the court PRON have say PRON would nput a black woman on the court should a spot open nup but there be group call for PRON to put some specific nnames on the court i hate to follow nanythe the president die because PRON usually ndoe PRON all wrong PRON be put together na list of group of african american women nthat be qualified and have the experience nto be in the court i m not going nto release that until PRON go further down nthe line of set PRON just like logical nquestion about vice president i m not release the nnames of all the vice presidential potential nnominee and there be number nof woman of color there be latino women nthere be asian there be across the board and nwe be just underway now in the hard event nof go into the deep background check to ntake anywhere from week and early august will be the target this be a two part nquestion just to follow up again on russia do PRON believe that if nthose report be true that trump be guilty of nviolate PRON oath of office on PRON vp choice you nhave say that PRON want PRON run mate to be nready on day one to do the job do PRON think that someone nwho do not have national security or nforeign policy can be ready on day one one of the thing you ntry to do i have talk in length over the years nwith president obama about this PRON try to find npeople who have a background and nexpertise that PRON may not have one of the reasons npresident obama pick PRON be because i nhad considerable experience and getting nthing do in congress and secondly i had nexperience in foreign policy although PRON have clear nviews of what PRON want to do and PRON strategy be in nterm of americans PRON be look for nsomeone who have day to day experience and nknew a lot of the world leader although that a nhelpful thing to have it be not necessary nbecause i start off with the two places ni still have expertise be in both of those nplace and unite the country in congress nand foreign policy PRON almost all of the women ni m consider have have some exposure to foreign policy nand national defense issue but that be not a minimum nrequirement the requirement be that PRON have the nintellectual capacity as well as the temperament na well as the leadership qualities nthat land everyone to believe that nthey way to be ready on day one to be npresident of the united states of america with regard to whether nor not the president PRON depend on exactly what nhe do and what PRON know but at a minimum PRON either doesn t nunderstand PRON job and be have difficulties nsitte down and read a report because a lot nof PRON cross that PRON say PRON didn t read it nor see or know PRON i don t know he ncannot read or no so many different things nthat have come up over the last three year but PRON be clearly a ndereliction of duty and PRON be clearly something that i think everyone ninclude PRON republican friends nand opponent in the house and senate are nworrie about as well where be the wilmington the delaware nnews channel that PRON hometown team like other state delaware nis see an increase in covid case PRON have a message for state and local ngovernment of how PRON have handle PRON so far nand how PRON need to handle PRON go forward i think PRON have nhandle PRON so far very well but PRON see nthe governor make some adjustments nbecause there have be an uptake PRON be one of the nstates i get brief every day by a group of lead doctors naround of the country every day i get a print nout and have PRON in the book of the nstates that be do better and do bad up until now there has nbeen a decline and now it be opening nup slightly i have not speak to the ngovernor today but PRON guess be that PRON be go to be nlooke very closely at what happen on the delray beach is nand how that occur and restaurant and bar i don t know enough nto know that the good news is nit have find out bad news there s na slight uptick i have not gone ninto the detail so i don t have any nadvice because i don t know where it s npoppe up i m go to nget in trouble i know tell PRON i will nbe late just a little bit i always get in ntrouble on the last question the response to this npandemic have become very politicized even wearing na mask have become political if elect how will you nget americans on the same page can PRON plan be nsuccessful if PRON be not i m go to try nto say this politely the way to get on the nsame page be to lower the rhetoric based non division stop appeal to the less healthy nside of society instead of when a ngolf cart go by yell white supremacy nand the president tweet PRON out don t do things nlike that bring the country ntogether PRON be give a portion nof the population who have respond to the a free pass and it ngenerate division PRON be also talk in nterm of the president talk about manhood nand be strong and not needing nthe mass PRON have to start nappealing to the well side of human nnature by point out that the mask be not so nmuch to protect PRON it be if i have nan undiagnose condition it protect nyou against PRON be to protect nother people it call patriotism nand responsibility it call make sure nthat PRON look out for the other person PRON have spent ntoo much time and if PRON notice the npresident put everything in nterm of PRON i m not be facetious everything be PRON it be i don t think nor i don t take responsibility or i did nnot do that or i believe that it be not about ni it be about PRON i think changing nthe tone of the administration nacross the board allow scientists nto speak make sure that people nunderstand the fact good bad and ended ndifferent and when a mistake is nmade PRON say PRON make a mistake PRON be wrong PRON you nshouldn t have do PRON that way i think all of those nthing change the atmosphere i m apologize PRON have nheard PRON say this before the word of nthe president matter no matter who the npresident be no matter how nresponsible or irresponsible the npresident be whomever PRON or PRON is npresident can take PRON to war or bring peace can have markets nrise or fall appeal to the senior nside of humanity or PRON well angel PRON matter it nreally matter i think it s nabout the tone i think PRON goes nacross the board i know that i nwa criticize legitimately during nthe primary by say that i planned non united and the country PRON have to do that if PRON can not do that nwe can not function PRON have to bring the ncountry together on this piece if nin fact PRON stand up by the way don t nhold PRON to number PRON can correct PRON i think something like n of the american people enqueue should nwear a mask i think PRON should nbe talk to PRON well angels nand make feel indirectly guilty nfor not do the right thing appeal to the nbetter nature i know that sounds nalmost idealistic but it be not remind people PRON don t wear this nmask PRON end up hurt someone or PRON get infect PRON take them nto PRON child PRON could take PRON home nto PRON mother father husband wife PRON have a moral nobligation because PRON really be i really do have to go i m go to get nin real trouble thank PRON go ahead ni m sorry i m a little confused nabout the delineation of the destruction nof monument americans be confederate monument worthy of preservation without the vote of local nelecte official i think it a nvery different pain be well if they nare take down like PRON took nthe confederate flag off of the nmississippi but i can understand nhis anger and anguish that people feel by have for years nand year be under the statute the statue of nrobert e lee it be always better nto do PRON peaceful there be a distinction nbetween those monument i shift responsibility nand i m not i think the elected nofficial have a responsibility to move put PRON in museum get PRON down but don t expect nif PRON have sit in front of you nafter all these year and PRON be finally going nthrough another phase of may be respond to the nsystemic racism in america and what PRON have nseen happen don t be surprised if nsomeone pull down the statue of jefferson ndavis it be well that they ndo not but it fundamentally different than pull down the nstatue or go to the lincoln memorial nand try to pull not the lincoln nmemorial that be a bad example the jefferson memorial will PRON commit nto three debate yes i m committed nto follow the national ndebate group that set up these ndebates who PRON pick as the moderators nthree of PRON PRON have be this way nfor a long time the first one be a

58,T5pTdbSMcrI,biden,2020-07-14T18:58:46Z,Joe Biden Delivers Remarks On His “Build Back Better” Plan For An Equitable Clean Energy Future,speech,"JOE BIDEN: Good afternoon. I'm here today to talk about
infrastructure and jobs on
a clean energy future, but I
have to start by speaking about what
millions of Americans know when they
wake up every morning with worry,
anxiety and fear. We're still a country
in crisis. The pandemic has
affected more than 3 million
Americans. It has cost more than 135,000 lives,
and climbing. And it shows no signs of slowing down. In just the last few days, 19 states reported record cases, including Florida,
which saw more than 15,000
new cases in a single day. Hospitalizations
and deaths, two of the most
concerning indicators of
Trump Trump's failed response,
are already unacceptably
high, and they are rising. It's gotten bad enough that even Donald Trump finally decided to wear a mask in public. I'm glad he made
the shift, but Mr President, it's not enough. We won't be able to turn the corner and get American people
back to work safely without
presidential leadership. Mr President, open everything
now isn't a strategy for success. It's barely a slogan slogan. Quit pushing the false choice between
protecting our health and
protecting our economy. All it does is endanger our recovery on both fronts. Mr President, please listen
to your public health experts
instead of denigrating them. Do your job, Mr President,
because if we can't
deal with the public health crisis, we can't deal with
the economic crisis or deal
with almost 18 million Americans
who are out of work, and the incredible pain
inflicted on small businesses and communities of color. We can't deal with
the climate crisis that
could cost us and cast us into an even darker and more
permanent shadow that would
loom over the country
and the world for a long time. We won't be able to do
what Americans have always done,
come back stronger than
ever before, with the grit,
toughness and resilience that characterizes
who we are. That's what
I want to talk about today. Last week, I shared the outlines
of my plan to Build
Back Better build, a bold
plan to build an economy of
the future, not an economy
of the past. And the first
plank of that plan rejects
the defeatist view that automation and globalization
mean we can't ensure our future
is made in America, with American good-paying union
jobs, here at home, making it in America. We clearly can. Today I'm here
in Wilmington to talk about a second plank, how we can create millions of high-paying union jobs by building a moderate infrastructure
and a clean energy future. These are the
most critical investments we
can make for the long-term health and vitality of both the American economy and the physical health
and safety of the American people. Even if we weren't
facing a pandemic and an economic crisis, we should
be making these investments
anyway. One in five miles of our highways are
still in ""poor condition,"" according
to the American engineers. Tens of thousands of
bridges are in disrepair and
some on the verge of collapse,
present presenting a clear and present danger
to people's lives lives. Tens of millions of
Americans lack access to high-speed broaden. To get our people to work safely, to power clean energy
revolution in this country we need to modernize America's infrastructure. Despite this overwhelming
need, this president and
the Republican Congress have
simply failed to act. There's no other way of saying it. To continue to break the promises they've
made to the American people. Donald Trump promised a big infrastructure
bill when he ran in 2016. He promised it again in 2017. And then in 2018, and again in 2019. And now he's
promising one again. It seems like every few weeks, when
he needs a distraction from
the lateest charges of corruption
in his staff, or the
conviction of high-ranking members of administration
and political apparatus, the
White House nouns it's""
infrastructure week."" How many
times have you heard him say that? But he's never delivered. He's never really even tried. Well, I know
how to get it done. In 2009, President Obama and I inherited an economy in freefall,
and we prevented another Great Depression. We enacted the largest infrastructure
plan since president
Eisenhower's system. Not only creating good-paying jobs but improving the safety and security of
people on our roads. We made the largest investment in
clean energy in the history
of the United States of America, $90 billion. It put us on a path toward a
thriving clean energy economy,
powering new economic growth
and reducing energy cost. Here we are now with an economy in crisis, but with an incredible opportunity
not just to build
back to where we were before
but better, stronger, more
resilient and more prepared for the challenges that
lie ahead. And there's no more convention challenge
that we must meet in
the next decade than the onrushing
climate crisis. Left unchecked, it is literally
an existential threat to the
health of our planet and to our very survival. That's enough for dispute, Mr President. When Donald Trump
thinks about climate change, the only word he can muster
is hoax. When I think
about climate change, the word
I think of is jobs, good-paying,
union jobs that have
put Americans to work, making the air cleaner for our kids to breathe, restoring our crumbling roads
and bridges and ports, making
it faster, cheaper and clean
cleaner to transport American-made goods all across
the country and around the world. Jobs. Jobs to build
and install a network of 500,000
charging stations along
our existing and new highways
we build across this
country, which will not only
help America and the American
automobile industry lead
the world with American-made
vehicles but saving Americans
billions of dollars over time in the cost of gasoline
for their vehicles. Jobs that lay the lines for the
second great railroad revolution,
which will not only slash pollution; it will slash commute times
and open up investment in areas connected to
metropolitan centers for the
first time. When Donald Trump thinks about renewable
energy, he sees windmills somehow causing cancer. When I think about these
windmills, I see American manufacturing, American workers racing
to dominate the global market. I see the steel
that will be needed for those
windmill platforms, towers
and lad ladders that
can be made in small manufacturers
like the manage Gregor
industries. I was in Scranton
last week. I see the union
trade and certified men
and women who will manufacture
and install it all. I see the ports that will come
back to life, the long shore
shoremen, the shipbuilders, the communities
they support. When Donald Trump talks about improving
efficiency by retrofitting lighting systems with LED bulbs, remember what he said? He said he doesn't like LED because ""the
lights no good. I always look
orange."" The light's no good. I always look orange. When I think about energy
retrofitting for lighting, I see the incredible projects
like the one right here
in the Chase center. I see small businesses
like preferred electric that design and install award-winning
energy conservation measures, reduce consumption of electricity and save businesses hundreds of thousands of dollars in energy costs per year. I see master electricians
and union workers who went through union apprenticeships,
who start off with good wages and quality benefits
that only grow from there. These investments are our win-win-win for this country, creating jobs, cutting energy cost, protecting our climate. That's why today I'm releaseing my plan to mobilize millions
of jobs by building sustainable infrastructure and an equitable clean energy future. In my first four years, we're
going to give 4 million buildings
all across this country
the same energy make makeover
that you get here at Chase Center. It's going to create
at least 1 million jobs in construction,
engineering and manufacturing
in order to get it done. It's going to make places,
the places where we work,
we live, we learn, healthier,
improving indoor air quality
quality, water quality. It's going to save tens
of billions of dollars in energy
cost over time. That's all real. We're not just going to focus on commercial
spaces, though. We're going to give direct support to help families do
the same thing for their homes. We're going to offer
cash rebates and low-cost
financing to upgrade energy efficient appliances and windows, improvements
that will cut their monthly
energy bills and over time save them thousands of
dollars a year. We're going to
make a major investment to build 1.5 million new energy
efficient homes and public housing units that will
benefit all the communities
three times over by alleviating affordable housing
crisis, by increasing energy efficiency and
by reducing the racial wealth
gap linked to home ownership. Last week, I talked
about using the purchasing
power of the federal government to reinvigorate domestic manufacturing. That's what we're going
to do with the American automobile
industry as well. The United States owns and maintains an enormous fleet
of vehicles vehicles. We're going to convert
these government fleets to electric
vehicles, made and sourceed
right here in the United States of America, with
the government providing the
demand and the grants to retool
factories that are struggling to compete. The US auto industry and
its deep banks of suppliers
will step up, expanding capacity
so that the United States, not China, leads
the world in clean vehicle
production. We're going to make it easier for American consumers to switch to electric vehicles
as well, not only by building
500,000 charging stations but by offering rebates and incentives to
swap older, fuel-efficient
vehicles for new, clean, made-in-America vehicles, saving
hundreds of billions of
-- millions of barrels of oil
on an annual basis. Together this will immediate 1 million new good-paying jobs in the automobile industry, and supply chain and the associated infrastructure needed to get it done. We also know that
transforming the American electrical sector to produce power without producing carbon pollution and
electrifying an increased
share of our economy will
be the greatest spurring of job
creation and economic competitiveness
in the 21st century. That's why we're
going to achieve a carbon pollution-free
center by the year 2035. We need to get to work
on it right away. We'll need the scientists
at the national labs, the land grant university, the
HBCUs HBCUs, to improve is
not innovate technologies needed to generate, store
and transmit this clean energy. We need the engineers to design them, the workers to manufacture them. We need ironworkers
and welders to install them. We'll become the world's
largest export exporter of these technologies,
creating even more jobs jobs. We know how to do this. You're administration
rescued the auto industry
and helped it retool, made
solar energy the same cost
as traditional energy, weatherized more than a million
homes, and we'll do it again,
but this time bigger
and faster and smarter. As we do this work, we need
to remind -- we need to be
mindful of the historical wrongs and
damage that American industries have
done in the 20th century, inflicting
environmental harm on the poor and vulnerable communities
so often black and brown and Native American communities, polluted air, polluted water, toxins
raining down from communities
that bore environmental and health burdens but
shared none of the profits. Growing up, breathing that
in every day, it's poison,
and it's partly why there are such incredible rates of childhood asthma
in black and brown communities,
why black Americans,
are almost three times
more likely to die of asthma-related
causes than white Americans. It's cancer alley in St James parish in Louisiana. That's the cancer causing
clusters along Route
9 in Delaware. That's why today
I'm also release releasing
a state of the environment justice policy that build on my existing plan. This is an area
of in incredible opportunity for economic growth for our
country, but we have to make
sure that the first people that benefit from
this are the people who are most basically hurt by it historically in the last century, by
the structural disparities that exist. I'm setting a goal
to make sure that these front-line
and fenceline communities, whether in rural
places or cities, receive
40 per cent of the benefit from the investments we're
making in housing, in pollution reduction, in workforce development, in transportation,
across the board. We're also going to create jobs
for people by cleaning up the
environmental hazards that have now
been abandon abandoned. I saw the front page of the Times
two weeks ago. All these places that are going bankrupt
except for the benefit that's going, millions
of dollars going to the CEOs. More than a quarter
million jobs right away to
do things like plugging millions of abandoned oil
and gas wells that exist all
across the country, posing daily
threats to the health and safety of our
communities. We're going to hold accountable
those CEO CEOs that benefit
from decades of subsidies, then
just walked away from their responsibilities
to these communities, leaving the wells to leak,
polluteants to continue to spew greenhouse gases flowing into the air
and the water. We're going to go after those golden
parachutes the CEOs gave themselves
before declaring bankruptcy
to make sure the workers
receive the benefits and
retirement they were promised. Let's create new markets
for our family farmers and our
ranchers, a new modern-day civilian climate corps
to heal our public lands, to make us less vulnerable
to wildfires and floods. Look, these aren't pie-in-the-sky dreams. These are actionable policies
that we can get to work on right away. We can live up to our responsibilities, meet
the challenges of a world at risk
of a climate catastrophe, build more
climate resilient communities,
put millions of skilled workers
on the job and make life markedly better and safer for the American people
all at once and benefit the
world in the process. The alternative, continue to ignore the facts, deny
reality, focus only on on technology
of the last century instead of inventing the technology that will define this century. It's just plain un-American not to. This is all Donald Trump and the Republicans offer, backward-looking
policies that will harm the environment, make communities let healthy, hold back economic
promise, while other
countries race ahead. It's a mindset that doesn't have
any faith in the capacity
of the American people to compete, to innovate and to win. It's never been a
good bet to bet against the American
people. When you do,
it will exact a deadly cost. I know better. I know you do as well. I know what the American
people are capable of. I know what American
workers can accomplish when given the
room to run. I know that
climate change is a challenge
that's going to define our American future. I know meeting the
challenge will be a once once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to
jolt new life into our economy,
strengthen our global leadership
and protect our planet for future generations. If I have the honor
to be elected president, we're
not just going to tinker
around the edges. We're going to make
historic investments that will seize
the opportunity and meet this moment in history. We're going to get to
work delivering results right away, on day one. We're going to reverse Trump's rollbacks of 100 public health and environmental rules, and then forge a
path to greater ambition. We're going to get
back into the Paris agreement, back into the
business of leading the world. We're going to lock in progress
that no future president can
roll back or undercut to take
us backward again. Science requires a timetable for measuring progress on climate that isn't three decades
or even two. Science tells us we have nine years
before the damage is irreversible. So my timetable
results is in my first
four years of president, the ir irreversible steps we'll take to mitigate
and adapt to the climate
change and put our nation
on the road to net zero emissions no later than 2050. So let's not waste any more time. Let's get to
work now, now.

60,zIVdxsiu_r4,biden,2020-07-21T18:32:25Z,Joe Biden Unveils $775 Billion ‘Build Back Better’ Plan to Boost Child and Elderly Care,speech,as a reminder today's event has been set up to adhere to social distancing guideline guidelines as outlined by health experts thank you good afternoon everybody i want to thank the colonial early education program here in calwick center for for hosting us tonight you know uh i just met sarah johnson i thought i saw sarah somewhere in here but she has a uh her three-year-old son noah who's a student here she said this program does wonders helping noah learn his letters and numbers and socialize with other kids and understand his his emotions and develop his personality and i met him he's what a bright cute young man but like so many parents she's worried she's worried about her job as a dental assistant and the and notching changes in uh in what she has to do to make things work uh she has she's noticing changes in noah's behavior since he hasn't been in school since march as a matter of fact he said to the principal where my teacher can i stay here and play is when we were in his classroom and she she's had to learn or lean on her parents which many many people have to do to to help her get through it and it's really tough the parents like sarah places like this center and the caregivers and educators who work here also give me a great deal of hope you know reinforcing my absolute determination that i've been pushing for over two years to triple the amount of money for title one schools and in those districts like this one where every child every child in title one district is able to have the benefits of an education at three and four years of age that's why i couldn't think of a better place to talk about the third plank of my build back better plan for the economy this is about easing the squeeze on working families who are raising their kids and caring for aged loved ones at the same time sometimes separately but many times together it's about creating jobs with better pay and career pathways for caregivers and showing them that dignity and respect that they deserve but i know it's hard i know it's hard to think of a future when you're just trying to get through the crisis at hand i know that the uh that the case of child care facilities across the nation is dire people are looking for help desperately and they've had to close their doors and lay off staff and they're not getting the protective equipment they need to reopen and the virus hot spots where they exist and they exist all over the nation they can't reopen at all and we're in a child care emergency and it didn't have to be this way that's why i'm calling on the president to get the facilities and the resources and the equipment that are needed and get them to them now enough each day the pandemic death toll grows each day in some states more people test positive the day before and each day too many american workers are still out of work and losing hope it's been reported by the president's staff that the president is quote not really working this anymore he doesn't want to be distracted by it doesn't want to be distracted by it his own staff admits that donald trump fails the most important test of being an american president the duty to care for you for all of us you know it's also been reported that he'll block any funding for more testing and tracing in the next covert relief bill which is being discussed right now on the floor of the united states congress just as states report record cases and hospitalizations and deaths continue to rise this man simply doesn't understand he can't deal with our economic crisis without serving and saving and solving the public health crisis for all his bluster about his expertise on the economy he's unable to explain how it'll actually help working families hit the hardest you know he's quit on you and he's quit on this country but this election is not just about him it's about us it's about you it's about what we'll do what a president is supposed to do president's supposed to care to lead to take responsibility to never give up that's what presidents are supposed to do over the last two weeks i've shared my agenda for economic recovery i call it buildback better because we can't just build back to the way things were before we have to do it better and the first plank of my buildback better plan rejects the defeatist view that automat that automation and globalization mean we can ensure american workers lead to a future made in america made in america the second plank helps us out compete the rest of the world and tackle climate change i'll put millions of americans to work and good union jobs modernizing our infrastructure while building a clean energy future increasing jobs today i'm outlining the third plank of my build back better program mobilizing a 21st century care and elderly childhood education workforce to deal with the caregiving crisis and it's a crisis in this country if we truly want to reward work in this country we have to ease the financial burden of care that families are carrying we have to elevate the compensation of those providing the care the benefits and dignity of caregiving workers and early childhood educators even before the pandemic millions of working families are faced with enormous financial and personal strength strains trying to raise their kids and care for their parents or loved ones who are living with disabilities this is the so-called sandwich generation includes everyone from an 18 year old daughter caring for a mom who suddenly gets sick to a year 40-year-old dad raising his child and caring for his own aging parents the joy and love are always there but it's hard i know it's hard it's really really hard families are squeezed emotionally and financially they need help but too often they can't afford it and the professional caregivers out there the home health care workers child care workers or more often women women of color and immigrants are too often underpaid unseen and undervalued the pandemic hits and squeezes and tightens on everybody nursing homes have been hit hard if you're a front line worker you struggle to find safe child care for your kids others of you become unexpected 24 7 caregivers trying to keep your children safe and learning while you continue to work remotely from home if you had to put your career on hold indefinitely or senior hours cut or your job lost the confusion the confusion over school reopening only makes things worse you know in the last few months has only underscored how vital it is for families and older americans to have more home care and community care choices that fit their real needs you know we're trapped in a caregiving crisis within an economic crisis within a health care crisis you're doing everything you can but this president is not if i'm your president here's what i would do first let's start by caring for aging relatives and loved ones with disabilities helping them live independently here's an example right now there are 800 000 people who are eligible for home and community care through medicaid who've already signed up for it but they're waiting for a phone call phone call back for some the wait is five years five years my plan makes a bold investment so states can clear the waiting list to make sure we ease the financial burden for more families going forward we have to make long-term federal investments we'll have a major innovation fund to allow states to test and expand successful ways to improve home and community care and increase prevention and reduce the cost of hospitalization think of think of expanded vital services like rides to appointments meals day programs for seniors making their home safer them it builds on an innovative and created provision under the affordable care act the very program the president ceaselessly is trying to gut for example there is a pilot program now in 27 cities in 16 states where a nurse an occupational therapist and a handyman come to the home that's caring for an aging family member they might not be able to cure mom's alzheimer's but they can make sure she doesn't break her hip so they walk through the house this is what's going on now and they install handrails in the right spots in the house in the bathroom or they fix the door that's stuck so she doesn't trip while she tries to open it it initially found that about three thousand dollars in program costs yield more than twenty thousand dollars in saving to the government from hospitalization to other reasons simple steps to save lives save money and provide critical peace of mind here's another example whether you live in rural north carolina or central philadelphia people of color are economically distressed communities face punishing health disparities from a system of systemic discrimination they don't have health insurance they don't see a doctor sometimes language is a barrier and they slip through the cracks slip through the gaps so their treatable condition because they can't afford to go to the doctor becomes a chronic condition that's why community health workers are real heroes they go into these communities they make sure folks are getting the care they need my plan puts to work 150 000 more of these workers in our communities throughout the country these are the things we can do now secondly we can also make high quality child care affordable and accessible my child care plan is straightforward straightforward every three and four-year-old child will get access to free high quality preschool like students have here and low and middle income families won't spend more than seven percent of their income on child care for children under the age of five most hard-pressed working families won't have to spend a dime here's how it works we can either they can either decide to get up to an 8 000 tax credit for child care for middle class family with a couple young kids spending 300 bucks a week on child care that means an annual savings of eight thousand dollars in their pocket because it's a tax credit it means everything for working families living paycheck to paycheck or the federal government would send funding to states which then work with child care providers to cover the cost for working families with young children over seven percent of their income would not have to be would not have to be spent so say both parents are working working and need child care you go to childcare.gov which is created under the obama biden administration to help fund child care that works for you under my plan it takes you to your state website local child care centers pop up you can call or fill in your information you apply to which one you want to go to the state then sends you a letter saying you're approved and lays out the amount you're going to pay the state sends that information to the child care provider and then the state reimburses the child care center on the back end you just pay what you're supposed to pay not a dime for some working families and no more than seven percent for anyone else you can do that this would save families thousands of dollars but more importantly give them peace of mind there's other common sense steps we can take like expanding tax credits for businesses to build child care facilities on site so you can go to work with your child put them in a child care center that the company got money for a tax credit for building supporting more and more and giving peace of mind to a family and when you're finished work take that child home supporting more aftercare weekend and summer cares for fam programs or families third we expand access to caregiving we need to pay and support caregivers beyond what they are now they're doing god's work but home health workers aren't paid much they have few benefits 40 percent are still on snap or medicaid so my plan is direct it gives caregivers and early childhood educators much needed raise no one should have to work more than one job to make ends meet under my health care plan that defends and expands obamacare there will be more affordable health insurance i'll make sure these workers have an effective way to unionize and collectively bargain and protect their rights and earn benefits this plan will help workers especially those without a college degree help them gain new skills in good pain industries like health care it provides new pathways to advance their careers for example a home health care worker can have access to training needed to become an emt or a nurse or physician's assistant or even a doctor or the early childhood educator can receive coaching to keep delivering high quality learning experience we can do this the bottom line is that a mobilized caregiving and early education workforce would save families time and money get their loved ones the care and early childhood education they need and put more people to work allowing husbands and wives to go back to work and provide many people the opportunity to get a job that's a decent job caring it keeps seniors in their homes it's a triple win if they choose that and recognize the realities facing modern families and provides them the much needed economic support in the middle of a pandemic just imagine if we can put three million americans to work in new care and early childhood education and combined with my proposal to provide families with up to 12 weeks of paid family leave and medical aid we can free up millions more people to join the paid labor force increasing economic growth meaning at least two million additional jobs more economic growth for the nation this is a fresh bold way to build a critical part of the labor force and help us recover faster and stronger we usually talk about jobs packages there's a big push on shovel-ready jobs i'm the guys you may remember manage the recovery act of 800 plus billion dollars we always focused on shovel-ready jobs what we could do immediately to get the money out in communities but that's what care jobs are they are shovel ready the workers are ready now these jobs can be filled now allowing millions of people primarily women to get back to work now increasing the growth of the gdp and family income that's the right thing to do for our families and our most essential workers and it's a smart thing to do for our economy today millions of our people can't fully pursue the jobs and careers they dream of due to the caregiving squeeze that means tens of billions of dollars less in wages each year for our working families means more disruption for our business fewer jobs and growth in our economy slow this is both a moral and an economic imperative for the nation in my view and the way we pay for it is by rolling back unproductive tax cuts some of the two trillion dollar tax cut the president put through closing loopholes unproductive tax cuts for high income real estate investors while ensuring high income earners pay their tax bills we invest that that would add up to 775 billion dollars over 10 years we invest that in building our economy back better than it was before growing the economy stronger and tomorrow i'll be joining a virtual town hall with seic sciu members home care workers fast food workers janitors to hear directly from them about why this matters so much to them because you see this is about something bigger this is about dignity and respect for working people and that's precisely what this election is all about dignity and respect the american people know they're not being afforded dignity and respect to many of their jobs the american president has a duty to care for all of us to see people where they are to understand what they're going through and what they want to be as many of you know i was a single parent for five years after my wife and daughter were killed and my two boys were badly injured even though i had a lot more support than a lot of people going through tough times a day it was hard it was hard if i didn't have my mom my sister and my brother i don't know how i've been able to afford it then six years later when jill and i got married i said how difficult it was for her to start her teaching career while being a new mom with two kids in school we cared well actually they weren't in school yet now that i think about it we cared for our parents at the end my dad was months in hospice in our home same with my mom and our entire family was there for our son bo when they came home from a year in iraq with a cancer that wasn't whether he'd live is just how long he would live we know what it's like months upon months we know so many of you are going through the same thing without the kind of help i had but now everything everything feels different there's just that feeling that sense where you just don't know if everything's going to turn out okay but i'm here to tell you that it can be and it will be you know my dad was an honorable decent man his great regret he never got to go to college my dad like many of your parents got knocked down a few times but he always got back up he worked hard to build a great middle-class life for our family on mayfield and clemont but he used to have a saying he'd say joey i don't expect the government to solve my problems but i sure in hell expect them to understand my problem i understand to my very core and i also know that together we can do this this is america we don't settle we aspire and we succeed so let's get the heck up and get it done let's get to work as i go out of my grandpa you've heard me say this many times got to my grandpop's house up in scranton when dad lost his job when he lived with my grandpa every time he'd walk out she'd tell joey keep the faith and my grandmother y'all know joey spread it let's go spread the faith we can do this there's not a single thing we cannot do thank you for listening i look forward to having your questions at another time but i'm off to another event thank you principal thank you for having us here appreciate it very very much thank you senator [Music] [Music] [Music] you,b as a reminder today event have be set up to adhere to social distancing guideline guideline as outline by health expert

be PRON president here be what i would do first let PRON start by care for age relative and love one with disability help PRON live independently here be an example right now there be people who be eligible for home and community care through medicaid who have already sign up for PRON but PRON be wait for a phone call phone call back for some the wait be five year five year PRON plan make a bold investment so state can clear the waiting list to make sure PRON ease the financial burden for more family go forward PRON have to make long term federal investment PRON will have a major innovation fund to allow state to test and expand successful way to improve home and community care and increase prevention and reduce the cost of hospitalization think of think of expand vital service like ride to appointment meal day program for senior make PRON home safe PRON PRON build on an innovative and created provision under the affordable care act the very program the president ceaselessly be try to gut for example there be a pilot program now in city in state where a nurse an occupational therapist and a handyman come to the home that be care for an age family member PRON may not be able to cure mom alzheimer but PRON can make sure PRON do not break PRON hip so PRON walk through the house this be what be go on now and PRON install handrail in the right spot in the house in the bathroom or PRON fix the door that be stuck so PRON do not trip while PRON try to open PRON PRON initially find that about three thousand dollar in program cost yield more than twenty thousand dollar in save to the government from hospitalization to other reason simple step to save life save money and provide critical peace of mind here be another example whether PRON live in rural north carolina or central philadelphia people of color be economically distressed community face punish health disparity from a system of systemic discrimination PRON do not have health insurance PRON do not see a doctor sometimes language be a barrier and PRON slip through the crack slip through the gap so PRON treatable condition because PRON can not afford to go to the doctor become a chronic condition that be why community health worker be real hero PRON go into these community PRON make sure folk be get the care PRON need PRON plan put to work more of these worker in PRON community throughout the country these be the thing PRON can do now secondly PRON can also make high quality child care affordable and accessible PRON child care plan be straightforward straightforward every three and four year old child will get access to free high quality preschool like student have here and low and middle income family will not spend more than seven percent of PRON income on child care for child under the age of five most hard press work family will not have to spend a dime here be how PRON work PRON can either PRON can either decide to get up to an tax credit for child care for middle class family with a couple young kid spend buck a week on child care that mean an annual saving of eight thousand dollar in PRON pocket because PRON be a tax credit PRON mean everything for work family live paycheck to paycheck or the federal government would send funding to state which then work with child care provider to cover the cost for work family with young child over seven percent of PRON income would not have to be would not have to be spend so say both parent be work work and need child care PRON go to childcare gov which be create under the obama biden administration to help fund child care that work for PRON under PRON plan PRON take PRON to PRON state website local child care center pop up PRON can call or fill in PRON information PRON apply to which one PRON want to go to the state then send PRON a letter say PRON be approve and lay out the amount PRON be go to pay the state send that information to the child care provider and then the state reimburse the child care center on the back end PRON just pay what PRON be suppose to pay not a dime for some work family and no more than seven percent for anyone else PRON can do that this would save family thousand of dollar but more importantly give PRON peace of mind there be other common sense step PRON can take like expand tax credit for business to build child care facility on site so PRON can go to work with PRON child put PRON in a child care center that the company get money for a tax credit for building support more and more and give peace of mind to a family and when PRON be finish work take that child home support more aftercare weekend and summer care for fam program or family third PRON expand access to caregive PRON need to pay and support caregiver beyond what PRON be now PRON be do god work but home health worker be not pay much PRON have few benefit percent be still on snap or medicaid so PRON plan be direct PRON give caregiver and early childhood educator much need raise no one should have to work more than one job to make end meet under PRON health care plan that defend and expand obamacare there will be more affordable health insurance PRON will make sure these worker have an effective way to unionize and collectively bargain and protect PRON right and earn benefit this plan will help worker especially those without a college degree help PRON gain new skill in good pain industry like health care PRON provide new pathway to advance PRON career for example a home health care worker can have access to training need to become an emt or a nurse or physician assistant or even a doctor or the early childhood educator can receive coach to keep deliver high quality learning experience PRON can do this the bottom line be that a mobilize caregiving and early education workforce would save family time and money get PRON love one the care and early childhood education PRON need and put more people to work allow husband and wife to go back to work and provide many people the opportunity to get a job that be a decent job care PRON keep senior in PRON home PRON be a triple win if PRON choose that and recognize the reality face modern family and provide PRON the much need economic support in the middle of a pandemic just imagine if PRON can put three million americans to work in new care and early childhood education and combine with PRON proposal to provide family with up to week of pay family leave and medical aid PRON can free up million more people to join the pay labor force increase economic growth meaning at least two million additional job more economic growth for the nation this be a fresh bold way to build a critical part of the labor force and help PRON recover faster and stronger PRON usually talk about job package there be a big push on shovel ready job PRON be the guy PRON may remember manage the recovery act of plus billion dollar PRON always focus on shovel ready job what PRON could do immediately to get the money out in community but that be what care job be PRON be shovel ready the worker be ready now these job can be fill now allow million of people primarily woman to get back to work now increase the growth of the gdp and family income that be the right thing to do for PRON family and PRON most essential worker and PRON be a smart thing to do for PRON economy today million of PRON people can not fully pursue the job and career PRON dream of due to the caregiving squeeze that mean ten of billion of dollar less in wage each year for PRON work family mean more disruption for PRON business few job and growth in PRON economy slow this be both a moral and an economic imperative for the nation in PRON view and the way PRON pay for PRON be by roll back unproductive tax cut some of the two trillion dollar tax cut the president put through closing loophole unproductive tax cut for high income real estate investor while ensure high income earner pay PRON tax bill PRON invest that that would add up to billion dollar over year PRON invest that in build PRON economy back better than PRON be before grow the economy strong and tomorrow PRON will be join a virtual town hall with seic sciu members home care worker fast food worker janitor to hear directly from PRON about why this matter so much to PRON because PRON see this be about something big this be about dignity and respect for work people and that be precisely what this election be all about dignity and respect the american people know PRON be not be afford dignity and respect to many of PRON job the american president have a duty to care for all of PRON to see people where PRON be to understand what PRON be go through and what PRON want to be as many of PRON know i be a single parent for five year after PRON wife and daughter be kill and PRON two boy be badly injure even though i have a lot more support than a lot of people go through tough time a day PRON be hard PRON be hard if i do not have PRON mom PRON sister and PRON brother i do not know how PRON have be able to afford PRON then six year later when jill and i get marry i say how difficult PRON be for PRON to start PRON teaching career while be a new mom with two kid in school PRON care well actually PRON be not in school yet now that i think about PRON PRON care for PRON parent at the end PRON dad be month in hospice in PRON home same with PRON mom and PRON entire family be there for PRON son bo when PRON come home from a year in iraq with a cancer that be not whether PRON would live be just how long PRON would live PRON know what PRON be like month upon month PRON know so many of PRON be go through the same thing without the kind of help i have but now everything everything feel different there be just that feeling that sense where PRON just do not know if everything be go to turn out okay but PRON be here to tell PRON that PRON can be and PRON will be PRON know PRON dad be an honorable decent man PRON great regret PRON never get to go to college PRON dad like many of PRON parent get knock down a few time but PRON always get back up PRON work hard to build a great middle class life for PRON family on mayfield and clemont but PRON use to have a saying PRON would say joey i do not expect the government to solve PRON problem but i sure in hell expect PRON to understand PRON problem i understand to PRON very core and i also know that together PRON can do this this be america PRON do not settle PRON aspire and PRON succeed so let PRON get the heck up and get PRON do let PRON get to work as i go out of PRON grandpa PRON have hear PRON say this many time get to PRON grandpop house up in scranton when dad lose PRON job when PRON live with PRON grandpa every time PRON would walk out PRON would tell joey keep the faith and PRON grandmother PRON all know joey spread PRON let PRON go spread the faith PRON can do this there be not a single thing PRON can not do thank PRON for listen i look forward to have PRON question at another time but PRON be off to another event thank PRON principal thank PRON for have PRON here appreciate PRON very very much thank PRON senator music music music PRON
61,RWM1AwFf_Xo,biden,2020-07-28T20:32:32Z,Joe Biden delivers his “Build Back Better” economic recovery plan speech and takes question | FULL,speech,good afternoon everyone welcome to kingswood community center actually that's the one down i used to work as a joke you know where you were anyway it's uh it's it's great to be here and uh back uh a place where uh you know uh i want to thank wayne jefferson for uh having us here at the hicks anderson center everybody from delaware everybody knew who hicks was he was deeply involved in social justice issues and politics in the state for a long time and was really very much engaged back in the days when when after dr king was assassinated and this city was in flames and uh he was a good friend a good friend and i want to thank him for i used to work over in the east side and i i got to know hicks very well because he did a lot of work over there as well and uh you know folks here at this center as wayne will tell you doing god's work this community center gives people hope and uh and a place to belong i saw hope as a senator when as i said uh i watched my son the attorney general of delaware beau biden he would attend mass at sacred heart just up the street here and then he'd walk here with his notebook in hand and pocket and sit around for the better part of the day and see if he could find ways to help and see what they may need or not need and it was on the as i said the east side where i uh when i was a teenage lifeguard and my career as a public defender started that's how i got so involved with the community and this center as i said is named after my buddy hicks anderson he was everybody's friend hicks and i went went way way back you know we just walk around wilmington and everyone everyone has a story about hicks how he cared how he always is there for you and how he built a wonderful family including twin sons who gave back so much to this community continue to do they they served in the united states army and now they're serving jointly as the poet laureates of the state of delaware and uh and uh um namdi is a state representative and hicks and his family and uh everyone else at this center embodied the defining story of uh of america for generations americans who are black brown native american immigrants have always been found they pushed out not fully included from our democracy in our economy and it's by pure courage heart and grit they never gave up as they pursued the full the full promise of america that's the story of the people of this community and of this country that's why i couldn't think of a more meaningful place to talk about my build back better economic agenda a bold practical plan that's going to help build a stronger and a more just and sustainable economy for everybody everybody this time included and it's a story of two civil rights heroes we lost last week one who one who shows the way forward each of them their separate ways reverend c.t vivian who faced down drownings beatings and his comment was you can't turn your back upon the idea of justice enormous courage and my friend an american hero congressman john lewis who crossed the edmond pettis bridge one last time on sunday who once said freedom is not a state it's an act i've been over the bridge twice once with him and i thought i knew a lot about it until you walk that bridge and some of you have done it and you get to the crest of the bridge the first time you can see down the other side when i walked over with him a couple years ago i thought to myself what in god's name did it take in terms of eternal fortitude courage to walk down there seeing those folks with clubs and on horses waiting at the bottom of the bridge with no way back i spoke to john just before he died he was on his deathbed and they said he could talk he wanted to talk instead of answering my concerns for him he asked about me he asked about us he asked that we stay focused on the work left undone to heal this nation to remain undaunted by the public health crisis and the economic crisis taking the blinders off in this crisis and showed the systemic racism for what it is that plagues this nation people have seen now those people allowed them to shelter in place all those folks risking their lives stacking the shelves in the supermarkets farming the food getting it to our tables all those folks most of whom are black and brown one thing the senate and the president can do right away is pass right away pass the bill to restore the voting rights act just yesterday it was renamed in the congress in memory of john lewis you know back the effusive praise we heard since he passed especially for many of our republican friends back it was some action protect that sacred right to vote that he was willing to die for if they don't i've been saying all along it's one of the first things i'll do as president if elected we can't let the fundamental right to vote be denied especially in the middle as this pandemic rages on nearly 150 000 dead from cover 19 and counting more than four million americans have tested positive and county black and latinos are three times as likely to be infected and twice as likely to die from the virus as white people more than 30 million and counting are collecting unemployment checks black unemployment is at 15 percent latino 14.5 40 40 of black owned businesses 440 000 in total have reported they had to shut down and everything is worse is worse than by this crisis of presidential leadership to change the tone over the last few days as trump has doesn't change the facts of the last four years donald trump faces a real test and he's failed it the basic threshold of being president the duty to care for the entire country not just as re-election prospects he's shown that he can't beat the pandemic and keep you safe he can't turn the economy around and get america back to work and he is horrifyingly and not surprisingly intentionally stoking the flames of division and racism in this country i've said from the outset of the recent protests that there's no place for violence or destruction of property peaceful protesters should be protected and arsonists and anarchists should be prosecuted and local law enforcement can do that when president obama and i were in office we protected federal property we're able to do it without the department of homeland security turning it into a private militia and it could be done today but that wouldn't help trump's political interest he's determined to stoke division and chaos it's not good for the country but donald trump doesn't care his campaign is failing and he's looking for a political lifeline this isn't about law and order it's about a political strategy to revive a failing campaign every instinct trump has is to add fuel to the fire it's the last thing the last thing we need we need leadership we'll calm the waters and lower the temperature that's how we'll restore peace in the streets but this election is not just about voting against donald trump it's about rising to this moment of crisis understanding people's trouble struggles and building a future worthy of their courage and their ambition to overcome last month i stopped at bethel amy church here in wilmington not far from here i talked to a group of faith and local leaders they shared their pain their anger and the frustration at the state of affairs state affairs in our justice system our health care system our politics our economy there's just a sense and it's real that the deck is stacked stacked against the community the common theme was how do we break the cycle in good times communities of color still lagged in bad times they get hit first and the hardest and in recovery they take the longest to bounce back this is about justice i proposed a criminal justice reform a policing reform agenda that i'm committed to working with the congress to see it through as president it's also about jobs good paying jobs financial stability building wealth for families of cover of color and passing it down to their kids it's about economic growth for our country and outperforming the rest of the world to stay ahead it's also about dignity for working people and the middle class many of you heard me say it before my dad had an expression he said joey a job's about a lot more than a paycheck it's about your dignity it's about respect it's about your place in the community and by saying it's about being able to look your kid in the eye and say honey it's gonna be okay and mean it over fifty percent of the people in america don't think it's going to be okay for their kids that they'll never meet the standard of living they had over the last few weeks i've laid out my build back better plan based on necessities and on the idea we can't just build back to what it was before we have to build back better this time bring everybody along we need to make bold practical investments to recover from the economic mess we're in and to rebuild the economic future our country deserves i've explained how these investments be paid for i've laid it out today i'm here to explain how the buildback better plan will deal with systemic racism and advance racial equity in our economy so far the buildback better plan has had three parts i've spoken to first investing in american manufacturing and technology so the future is made in america and it includes all americans not just the seven cities the vast majority of venture gone do under my plan we will mobilize the biggest investment in rebuilding our country since world war ii creating millions of good paying union jobs it includes a historic investment in federal procurement which is the way government purchases goods and services under my proposal we'd make sure those goods and services are american-made and american supply chains like american steel for building an energy efficient vehicles and battery technology and so on but for too long federal contracting for this work has been inaccessible to too many black and brown entrepreneurs and businesses they too often never get a fair shot to apply my plan makes sure that contractors and subcontractors of color get a fair shot we're going to triple the existing federal goal for contracting with small disadvantaged businesses from 5 percent to a minimum of 15 percent by 2025 will create jobs and growth along the way we can do that the second plan can build back better advances racial equity by mobilizing our infrastructure and taking on climate change with jobs take infrastructure for example in too many underserved communities of color the roads are falling apart street lights are out sidewalks are cracked school buildings outdated and unsafe parks aren't safe for the kids to play in or adults to exercise in there's nowhere you can go to buy fresh food for a minute for miles away air pollution causes childhood asthma that follows them through their adult lives and affects their overall health condition abandon homes crush property values and diminish the quality of life in the neighborhoods they exist but notwithstanding these systematic barriers look at the energy pride and achievement of communities of color just imagine if we could truly unleash their full potential my buildback better plan would make sure families in these communities are the ones who benefit from the hundreds of billions of dollars in federal investment taxpayer dollars that have already have to be invested by the administration in purchasing things to rebuild roads fill those cracks in the sidewalks and still broadband close the digital divide create spaces to live and work and play safely where you can drink clean water breathe clean air and shop at a nearby grocery store with a fresh stock of healthy food we can't rebuild our economy and meet this climate crisis unless we create opportunities for people to build their own communities this is about jobs it's also about dignity it's about pride i'm confident we can do this the third plank might build back better investment is in caregivers who take care of our loved ones and our kids if we truly want to reward the work in this country we have to ease the financial burdens of care that families are carrying we have to elevate the compassion benefits and dignity of caregiver workers and early childhood educators families are squeezed emotionally and financially trying to raise their kids and care for their parents or loved ones living with a disability my guess is some of you been through that with a parent who's ill and can't take care of themselves you have to make the choice of going to work or staying home and take care of them because the cost is so incredible or a young child under the age of five figuring how you pay for it i was a single parent for five years a lot of help and i had a good salary i was making 42 000 a year without my family i couldn't have done it they need help but often they can't afford it and the professional caregivers out there home health workers child care workers who are often women women of color and immigrants are too often underpaid undersea and undervalued but these are things we can do right now to ease the burden my plan would clear the waiting list that exists now of 800 000 people who are eligible for home and community care for a loved one through medicaid who signed up but are waiting eight hundred thousand my plan would make sure every three and four-year-old child gets access to free high quality preschool like students have at this center what i do with title one schools and low middle income families won't spend more than seven percent of their income on child care for children under the age of five the most hard-pressed working families won't have to spend a dime because they'll be free my pam would pay and support our caregivers who overwhelmingly as i said are women of color this plan to help workers especially those without college degrees gain new skills in good paying industries like healthcare and provides a pathway to advance their careers for example a home health care worker under this plan will have access to training you need to become an emt or a nurse or physician's assistant we don't just put millions of americans to work in new care and elderly and early childhood education jobs will also free up millions more to rejoin the paid workforce studies indicate at least two million additional jobs will be created in more economic growth for our nation and the economy as a whole will grow we can do this today i'm laying out a fourth part of my build back better plan advancing racial equity across american economy not just part of the other pillar of bill back better but this is in its own right to start we create a new small business opportunity fund it dramatically expands on the successful obama biden initiative that generated more than five billion in five dollars in private equity for every one dollar in public investment in a small business particularly in hard-pressed areas we're going to make take 30 billion dollars of our made in america investment i announced earlier this year and put it into this fund it will allow the expanded federal support for the most effective state local and non-profit programs to provide venture capital and financing for minority business owners and communities in need it will also allow us to support community development banks that have a proven record of investing in minority small businesses that 30 billion is estimated to leverage 150 billion in new financing and equity for more black and brown small businesses so our small business opportunity fund supports an investment in a small manufacturer of color seeking to commercialize a new technology for example that helps the manufacturer get started then private investors we know notice the promise of that business and invest their private dollars as well that helps manufacturers scale and grow that's how we'll make sure those are the best ideas are not denied the venture capital or financing they need because of race or zip code and here's why it matters right now we're in the midst of one of the greatest threats to small businesses our country has ever seen what donald trump doing about it well he's given big banks the green light to loan millions of dollars that they're covered for by the federal government and make millions of dollars in fees by favoring their most well-off and well-connected clients while shutting the door on smaller black and brown business without these connections you all remember some of you covered when i first laid out what i thought needed to be done in the first recovery plan put forward by the congress i said we should use the president should use the authority he has under the defense production act to force big banks to have to lend to small businesses they're guaranteed the loan we bailed them out before forced them to land but what did they do do you have a credit card with us have you established credit with us do you have a bank account with us doing a good list goes on and they're denied the result billions of dollars in covert relief programs for small businesses benefit ones who had lawyers and accountants to help them better connect to businesses jumped at the head of the line and the big banks accommodated black and brown small businesses that needed to help most got shut out in fact just 12 percent 12 percent of black and brown businesses surveyed seeking help got the aid they asked for now half of them say they're going to have to close up shop and they're a major source of employment in america our economy can't afford for them to close their families can't afford for them to close under my plan 50 percent of emergency small business relief would be reserved for the smallest businesses of 50 or fewer employers right now we're talking 500 they are small business compared to the fortune 500 but do you think most people think the neighborhood stores have 500 employees in a small business ride down the main streets of so many small towns around america and big towns and see them shuttered this would help minority-owned business get life-saving loans before the well-connected businesses jump to the head of the line but removing the barriers for black and brown entrepreneurs to start and grow businesses there's only one of many things we have to do to close the racial wealth gap in this nation expanding black and brown home ownership is another today american cities there are a number where about 75 percent of white americans own their homes only 25 percent of black and brown citizens or black sessions own their homes even in the middle class communities of color the same homes that exist in the white community are often valued significantly less those black residents then see their wealth accumulate much more slowly many of you are from families like mine middle-class families where do we accumulate where did my parents accumulate any ability to borrow and generate any wealth in their home that's how it got built that's how a lot of us are able to send our kids to school to borrow against that when a house is an asset that helps build equity and wealth the homeownership disparity denies equal opportunity my housing plan is going to be maximum employment and stable prices under my plan i believe the fed should add that risk to that responsibility and aggressively target persistent racial gaps in jobs wages and wealth revise its hiring and employment practices and achieve greater diversity at all levels of that institution including diverse nominees for the board of governors and the regional federal banks so the chairman of the federal reserve provides a report on the health of our economy we'll know if the economy is helping everybody that's when racial equity is not just an aspiration but a theory of change how to build our economic future to include everyone to include all those remarkable people out there doing extraordinary things given just half a chance i met a couple they're in here somewhere markivis where are you see that young man right there i hope i might embarrass you and his lovely wife markiva so i just met backstage his mom and dad never went to college and he was 12 when someone gave him so someone gave him hand him an old laptop computer he took it apart put it back together it changed his life at 17 he got certified to become an i.t systems specialist he went to college studied abroad came back home seen the digital divide in his community and he started a business getting computers to folks he's now 22 married a little baby and expecting another and he has seven employees his goal is to teach people how to repair and recycle computers and create a workforce development program to get them trained for good paying i.t jobs pretty incredible he's incredible some of the people he helped only had eighth grade educations never used a computer before five weeks later they know how some are now earning 15 an hour for their first job and for the first time they're incredible he wants to scale up this business and continue to reinvesting in his community that's pure courage heart and gut he never gives up the pursuit of a full promise american that's who we are that's what this election is all about we are america we don't settle we aspire and we succeed i'll be happy to take your questions let me get my list here okay jessica mr vice president i want to talk a little bit about your vp pick we're narrowing in on the time frame that you had identified as when you would make your announcement are you still targeting early august and how many of these people how many finalists do you have into you are you going to be able to meet with them in person because of coven i'm going to try to figure out how to trick you all so i can meet with them in person you got crews outside my house i don't think it matters actually what i said was that i will i'm going to have a choice in the first week in august and i promise i'll let you know when i do but will you get to meet with them in person do you think will i what i'm sorry will you be able to meet with them face to face well we'll see you're gonna have to wear masks they will have to wear masks will you get tested do you think if you have to do that for covid i'm not prepared to say much more than that right okay thank you all right i'm supposed to call on people right okay mary bruce abc thank you mr vice president this pandemic is taking a terrible toll on american lives and also the economy but are there specific states right now that you think should halt their reopenings and roll things back and if so which states well i i'm not going to comment in every state but any state where the rate is more than one to one here should be in fact rolling back look from the beginning of my view the president has had given us a false choice he said that we have to get back to work and also deal with covet you can't get this country going again unless you get coveted under control and so he has been really late in the game to getting around himself wearing a mask for example we waited for he as you've heard it a hundred times the columbia studies showing that if he'd acted just one week earlier it would be i think it was 37 000 was it 31 000 more people alive two weeks earlier 57 000 or whatever the point is that there's no clear message there's a federal responsibility to lay out really clear guidelines it's like opening up our schools what's happening now is there's a national we need the cdc they had very strict guidelines they were going to do it first they've watered those down in my view what i've seen is talking the docs that i deal with about three times a week and given an hour and a half an hour 50 minute brief and uh and so i think that what's happening now is even in the states where it's about you know freedom freedom versus uh physical safety of your neighbor and and communication of the virus even in those states they're now locking down and they're locking down counties which have high returns on testing the president says his answer was we'll stop testing so we're not going to know okay we won't know who's who has the virus i think it's really important and here it takes me into what the next stage of this is as you know i know you covered this a lot i called a long time ago meaning several months that we should be putting together right now and we should be providing about 25 billion dollars to do it to make sure that we have a detailed plan once a vaccine is in fact found god willing sooner than later to be able to be distributed to all america and anything beyond that and it's really a difficult logistical thing to do where's the planning to do that we said the same thing about testing and tracing we still don't have enough tests we still not have the capacity to trace and so it really really i pray the president in fact takes advantage of the prospect of getting a vaccine near just before just after the first of the year so we're able to distribute it and do it in a way that deals with every part of america but there's been no planning that i can see and to be clear have you been tested yet no i have not thank you thank you all right greg anderson delaware state news uh you've had these meetings in dover the last or delaware the last three weeks i'm just curious why delaware to be here making these announcements because i'm home this is my home and this is uh making this announcement in terms of whether i did this announcement in in seattle washington or in you know new mexico wouldn't matter she gets the same coverage no matter where it is and it was just a lot easier to be able to communicate with staff work with staff that's in philadelphia and the like to get this all lined up and and what i found is operating out of home all the stuff about hiding in the basement well over 340 million people have watched what we've done like this on television that's as big as the american population so i'm learning that it doesn't the way people are viewing the news and absorbing the news these days is totally different than it was before so i find it really doesn't make a whole lot of difference where you do it from as long as we can do it safely and i secondly the reason i want to do this is because of hicks anderson i can think of no more if i were in washington at the time i'd come here for dealing with this issue because of my buddy hicks and what has been done and what he was all about it's just as a delaware thing as you probably know thank you thank you okay mike thank you sir you just said that you believe that the president is intentionally provoking some of these violent clashes we're seeing particularly in portland but as you might know the president you turn your mic down a little bit so i can hear you better i'm sorry it helps to be a little taller i suppose no no i didn't mean that you just said that you believe the president is intentionally provoking some of the violence we've seen in these clashes in portland specifically but as you might know the president in his tweets and his campaign and the television ads they're running is warning that if you're president we would see similar scenes throughout the country i wonder how you would respond to that and if you were president right now what specifically would you be doing to strike the balance between the right to peaceably assemble but mitigating the kinds of violence and the damage to public property that we're seeing i'd be using local police as we did when we were in office when there were riots in our federal property at stake we were able to take care of that we're able to take care of it by the use of not what as wide as this obviously the use of of local police and the fact is that arsonists should be held accountable people carrying guns shooting should be held accountable people who engage in criminal activity should and must be held accountable and taken to trial but what's happened here is this has just caused such enormous political division and it's all about being able to you see some of the ads you know you see cities burning call biden is you know and they have my picture in the background you know and if if it's a rape dial one of the boom as anything else it's going to take seven days i mean come on that is all about trying to come up with a bizarre law and order 2020 campaign thing to try to scare the devil out of the american people and what's happened is it as look mike um when the president decided he had to walk across from the white house to a group of peaceful demonstrators to an episcopal church to hold a bible upside down which i don't know how often he reads and he used the military to do that did you ever think you'd see a chairman of the joint chiefs of staff apologizing to the nation for participating in that did you ever see you think you'd see four former chiefs of staff talk about how everything is about dividing the country that wasn't about being able to walk across and hold up the bible that wasn't about the church burning or being burned it was about as his own people said his own own commander it was about to dividing the country preying on when you have a president who in the almost the same day the state of mississippi takes the confederate flag off of their flag and he's defending the confederate flag it's just a matter of heritage and why is it still being flown or something to that effect at nascar and why things are down this is about division this is about trying to split the country and so far thank god the american people aren't having any of it over 70 percent of the people in the country thinking the protesters that that you ever think you see 77 people saying black lives matter because they see what happens and they're not buying onto this racial division that's what he's done from the very beginning as you've heard me say coming down an escalator today now says you're going to get rid of those mexican rapists and judges i mean this is so mike i don't think you need to do that but i think we do need to hold those who violate the law accountable you should never let what's done in a march for equal rights overcome what the reason for the march is and that's what these folks are doing and they should be arrested found arrested and tried and sir if i can as you finish the roll out of your economic plan during the course of the primaries you were critical of some of your democratic opponents for putting forward plans that you thought were too expensive and not realistic in terms of getting passed i wonder if you can you're now proposing nearly three trillion dollars as part of this and spending as part of this economic plan can you describe your evolution in terms of what you view as achievable if you're elected and sworn in as president i think there's a big difference between saying figuratively speaking no one can be a millionaire it's a bad thing saying that we are going to provide a medical plan that costs 30 trillion dollars or 32 trillion dollars and being able to get it passed and being able to pass in this environment legislation that the circumstances have demonstrated is needed to solve real problems for example the idea that we can continue to be in a circumstance where we reward companies for government contractors for going overseas to make their products that we can continue to provide tax breaks for that effort when we find we come up short with everything from reagents or nasal swabs to not being able to provide for the kinds of steel we need to do certain things in american ships and the like is is is is totally different than that what we're going to what we're talking about is using federal dollars that have already been appropriated to focus them on building things that make us and increase our independence so we don't have to rely on anyone else for whether it's cyber security and cyber information or whether or not it is steel to make the banisters on on our destroyers we in fact should be able to do that those things that are necessary that we have the capacity to do at home do them at home it's not industrial planning it's the things that only the united states government can do for example the same thing with regard to the whole my whole plan relative to the environment we in fact can or the only outfit companies aren't going to come along and go spend a trillion dollars on infrastructure rebuild highways bridges that are causing people to die when they collapse and and they're still unsafe making sure ports are are accessible and ships can get in and out and unload their cargo it's less the government does that and when the government does that the government should be in fact insisting that using that taxpayer dollar we are buying the product from an american manufacturer made in america employing american workers getting a decent wage and that's that's not industrial policy it's the things the government does anyway it's like you've heard me say before the president united states and i'm president i'm gonna inherit the largest auto and truck fleet in the world owned by the taxpayers well what do you think we should do well i think we should be doing is making sure we end up owning the electrical vehicle market so what i'm going to do is move move to make sure all those vehicles become carbon neutral building 550 000 charging stations up and down federally built highways and controlled highways generating the kind of growth union wages that can provide good jobs for people and bring everybody along so it is very different than saying we're going to go out and find another 38 trillion dollars and get that passed in a congress where you didn't have the support to get it i predict you'll find that i get significant support particularly if i think is going to happen i think we're going to take back the united states senate and again we're just spending the dollars that are already appropriated in many cases and how we spend them thank you sir okay ed o'keefe cbs thank you sir um i'll take this off you alluded to this in in your remarks and i bring it up because polling is bearing this out a little bit but are you running against president trump or for president and for joe biden in other words you alluded to this but a lot of voters seem to think or saying that their support hinges on the fact that you're not the president so why perhaps should they be voting for you and not just against the president that's why i'm laying out these detailed plans look uh i'm running because trump is the president and i think our democracy is at stake for real and what seems to be the case is many americans those who don't like me and those who do view me as the antithesis of trump and i believe that i am and i when i announced i said i was running because i thought it was essential to restore basic decency the soul of america but i really meant it it wasn't you know remember i got criticized early on for saying that now everybody's talking about the soul america decency honor respect the second reason i said i was running is because even back when people were talking about how well the economy was moving i thought the middle class was still getting crushed and working class folks were hurting badly all this talk about how happy they were i didn't see any numbers showing they were so happy because people were getting paid badly they were being corporate america was overreaching in terms of who they felt they had an obligation to deal with at all and thirdly the thing i got most criticized for and understandably was i said we have to unite america and they said well that's just a pipe dream you used to be able to do that joe but everything's changed well if we can't unite america we're gone we're dead democracy is dead it requires consensus i'm not that's not hyperbole it requires consensus and that's why i used to be sometimes critical when people stand in the debates they say i'm going to buy executive order do the following well that's trump he doesn't have the authority to do half of what he's doing by executive order that is not democracy and so what i hope the good news i think is the bad news based on all the million polls have been done by your network and everybody else is the good news is the bad news people know me they know me warts and all and the reason why i'm running because i think i have two qualities at this moment that aren't always the most relevant qualities needed in the president it changes everything is every election is different one is that i know a fair amount about american foreign policy and i have relations all over the world and those who don't like me respect me and those who do like me respect me i know how to get things done internationally doesn't mean i can solve a problem but i am i understand the national security and intelligence issues that's what i've done my whole life trump has no notion of it none think of how he talks about putin my god and he talks to him privately and says he's not didn't he's not going to tell you whether he raised the fact that putin's paying the taliban number one number two i have been relatively good at bringing people together in the united states congress and politically it's going to be a lot harder things have changed a lot harder but depending on the outcome of the election in terms of the senate race house races it could become very much within reach because i'll say it again i've never questioned anybody's motive i've never lied to a political opponent and misled them even when i was in the senate i'd say you i need your vote on this but i got to tell you vote for it this part of your constituency is going to be mad at you i've never misled anybody i don't expect anybody to voluntarily agree agree to be in the second editions of profiles and courage i try to recognize the limits of where they can go and still find a principal compromise and so they're the two things that i think we very badly need now and lastly i think that notwithstanding the fact i think i have laid out the most detailed plans on the economy and on issues relating to health care and the rest of any president of modern history i mean it's awful detail if if i'm elected this passes i'm going to be going to go down as almost progressive presidents in american history but none of the things i'm talking about are inconsistent with a free market they're not inconsistent with capitalism but they require certain safeguards just like you know that whole thing you know it took uh it took a capitalist to save capitalism well you know i think there's a lot that we can get done and will get done and that's why last thing i'll say remember i was criticized by saying i'm going to campaign in states for senators and house members or states that i'm not likely to be able to win because what everything shows and you know this inside out and backwards all of you do that when the national party doesn't invest in areas where there's a tight race it hurts the local officials up and down the list and so this is we got to build a bench here and that's what this is about as well so i'm hoping that people will take a look at what i've done what i'm proposing why it's in their interest that they move in the direction i'm suggesting and i think that is what we're seeing some response to i have a quick uh covet question in this regard the florida marlins today announced they had to suspend their season be curious because i know you get briefings on how kovid should be dealt with and how society should be importing itself in the midst of all this what do you make of how sports leagues uh are starting to play again and frankly for that matter what do you make of how schools are considering all this president's considering or has said he would withhold federal funding from states or school districts that don't reopen or that yeah that don't reopen i mean you must have thoughts on all this i do i've laid out an interest time i've laid out we'll get you a copy of my school reopening plan what i think is required in order to do that there's some circumstances you can do that but you have to make significant investments to do that in order to provide for protective gear in order to provide for social distancing in order to have testing and tracing and all those things it's possible but it's it's a significant investment and it requires the certainty that teachers as well as students are going to be protected and where you're in a high intensity area where there's a lot of covet it is not a good idea evidence the fact that due rhetorical question i'm not expecting you to answer it do you think the president all of a sudden decided not to go to tallahassee because he no longer he thought it was the interest of the public he's decided for jacksonville i mean jacksonville florida i'm thinking of the capitol to go to florida to jacksonville well because even the republicans down there said we don't want you doing this we don't want you doing this they're just it's a mistake and so i think that it there are guidelines that have to be much made much more specific by the cdc they should let the scientists speak let the scientists speak i'm happy the president is back holding his uh his uh conferences on kova every day i don't know what tell he's adding to it except it's good he's wearing a mask and saying the right things mostly but this is about science this is about science this is about expertise this is about transparency and we've got to make it available to the american people because what everybody's finding out all end with is it is that the circumstance is such that even when even when the business is opened people aren't showing up because they don't think it's safe in many and so there ought to be a system whereby and which i propose that you can lay out the details of what you're doing in your business and be able to put a sign out that says it's safe i've met all the standards but the idea that we're just going to say open up and people are going to show up they're not they're not should there be sports right now though should major league baseball go well it seems to me that it's probably not going to be able to happen based on based on what the leagues themselves are saying i mean you have the marlins saying we can't do it so many people so i think they should just follow the science the one thing that seems to work a little bit i don't know is basketball where no one's traveling they're all sequestered in one place it's like look many of you have all of you have families moms dads etc if they come from another state you go from your from wherever you are to their state well you should be quarantining before you go see them up to 12 days think about it the united states of america you can't travel to a whole hell of a lot of european countries you can't get in a plane and go there don't come you're a danger to us it's because we're not following the science and there's very little transparency of what's going on but i have confidence at the end of the day out of so when you you know when you have a lot of ball for football players turning down eight ten million bucks a year and say i'm not gonna take the risk of playing you gotta listen you gotta listen so i'm not gonna opine on every sport but it seems to me that when you have to travel when you have to be in hotel rooms or places that are different than you've been the day before when you are in a position where you walk going into an area where there is a high concentration of the spread of covet all those things add up to a real problem and i don't and we're not going to really overcome that until we follow the science and get a vaccine but i want to say it again i'm going to keep saying it the president as we speak should be starting and should have started three months ago to put someone in charge of how specifically like waging a war how are you going to distribute the vaccine when it arrives when it arrives when it's there and the question of whether it's real when it's there that requires enormous transparency you've got to make all of it available to other experts across the nation so they can look and see so there's consensus this is a safe vaccine because already you have what percentage the american people saying if the vaccine were there tomorrow they wouldn't take it and it's not the usual anti-vaccine crowd it's beyond that because people are losing faith in what the president says think about it what the words of a president matter significantly they can as i said before take us to war they can bring peace they can rise to cause the market to rise they can do good things but people listen to what a president says and if a president repeatedly says things to you that are not true and then there comes a time when they say i have something that i think can cure you but it could really hurt you you're not going to listen to the guy who says been lying to you in the long run anyway thank you so much appreciate the time and i'm getting out of here thank you all right you,b good afternoon everyone welcome to kingswood community center actually that be the one down i use to work as a joke PRON know where PRON be anyway PRON be uh PRON be PRON be great to be here and uh back uh a place where uh PRON know uh i want to thank wayne jefferson for uh have

PRON pass especially for many of PRON republican friend back PRON be some action protect that sacred right to vote that PRON be willing to die for if PRON do not PRON have be say all along PRON be one of the first thing PRON will do as president if elect PRON can not let the fundamental right to vote be deny especially in the middle as this pandemic rage on nearly dead from cover and count more than four million americans have test positive and county black and latinos be three time as likely to be infect and twice as likely to die from the virus as white people more than million and counting be collect unemployment check black unemployment be at percent latino of black own business in total have report PRON have to shut down and everything be bad be bad than by this crisis of presidential leadership to change the tone over the last few day as trump have do not change the fact of the last four year donald trump face a real test and PRON be fail PRON the basic threshold of be president the duty to care for the entire country not just as re election prospect PRON be show that PRON can not beat the pandemic and keep PRON safe PRON can not turn the economy around and get america back to work and PRON be horrifyingly and not surprisingly intentionally stoke the flame of division and racism in this country PRON have say from the outset of the recent protest that there be no place for violence or destruction of property peaceful protester should be protect and arsonist and anarchist should be prosecute and local law enforcement can do that when president obama and i be in office PRON protect federal property PRON be able to do PRON without the department of homeland security turn PRON into a private militia and PRON could be do today but that would not help trump political interest PRON be determine to stoke division and chaos PRON be not good for the country but donald trump do not care PRON campaign be fail and PRON be look for a political lifeline this be not about law and order PRON be about a political strategy to revive a fail campaign every instinct trump have be to add fuel to the fire PRON be the last thing the last thing PRON need PRON need leadership PRON will calm the water and lower the temperature that be how PRON will restore peace in the street but this election be not just about vote against donald trump PRON be about rise to this moment of crisis understanding people trouble struggle and build a future worthy of PRON courage and PRON ambition to overcome last month i stop at bethel amy church here in wilmington not far from here i talk to a group of faith and local leader PRON share PRON pain PRON anger and the frustration at the state of affair state affair in PRON justice system PRON health care system PRON politic PRON economy there be just a sense and PRON be real that the deck be stack stack against the community the common theme be how do PRON break the cycle in good time community of color still lag in bad time PRON get hit first and the hard and in recovery PRON take the long to bounce back this be about justice i propose a criminal justice reform a policing reform agenda that PRON be committed to work with the congress to see PRON through as president PRON be also about job good pay job financial stability building wealth for family of cover of color and pass PRON down to PRON kid PRON be about economic growth for PRON country and outperform the rest of the world to stay ahead PRON be also about dignity for work people and the middle class many of PRON hear PRON say PRON before PRON dad have an expression PRON say joey a job be about a lot more than a paycheck PRON be about PRON dignity PRON be about respect PRON be about PRON place in the community and by say PRON be about be able to look PRON kid in the eye and say honey PRON be go to be okay and mean PRON over fifty percent of the people in america do not think PRON be go to be okay for PRON kid that PRON will never meet the standard of living PRON have over the last few week PRON have lay out PRON build back well plan base on necessity and on the idea PRON can not just build back to what PRON be before PRON have to build back better this time bring everybody along PRON need to make bold practical investment to recover from the economic mess PRON be in and to rebuild the economic future PRON country deserve PRON have explain how these investment be pay for PRON have lay PRON out today PRON be here to explain how the buildback well plan will deal with systemic racism and advance racial equity in PRON economy so far the buildback well plan have have three part PRON have speak to first investing in american manufacturing and technology so the future be make in america and PRON include all americans not just the seven city the vast majority of venture go do under PRON plan PRON will mobilize the big investment in rebuild PRON country since world war ii create million of good pay union job PRON include a historic investment in federal procurement which be the way government purchase good and service under PRON proposal PRON would make sure those good and service be american make and american supply chain like american steel for build an energy efficient vehicle and battery technology and so on but for too long federal contracting for this work have be inaccessible to too many black and brown entrepreneur and business PRON too often never get a fair shot to apply PRON plan make sure that contractor and subcontractor of color get a fair shot PRON be go to triple the exist federal goal for contracting with small disadvantaged business from percent to a minimum of percent by will create job and growth along the way PRON can do that the second plan can build back well advance racial equity by mobilize PRON infrastructure and take on climate change with job take infrastructure for example in too many underserved community of color the road be fall apart street light be out sidewalk be crack school building outdate and unsafe park be not safe for the kid to play in or adult to exercise in there be nowhere PRON can go to buy fresh food for a minute for mile away air pollution cause childhood asthma that follow PRON through PRON adult life and affect PRON overall health condition abandon home crush property value and diminish the quality of life in the neighborhood PRON exist but notwithstanding these systematic barrier look at the energy pride and achievement of community of color just imagine if PRON could truly unleash PRON full potential PRON buildback well plan would make sure family in these community be the one who benefit from the hundred of billion of dollar in federal investment taxpayer dollar that have already have to be invest by the administration in purchase thing to rebuild road fill those crack in the sidewalk and still broadband close the digital divide create space to live and work and play safely where PRON can drink clean water breathe clean air and shop at a nearby grocery store with a fresh stock of healthy food PRON can not rebuild PRON economy and meet this climate crisis unless PRON create opportunity for people to build PRON own community this be about job PRON be also about dignity PRON be about pride PRON be confident PRON can do this the third plank may build back well investment be in caregiver who take care of PRON love one and PRON kid if PRON truly want to reward the work in this country PRON have to ease the financial burden of care that family be carry PRON have to elevate the compassion benefit and dignity of caregiver worker and early childhood educator family be squeeze emotionally and financially try to raise PRON kid and care for PRON parent or love one live with a disability PRON guess be some of PRON be through that with a parent who be ill and can not take care of PRON PRON have to make the choice of go to work or stay home and take care of PRON because the cost be so incredible or a young child under the age of five figure how PRON pay for PRON i be a single parent for five year a lot of help and i have a good salary i be make a year without PRON family i could not have do PRON PRON need help but often PRON can not afford PRON and the professional caregiver out there home health worker child care worker who be often woman woman of color and immigrant be too often underpaid undersea and undervalue but these be thing PRON can do right now to ease the burden PRON plan would clear the waiting list that exist now of people who be eligible for home and community care for a loved one through medicaid who sign up but be wait eight hundred thousand PRON plan would make sure every three and four year old child get access to free high quality preschool like student have at this center what i do with title one school and low middle income family will not spend more than seven percent of PRON income on child care for child under the age of five the most hard press work family will not have to spend a dime because PRON will be free PRON pam would pay and support PRON caregiver who overwhelmingly as i say be woman of color this plan to help worker especially those without college degree gain new skill in good pay industry like healthcare and provide a pathway to advance PRON career for example a home health care worker under this plan will have access to training PRON need to become an emt or a nurse or physician assistant PRON do not just put million of americans to work in new care and elderly and early childhood education job will also free up million more to rejoin the pay workforce study indicate at least two million additional job will be create in more economic growth for PRON nation and the economy as a whole will grow PRON can do this today PRON be lay out a fourth part of PRON build back well plan advance racial equity across american economy not just part of the other pillar of bill back better but this be in PRON own right to start PRON create a new small business opportunity fund PRON dramatically expand on the successful obama biden initiative that generate more than five billion in five dollar in private equity for every one dollar in public investment in a small business particularly in hard press area PRON be go to make take billion dollar of PRON make in america investment i announce earlier this year and put PRON into this fund PRON will allow the expand federal support for the most effective state local and non profit program to provide venture capital and financing for minority business owner and community in need PRON will also allow PRON to support community development bank that have a prove record of invest in minority small business that billion be estimate to leverage billion in new financing and equity for more black and brown small business so PRON small business opportunity fund support an investment in a small manufacturer of color seek to commercialize a new technology for example that help the manufacturer get start then private investor PRON know notice the promise of that business and invest PRON private dollar as well that help manufacturer scale and grow that be how PRON will make sure those be the good idea be not deny the venture capital or financing PRON need because of race or zip code and here be why PRON matter right now PRON be in the midst of one of the great threat to small business PRON country have ever see what donald trump do about PRON well PRON be give big bank the green light to loan million of dollar that PRON be cover for by the federal government and make million of dollar in fee by favor PRON most well off and well connect client while shut the door on small black and brown business without these connection PRON all remember some of PRON cover when i first lay out what i think need to be do in the first recovery plan put forward by the congress i say PRON should use the president should use the authority PRON have under the defense production act to force big bank to have to lend to small business PRON be guarantee the loan PRON bail PRON out before force PRON to land but what do PRON do do PRON have a credit card with PRON have PRON establish credit with PRON do PRON have a bank account with PRON do a good list go on and PRON be deny the result billion of dollar in covert relief program for small business benefit one who have lawyer and accountant to help PRON better connect to business jump at the head of the line and the big bank accommodate black and brown small business that need to help most get shut out in fact just percent percent of black and brown business survey seek help get the aid PRON ask for now half of PRON say PRON be go to have to close up shop and PRON be a major source of employment in america PRON economy can not afford for PRON to close PRON family can not afford for PRON to close under PRON plan percent of emergency small business relief would be reserve for the small business of or few employer right now PRON be talk PRON be small business compare to the fortune but do PRON think most people think the neighborhood store have employee in a small business ride down the main street of so many small town around america and big town and see PRON shutter this would help minority own business get life save loan before the well connect business jump to the head of the line but remove the barrier for black and brown entrepreneur to start and grow business there be only one of many thing PRON have to do to close the racial wealth gap in this nation expand black and brown home ownership be another today american city there be a number where about percent of white americans own PRON home only percent of black and brown citizen or black session own PRON home even in the middle class community of color the same home that exist in the white community be often value significantly less those black resident then see PRON wealth accumulate much more slowly many of PRON be from family like mine middle class family where do PRON accumulate where do PRON parent accumulate any ability to borrow and generate any wealth in PRON home that be how PRON get build that be how a lot of PRON be able to send PRON kid to school to borrow against that when a house be an asset that help build equity and wealth the homeownership disparity deny equal opportunity PRON housing plan be go to be maximum employment and stable price under PRON plan i believe the fed should add that risk to that responsibility and aggressively target persistent racial gap in job wage and wealth revise PRON hiring and employment practice and achieve great diversity at all level of that institution include diverse nominee for the board of governors and the regional federal bank so the chairman of the federal reserve provide a report on the health of PRON economy PRON will know if the economy be help everybody that be when racial equity be not just an aspiration but a theory of change how to build PRON economic future to include everyone to include all those remarkable people out there do extraordinary thing give just half a chance i meet a couple PRON be in here somewhere markivi where be PRON see that young man right there i hope i may embarrass PRON and PRON lovely wife markiva so i just meet backstage PRON mom and dad never go to college and PRON be when someone give PRON so someone give PRON hand PRON an old laptop computer PRON take PRON apart put PRON back together PRON change PRON life at PRON get certify to become an i t system specialist PRON go to college study abroad come back home see the digital divide in PRON community and PRON start a business get computer to folk PRON be now marry a little baby and expect another and PRON have seven employee PRON goal be to teach people how to repair and recycle computer and create a workforce development program to get PRON train for good pay i t job pretty incredible PRON be incredible some of the people PRON help only have eighth grade education never use a computer before five week later PRON know how some be now earn an hour for PRON first job and for the first time PRON be incredible PRON want to scale up this business and continue to reinveste in PRON community that be pure courage heart and gut PRON never give up the pursuit of a full promise american that be who PRON be that be what this election be all about PRON be america PRON do not settle PRON aspire and PRON succeed PRON will be happy to take PRON question let PRON get PRON list here okay jessica mr vice president i want to talk a little bit about PRON vp pick PRON be narrow in on the time frame that PRON have identify as when PRON would make PRON announcement be PRON still target early august and how many of these people how many finalist do PRON have into PRON be PRON go to be able to meet with PRON in person because of coven PRON be go to try to figure out how to trick PRON all so i can meet with PRON in person PRON get crew outside PRON house i do not think PRON matter actually what i say be that i will PRON be go to have a choice in the first week in august and i promise PRON will let PRON know when i do but will PRON get to meet with PRON in person do PRON think will i what PRON be sorry will PRON be able to meet with PRON face to face well PRON will see PRON be go to have to wear mask PRON will have to wear mask will PRON get test do PRON think if PRON have to do that for covid PRON be not prepared to say much more than that right okay thank PRON all right PRON be suppose to call on people right okay mary bruce abc thank PRON mr vice president this pandemic be take a terrible toll on american life and also the economy but be there specific state right now that PRON think should halt PRON reopening and roll thing back and if so which state well i PRON be not go to comment in every state but any state where the rate be more than one to one here should be in fact roll back look from the beginning of PRON view the president have have give PRON a false choice PRON say that PRON have to get back to work and also deal with covet PRON can not get this country go again unless PRON get covet under control and so PRON have be really late in the game to get around PRON wear a mask for example PRON wait for PRON as PRON have hear PRON a hundred time the columbia study show that if PRON would act just one week earlier PRON would be i think PRON be be PRON more people alive two week early or whatever the point be that there be no clear message there be a federal responsibility to lay out really clear guideline PRON be like open up PRON school what be happen now be there be a national PRON need the cdc PRON have very strict guideline PRON be go to do PRON first PRON have water those down in PRON view what PRON have see be talk the doc that i deal with about three time a week and give an hour and a half an hour minute brief and uh and so i think that what be happen now be even in the state where PRON be about PRON know freedom freedom versus uh physical safety of PRON neighbor and and communication of the virus even in those state PRON be now lock down and PRON be lock down county which have high return on test the president say PRON answer be PRON will stop test so PRON be not go to know okay PRON will not know who be who have the virus i think PRON be really important and here PRON take PRON into what the next stage of this be as PRON know i know PRON cover this a lot i call a long time ago mean several month that PRON should be put together right now and PRON should be provide about billion dollar to do PRON to make sure that PRON have a detailed plan once a vaccine be in fact find god willing sooner than later to be able to be distribute to all america and anything beyond that and PRON be really a difficult logistical thing to do where be the planning to do that PRON say the same thing about testing and trace PRON still do not have enough test PRON still not have the capacity to trace and so PRON really really i pray the president in fact take advantage of the prospect of get a vaccine near just before just after the first of the year so PRON be able to distribute PRON and do PRON in a way that deal with every part of america but there be be no planning that i can see and to be clear have PRON be test yet no i have not thank PRON thank PRON all right greg anderson delaware state news uh PRON have have these meeting in dover the last or delaware the last three week PRON be just curious why delaware to be here make these announcement because PRON be home this be PRON home and this be uh make this announcement in term of whether i do this announcement in in seattle washington or in PRON know new mexico would not matter PRON get the same coverage no matter where PRON be and PRON be just a lot easy to be able to communicate with staff work with staff that be in philadelphia and the like to get this all line up and and what i find be operate out of home all the stuff about hide in the basement well over million people have watch what PRON have do like this on television that be as big as the american population so PRON be learn that PRON do not the way people be view the news and absorb the news these day be totally different than PRON be before so i find PRON really do not make a whole lot of difference where PRON do PRON from as long as PRON can do PRON safely and i secondly the reason i want to do this be because of hicks anderson i can think of no more if i be in washington at the time PRON would come here for deal with this issue because of PRON buddy hick and what have be do and what PRON be all about PRON be just as a delaware thing as PRON probably know thank PRON thank PRON okay mike thank PRON sir PRON just say that PRON believe that the president be intentionally provoke some of these violent clash PRON be see particularly in portland but as PRON may know the president PRON turn PRON mic down a little bit so i can hear PRON well PRON be sorry PRON help to be a little tall i suppose no no i do not mean that PRON just say that PRON believe the president be intentionally provoke some of the violence PRON have see in these clash in portland specifically but as PRON may know the president in PRON tweet and PRON campaign and the television ad PRON be run be warn that if PRON be president PRON would see similar scene throughout the country i wonder how PRON would respond to that and if PRON be president right now what specifically would PRON be do to strike the balance between the right to peaceably assemble but mitigate the kind of violence and the damage to public property that PRON be see PRON would be use local police as PRON do when PRON be in office when there be riot in PRON federal property at stake PRON be able to take care of that PRON be able to take care of PRON by the use of not what as wide as this obviously the use of of local police and the fact be that arsonist should be hold accountable people carry gun shooting should be hold accountable people who engage in criminal activity should and must be hold accountable and take to trial but what be happen here be this have just cause such enormous political division and PRON be all about be able to PRON see some of the ad PRON know PRON see city burn call biden be PRON know and PRON have PRON picture in the background PRON know and if if PRON be a rape dial one of the boom as anything else PRON be go to take seven day i mean come on that be all about try to come up with a bizarre law and order campaign thing to try to scare the devil out of the american people and what be happen be PRON as look mike um when the president decide PRON have to walk across from the white house to a group of peaceful demonstrator to an episcopal church to hold a bible upside down which i do not know how often PRON read and PRON use the military to do that do PRON ever think PRON would see a chairman of the joint chiefs of staff apologize to the nation for participate in that do PRON ever see PRON think PRON would see four former chief of staff talk about how everything be about divide the country that be not about be able to walk across and hold up the bible that be not about the church burn or be burn PRON be about as PRON own people say PRON own own commander PRON be about to divide the country prey on when PRON have a president who in the almost the same day the state of mississippi take the confederate flag off of PRON flag and PRON be defend the confederate flag PRON be just a matter of heritage and why be PRON still be fly or something to that effect at nascar and why thing be down this be about division this be about try to split the country and so far thank god the american people be not have any of PRON over percent of the people in the country think the protester that that PRON ever think PRON see people say black life matter because PRON see what happen and PRON be not buy onto this racial division that be what PRON be do from the very beginning as PRON have hear PRON say come down an escalator today now say PRON be go to get rid of those mexican rapist and judge i mean this be so mike i do not think PRON need to do that but i think PRON do need to hold those who violate the law accountable PRON should never let what be do in a march for equal right overcome what the reason for the march be and that be what these folk be do and PRON should be arrest find arrest and try and sir if i can as PRON finish the roll out of PRON economic plan during the course of the primary PRON be critical of some of PRON democratic opponent for put forward plan that PRON think be too expensive and not realistic in term of get pass i wonder if PRON can PRON be now propose nearly three trillion dollar as part of this and spending as part of this economic plan can PRON describe PRON evolution in term of what PRON view as achievable if PRON be elect and swear in as president i think there be a big difference between say figuratively speak no one can be a millionaire PRON be a bad thing say that PRON be go to provide a medical plan that cost trillion dollar or trillion dollar and be able to get PRON pass and be able to pass in this environment legislation that the circumstance have demonstrate be need to solve real problem for example the idea that PRON can continue to be in a circumstance where PRON reward company for government contractor for go overseas to make PRON product that PRON can continue to provide tax break for that effort when PRON find PRON come up short with everything from reagent or nasal swab to not be able to provide for the kind of steel PRON need to do certain thing in american ship and the like be be be be totally different than that what PRON be go to what PRON be talk about be use federal dollar that have already be appropriate to focus PRON on build thing that make PRON and increase PRON independence so PRON do not have to rely on anyone else for whether PRON be cyber security and cyber information or whether or not PRON be steel to make the banister on on PRON destroyer PRON in fact should be able to do that those thing that be necessary that PRON have the capacity to do at home do PRON at home PRON be not industrial planning PRON be the thing that only the united states government can do for example the same thing with regard to the whole PRON whole plan relative to the environment PRON in fact can or the only outfit company be not go to come along and go spend a trillion dollar on infrastructure rebuild highway bridge that be cause people to die when PRON collapse and and PRON be still unsafe make sure port be be accessible and ship can get in and out and unload PRON cargo PRON be less the government do that and when the government do that the government should be in fact insist that use that taxpayer dollar PRON be buy the product from an american manufacturer make in america employ american worker get a decent wage and that be that be not industrial policy PRON be the thing the government do anyway PRON be like PRON have hear PRON say before the president united states and PRON be president PRON be go to inherit the large auto and truck fleet in the world own by the taxpayer well what do PRON think PRON should do well i think PRON should be do be make sure PRON end up own the electrical vehicle market so what PRON be go to do be move move to make sure all those vehicle become carbon neutral building charge station up and down federally build highway and control highway generate the kind of growth union wage that can provide good job for people and bring everybody along so PRON be very different than say PRON be go to go out and find another trillion dollar and get that pass in a congress where PRON do not have the support to get PRON i predict PRON will find that i get significant support particularly if i think be go to happen i think PRON be go to take back the united states senate and again PRON be just spend the dollar that be already appropriate in many case and how PRON spend PRON thank PRON sir okay ed o keefe cbs thank PRON sir um PRON will take this off PRON allude to this in in PRON remark and i bring PRON up because polling be bear this out a little bit but be PRON run against president trump or for president and for joe biden in other word PRON allude to this but a lot of voter seem to think or say that PRON support hinge on the fact that PRON be not the president so why perhaps should PRON be vote for PRON and not just against the president that be why PRON be lay out these detail plan look uh PRON be run because trump be the president and i think PRON democracy be at stake for real and what seem to be the case be many americans those who do not like PRON and those who do view PRON as the antithesis of trump and i believe that i be and i when i announce i say i be run because i think PRON be essential to restore basic decency the soul of america but i really mean PRON PRON be not PRON know remember i get criticize early on for say that now everybody be talk about the soul america decency honor respect the second reason i say i be run be because even back when people be talk about how well the economy be move i think the middle class be still get crush and work class folk be hurt badly all this talk about how happy PRON be i do not see any number show PRON be so happy because people be get pay badly PRON be be corporate america be overreach in term of who PRON feel PRON have an obligation to deal with at all and thirdly the thing i get most criticize for and understandably be i say PRON have to unite america and PRON say well that be just a pipe dream PRON use to be able to do that joe but everything be change well if PRON can not unite america PRON be go PRON be dead democracy be dead PRON require consensus PRON be not that be not hyperbole PRON require consensus and that be why i use to be sometimes critical when people stand in the debate PRON say PRON be go to buy executive order do the follow well that be trump PRON do not have the authority to do half of what PRON be do by executive order that be not democracy and so what i hope the good news i think be the bad news base on all the million poll have be do by PRON network and everybody else be the good news be the bad news people know PRON PRON know PRON wart and all and the reason why PRON be run because i think i have two quality at this moment that be not always the most relevant quality need in the president PRON change everything be every election be different one be that i know a fair amount about american foreign policy and i have relation all over the world and those who do not like PRON respect PRON and those who do like PRON respect PRON i know how to get thing do internationally do not mean i can solve a problem but i be i understand the national security and intelligence issue that be what PRON have do PRON whole life trump have no notion of PRON none think of how PRON talk about putin PRON god and PRON talk to PRON privately and say PRON be not do not PRON be not go to tell PRON whether PRON raise the fact that putin pay the taliban number one number two i have be relatively good at bring people together in the united states congress and politically PRON be go to be a lot hard thing have change a lot harder but depend on the outcome of the election in term of the senate race house race PRON could become very much within reach because PRON will say PRON again PRON have never question anybody motive PRON have never lie to a political opponent and mislead PRON even when i be in the senate PRON would say PRON i need PRON vote on this but i get to tell PRON vote for PRON this part of PRON constituency be go to be mad at PRON PRON have never mislead anybody i do not expect anybody to voluntarily agree agree to be in the second edition of profile and courage i try to recognize the limit of where PRON can go and still find a principal compromise and so PRON be the two thing that i think PRON very badly need now and lastly i think that notwithstanding the fact i think i have lay out the most detailed plan on the economy and on issue relate to health care and the rest of any president of modern history i mean PRON be awful detail if if PRON be elect this pass PRON be go to be go to go down as almost progressive president in american history but none of the thing PRON be talk about be inconsistent with a free market PRON be not inconsistent with capitalism but PRON require certain safeguard just like PRON know that whole thing PRON know PRON take uh PRON take a capitalist to save capitalism well PRON know i think there be a lot that PRON can get do and will get do and that be why last thing PRON will say remember i be criticize by say PRON be go to campaign in state for senator and house member or state that PRON be not likely to be able to win because what everything show and PRON know this inside out and backwards all of PRON do that when the national party do not invest in area where there be a tight race PRON hurt the local official up and down the list and so this be PRON get to build a bench here and that be what this be about as well so PRON be hope that people will take a look at what PRON have do what PRON be propose why PRON be in PRON interest that PRON move in the direction PRON be suggest and i think that be what PRON be see some response to i have a quick uh covet question in this regard the florida marlin today announce PRON have to suspend PRON season be curious because i know PRON get briefing on how kovid should be deal with and how society should be import PRON in the midst of all this what do PRON make of how sport league uh be start to play again and frankly for that matter what do PRON make of how school be consider all this president considering or have say PRON would withhold federal funding from state or school district that do not reopen or that yeah that do not reopen i mean PRON must have thought on all this i do PRON have lay out an interest time PRON have lay out PRON will get PRON a copy of PRON school reopen plan what i think be require in order to do that there be some circumstance PRON can do that but PRON have to make significant investment to do that in order to provide for protective gear in order to provide for social distancing in order to have testing and tracing and all those thing PRON be possible but PRON be PRON be a significant investment and PRON require the certainty that teacher as well as student be go to be protect and where PRON be in a high intensity area where there be a lot of covet PRON be not a good idea evidence the fact that due rhetorical question PRON be not expect PRON to answer PRON do PRON think the president all of a sudden decide not to go to tallahassee because PRON no longer PRON think PRON be the interest of the public PRON be decide for jacksonville i mean jacksonville florida PRON be think of the capitol to go to florida to jacksonville well because even the republicans down there say PRON do not want PRON do this PRON do not want PRON do this PRON be just PRON be a mistake and so i think that PRON there be guideline that have to be much make much more specific by the cdc PRON should let the scientist speak let the scientist speak PRON be happy the president be back hold PRON uh PRON uh conference on kova every day i do not know what tell PRON be add to PRON except PRON be good PRON be wear a mask and say the right thing mostly but this be about science this be about science this be about expertise this be about transparency and PRON have get to make PRON available to the american people because what everybody be find out all end with be PRON be that the circumstance be such that even when even when the business be open people be not show up because PRON do not think PRON be safe in many and so there ought to be a system whereby and which i propose that PRON can lay out the detail of what PRON be do in PRON business and be able to put a sign out that say PRON be safe PRON have meet all the standard but the idea that PRON be just go to say open up and people be go to show up PRON be not PRON be not should there be sport right now though should major league baseball go well PRON seem to PRON that PRON be probably not go to be able to happen base on base on what the league PRON be say i mean PRON have the marlin say PRON can not do PRON so many people so i think PRON should just follow the science the one thing that seem to work a little bit i do not know be basketball where no one travel PRON be all sequester in one place PRON be like look many of PRON have all of PRON have family mom dad etc if PRON come from another state PRON go from PRON from wherever PRON be to PRON state well PRON should be quarantine before PRON go see PRON up to day think about PRON the united states of america PRON can not travel to a whole hell of a lot of european country PRON can not get in a plane and go there do not come PRON be a danger to PRON PRON be because PRON be not follow the science and there be very little transparency of what be go on but i have confidence at the end of the day out of so when PRON PRON know when PRON have a lot of ball for football player turn down eight ten million buck a year and say PRON be not go to take the risk of play PRON get to listen PRON got to listen so PRON be not go to opine on every sport but PRON seem to PRON that when PRON have to travel when PRON have to be in hotel room or place that be different than PRON have be the day before when PRON be in a position where PRON walk go into an area where there be a high concentration of the spread of covet all those thing add up to a real problem and i do not and PRON be not go to really overcome that until PRON follow the science and get a vaccine but i want to say PRON again PRON be go to keep say PRON the president as PRON speak should be start and should have start three month ago to put someone in charge of how specifically like wage a war how be PRON go to distribute the vaccine when PRON arrive when PRON arrive when PRON be there and the question of whether PRON be real when PRON be there that require enormous transparency PRON have get to make all of PRON available to other expert across the nation so PRON can look and see so there be consensus this be a safe vaccine because already PRON have what percentage the american people say if the vaccine be there tomorrow PRON would not take PRON and PRON be not the usual anti vaccine crowd PRON be beyond that because people be lose faith in what the president say think about PRON what the word of a president matter significantly PRON can as i say before take PRON to war PRON can bring peace PRON can rise to cause the market to rise PRON can do good thing but people listen to what a president say and if a president repeatedly say thing to PRON that be not true and then there come a time when PRON say i have something that i think can cure PRON but PRON could really hurt PRON PRON be not go to listen to the guy who say be lie to PRON in the long run anyway thank PRON so much appreciate the time and PRON be get out of here thank PRON all right PRON
66,BcMEeXa1Kvc,biden,2020-08-12T22:29:45Z,Joe Biden introduces Kamala Harris as running mate,speech,vice president biden hello hello thanks for being here i wish we were able to talk to the folks outside but we're keeping our social distancing and playing by the rules good afternoon everyone to me and to uh come on listen exciting day it's a great day for our campaign and it's a great day for america in my view over the past several weeks i've had incredible privilege of meeting and spending a good deal of time with a group of talented women leaders all of whom are qualified to be president with each one the more i learned about them the more i talked to them the more impressed i was even though i knew them before i want to thank each and every one of them for being part of this process i look forward to working with them as we rebuild this country to get elected and once we are elected god willing i approach this with a seriousness of purpose and of mind because this is a serious moment for our nation we're at one of those inflection points you've heard me say that before in our history a life-changing election for this nation and the choice the choice we make this november is going to decide the future of america for a very very long time and i had a great choice great opportunities i had a great choice but i have no doubt that i picked the right person to join me as the next vice president united states of america and that's senator kamala harris you know and it seems americans all across this nation at least at the outset here agree with me yesterday we had our best grassroots funders raising day of the campaign more than double our previous record and in doing so we set a single day record for online political fundraising and i think i know why so i hope i hope that you'll join us as well those of you who listen today go to joebiden.com today five dollars ten dollars whatever kamala as you all know is smart she's tough she's experienced she's a proven fighter for the backbone of this country the middle class for all those who are struggling to get into the middle class kamala knows how to govern she knows how to make the hard calls she's ready to do this job on day one and we're both ready to get to work rebuilding this nation and building it better as attorney general the largest state in the country commonwealth took on the big banks over mortgage fraud and one took on big oil when i wanted to pollute without consequences she was a pioneer in marriage equality and tackled the gun lobby you know we've all watched in the united states senate go toe-to-toe with trump officials trying to hide the truth asking the tough questions needed to be asked and not stopping until she got an answer and when none was forthcoming it was obvious what the answer was as a member of the intelligence committee and the judiciary committee she's been the center in the middle of the most critical national security challenges our country faces well aware well aware of all the threats to this nation and ready to respond to them as a child of immigrants she knows personally how immigrant families enrich our country as well as the challenges of what it means to grow up black and indian-american in the united states of america her story is america's story different from mine in many particulars but also not so different in the essentials she's worked hard she's never backed down from a challenge and she has earned each and every of the accolades and achievements that she has gained many of them often in the face of obstacles that others put in their way but never quit and this morning all across the nation little girls woke up especially little black and brown girls who so often feel overlooked and undervalued in their communities but today today just maybe they're seeing themselves for the first time in a new way as the stuff of president and vice presidents in her campaign in the primary camel often talked about what you referred to as the 3am agenda about moms and dads awake late at night in their kitchens worried scared uncertain about how they were going to take care of their families about how they were going to pay the bills about how they were going to make it simply make it growing up in scranton and claymont delaware i saw that struggle with my family as well kamal assault with hers as well and millions of americans are living that struggle as we speak especially in this moment of crisis especially with so many jobs lost kamala and i both know that all folks you're looking for as my dad would say is an even shot just give me a shot a fair shot a shot at making it and it'll be the work of our administration to make sure they get a fair shot working families need someone on their side in this nation because they certainly don't have anyone in the president now on their side that's going to change in the biden harris administration it's going to be gratifying to see the strong enthusiastic reaction to senator harris as our next vice president you know it comes from people all over the country it's already occurring all over the country all ideological views all backgrounds events of course we are predictable some of them it comes from all over except of course from donald trump's white house and his allies you all knew was coming you could have set your watches to it donald trump has already started his attacks calling kamala quote nasty whining about how she is quote mean to his appointees it's no surprise because whining is what donald trump does best better than any president american history is anyone surprised donald trump has a problem with a strong woman or strong women across the board we know the more is to come so let's be clear if you're a working person worried about whether or not you'll have a job to go to whether or not you'll be able to pay your mortgage pay your rent worried about the poison in the air you breathe the water you drink worried about your civil rights even your basic right to dignity which is under attack with this administration kamala harris has had your back and now we have to have her back she's going to stand with me in this campaign and all of us are going to stand up for her on january 20th 2021 we're all going to watch senator harris raise her right hand and swear the oath of office as the first woman ever to serve in the second highest office in america in this land and then we're going to get to work fixing the mess that president trump and vice president pence have created both at home and abroad through four years of mismanagement and coddling of terrorists and thugs around the world not only will america dig itself out of this hole they put us in we're going to build we're going to build back we're going to build back better we have a public health crisis while he's in court trying to do away with health care with more than 5 million reported infections 165 000 people dead and climbing as a consequence of cover 19. and still months later no real leadership or plan from the president united states how to get this pandemic under control no real help for the states and local governments trying to fill the vacuum of leadership from the white house no real help for children and educators for small businesses and front-line workers that hold in their ones holding our country together instead he's issuing executive orders and making promises that in the end will defund the social security system while insisting that this virus will disappear the joe biden and kamala harris administration will have a comprehensive plan to meet the challenge of covert 19 and turn the corner on this pandemic masking clear science-based guidance dramatically scaling up testing getting states and local governments the resources they need to open the schools and businesses safely we can do this we just need a president of the vice president willing to lead and take responsibility not as this president says it's not my fault the government the governor should thank me more as an old saying goes give me a break we have an economic crisis with more than 16 million americans 16 million still out of work donald trump is on track to break another record on track to leave office with the worst jobs record of any american president of modern history but instead of doing the hard work of meeting face to face with congressional democrats leaders republicans in the white house like every other president has done in a crisis to get americans the relief they need and deserve donald trump is on the golf course if i told you this three years ago you look at me like i was being crazy he hasn't even met with the leadership he doesn't have time it appears we have a climate crisis that donald trump refuses to even acknowledge when he thinks about climate change all here we hear is the word hoax the biden harris administration is going to meet the climate crisis protect the health of the american public and along the way we're going to deliver one word jobs good paying jobs with a racial justice crisis donald trump seeks only to inflame it with his politics of racist rhetoric and appeals to division you know today is not only the day i'm proud to introduce senator kamala harris as the vice presidential nominee of the democratic party it's also the third anniversary of that terrible day in charlottesville remember remember what it felt like to see those neo-nazis close your eyes and those klansmen white supremacists coming out of fields carrying lighted torches faces contorted bulging veins pouring into the streets of historic american city spewing the same anti-semitic bile we heard in hitler's germany in the 30s remember how it felt to see a violent clash ensue between those celebrating hate and those standing against it it was a wake-up call for all of us as a country for me it was a call to action my father used to say silence is complicity not original to him but he believed it at that moment i knew i couldn't stand by and let donald trump a man who went on to say when asked about what he thought he said there were very fine people on both sides quote very fine people on both sides no president of the united states of america has ever said anything like that see him continue to attack everything that makes america america i knew we were in the battle for the soul of the nation that's when i decided to run and i'm proud now to have senator harris at my side in that battle because she shares with the same intensity i do for she's someone who knows what's at stake the question is for all americans to answer who are we as a nation what do we stand for and most importantly what do we want to be you know someone who knows that the future of this country is limited only by the barriers we place on our own imaginations because there's nothing americans cannot achieve when we put our minds to it and we do it together one of the reasons i chose kamala is because we both believe that we can define america simply in one word possibilities possibilities let me say it again possibilities that's america what sets this nation apart is that everyone everyone the ability for everyone and we mean everyone to go as far and dream as big as hard work and their god-given ability will take them when i agreed to serve as president obama's running mate he asked me a number of questions as i've asked comma but the most important was he said to me what he asked me what i wanted most importantly i told him i wanted to be the last person in the room before he made important decisions that's what i asked pamela i asked common to be the last voice in the room to always tell me the truth which she will challenge my assumptions if she disagrees ask the hard questions because that's the way we make the best decisions for the american people i got a chance to spend some time at my home today with kamal and doug and i want to thank them i thank them them and thank them publicly for agreeing to join and take this journey with chilling me doug you're going to have to learn what it means to be a barrier breaker yourself in this job you're about to take on america's first second gentleman and all their although they're not with us here today i want to thank ellen cole as well i had a chance to speak to doug's mom and dad and ellen cole and uh we're going to get our kids together to let them know what's coming our my grandchildren are about the age of uh their children i got to speak to them my campaign has always been a family affair every campaign i've run so i've got some news for you you're all honorary bidens [Laughter] and here's the best part kamala you've been an honorary biden for quite some time you know i came first to know who kamala was through our son bobite they were friends they served as attorneys general at the same time they took the same big they took on the same big fights together common california bow here in delaware big fights that helped change the entire country i know how much beau respected kamal and her work and that mattered a lot to me to be honest with you as i made this decision so now we need to get to work pulling this nation out of these crises we find ourselves in getting our economy back on track uniting this nation and yes winning the battle for the soul of america my fellow americans now let me introduce to you for the first time your next vice president states kamala harris kamala the floor is yours what do you want there you go [Music] thank you joe thank you thank you joe as i said joe when you called me i am incredibly honored by this responsibility and i'm ready to get to work i am ready to get to work after the most competitive primary in history the country received a resounding message that joe was the person to lead us forward and joe i'm so proud to stand with you and i do so mindful of all the heroic and ambitious women before me whose sacrifice determination and resilience makes my presence here today even possible this is a moment of real consequence for america everything we care about our economy our health our children the kind of country we live in it's all on the line we're reeling from the worst public health crisis in a century the president's mismanagement of the pandemic has plunged us into the worst economic crisis since the great depression and we're experiencing a moral reckoning with racism and systemic injustice that has brought a new coalition of conscience to the streets of our country demanding change america is crying out for leadership yet we have a president who cares more about himself than the people who elected him a president who is making every challenge we face even more difficult to solve but here's the good news we don't have to accept the failed government of donald trump and mike pence in just 83 days we have a chance to choose a better future for our country so joe dr biden thank you for the trust you've placed in me jill i know you will be an incredible first lady and my husband doug and i are so grateful grateful to become a part of your extended family and ever since i received joe's call i've been thinking yes about the first biden that i really came to know and that of course is joe's beloved son one of his beloved sons beau in the midst of the great recession beau and i spoke on the phone practically every day sometimes multiple times a day working together to win back billions of dollars for homeowners from the big banks of the nation that were foreclosing on people's homes and let me just tell you about bo biden i learned quickly that bo was the kind of guy who inspired people to be a better version of themselves he really was the best of us and when i would ask him where did you get that where did this come from he'd always talk about his dad and i will tell you the love that they shared was incredible to watch it was the most beautiful display of the love between a father and a son and beau talked about how joe would spend four hours every day riding the rails back and forth from wilmington to washington so he could make breakfast for his kids in the morning and make it home in time to tuck them in bed each night all of this so two little boys who had just lost their mom and their sister in a tragic accident would know that the world was still turning and that's how i came to know joe he's someone whose first response when things get tough is never to think about himself but to care for everyone else he's someone who never asks why is this happening to me and instead asks what can i do to make life better for you his empathy his compassion his sense of duty to care for others is why i am so proud to be on this ticket and joe and i yes we are cut from the same cloth family is everything to me too and i cannot wait for america to get to know my husband doug and our amazing kids cole and ella because whether i'm cheering in the bleachers at a swim meet or setting up a college room dorm or helping my goddaughter prepare for her school debate or building legos with my godson or hugging my two baby nieces or cooking dinner sunday dinner my family means everything to me and i've had a lot of titles over my career and certainly vice president will be great but mamala will always be the one that means the most and you know my mother and father they came from opposite sides of the world to arrive in america one from india and the other from jamaica in search of a world-class education but what brought them together was the civil rights movement of the 1960s and that's how they met as students in the streets of oakland marching and shouting for this thing called justice in a struggle that continues today and i was part of it my parents would bring me to protest strapped tightly in my stroller and my mother shamala raised my sister maya and me to believe that it was up to us and every generation of americans to keep on marching she tell us don't sit around and complain about things do something so i did something i devoted my life to making real the words carved in the united states supreme court equal justice under law and 30 years ago i stood before a judge for the first time breathed deep and uttered the phrase that would that would truly guide my career and the rest of my career kamala harris for the people the people that's who i represented as district attorney fighting on behalf of victims who needed help the people that's who i fought for as california's attorney general when i took on transnational criminal organizations who traffic in guns and drugs and human beings and it's the people who i have fought for as a united states senator where i've worked every day to hold trump officials accountable to the american people and the people are who joe and i will fight for every day in the white house and let me tell you somebody who has presented my fair share of arguments in court the case against donald trump and mike pence is open and shut just look where they've gotten us more than 16 million out of work millions of kids who cannot go back to school a crisis of poverty of homelessness afflicting black brown and indigenous people the most a crisis of hunger afflicting one in five mothers who have children that are hungry and tragically more than a hundred and sixty five thousand lives that have been cut short many with loved ones who never got the chance to say goodbye it didn't have to be this way six years ago in fact we had a different health crisis it was called ebola and we all remember that pandemic but you know what happened then barack obama and joe biden did their job only two people in the united states died two that is what's called leadership but compare that to the moment we find ourselves in now when other countries are following the science trump pushed miracle cures he saw on fox news while other countries were flattening the curve he said the vice would just poof go away quote like a miracle so when other countries opened back up for business what did we do we had to shut down again this virus has impacted almost every country but there's a reason it has hit america worse than any other advanced nation it's because of trump's failure to take it seriously from the start his refusal to get testing up and running his flip-flopping on social distancing and wearing masks his delusional belief that he knows better than the experts all of that is reason and the reason that an american dies of covid19 every 80 seconds it's why countless businesses have had to shut their doors for good it's why there is complete chaos over when and how to reopen our schools mothers and fathers are confused and uncertain and angry about child care and the safety of their kids at school whether they'll be in danger if they go or fall behind if they don't trump is also the reason millions of americans are now unemployed he inherited the longest economic expansion in history from barack obama and joe biden and then like everything else he inherited he ran it straight into the ground because of trump's failures of leadership our economy has taken one of the biggest hits out of all the major industrialized nations with an unemployment rate that has tripled as of today this is what happens when we elect a guy who just isn't up for the job our country ends up in tatters and so does our reputation around the world but let's be clear this election isn't just about defeating donald trump or mike pence it's about building this country back better and that's exactly what joe and i will do we'll create millions of jobs and fight climate change through a clean energy revolution bring back critical supply chains so the future is made in america build on the affordable care act so everyone has the peace of mind that comes with health insurance and finally offer caregivers the dignity the respect and the pay they deserve will protect a woman's right to make her own decisions about her own body root out systemic racism in our justice system and pass a new voting rights act a john lewis voting rights act that will ensure every voice is heard and every voice is counted the civil rights struggle is nothing new to joe it's why he got into public service it's why he helped reauthorize the voting rights act and restore unemployment discrimination and employment discrimination laws and today he takes his place in the ongoing story of america's march toward equality and justice as only as the only as the only who has served alongside the first black president and has chosen the first black woman as his running mate but as joe always points out this election is about more than politics it's about who we are as a country and i'll admit over the past four years there have been moments when i have truly worried about our future but whenever i think that there is a reason for doubt whenever i've had my own doubts i think of you the american people the doctors and nurses and front line workers who are risking your lives to save others the truck drivers and the workers in grocery stores in factories and farms working there putting your own safety on the line to help us get through this pandemic the women and students taking to the streets in unprecedented numbers the dreamers and immigrants who know that families belong together the lgbtq americans who know that love is love people of every age and color and creed who are finally declaring in one voice that yes black lives matter all across this country a whole new generation of children is growing up hearing the cries for justice and the chance of hope on which i was raised some strapped into strollers of their own and trust me it's a song you'll never forget so to everyone keeping up the fight you are doing something you are doing something great you are the heroes of our time and you are the reason i know we are going to bring our country closer to realizing its great promise but to do it we'll need to work organize and vote like never before because we need more than a victory on november third we need a mandate that proves that the past few years do not represent who we are or who we aspire to be joe likes to say that character is on the ballot and it's true when he saw what happened in charlottesville three years ago today he knew we were in a battle for the soul of our nation and together with your help that's a battle we will win earlier this year i said i do whatever joe asked me to do and so now i'm asking you to do the same so visit joebiden.com to get involved in this campaign and vote because electing joe biden is just the start of the work ahead of us and i couldn't be prouder to be by his side running to represent you the people thank you and may god bless the united states of america,b vice president biden hello hello thank for be here i wish PRON be

72,mmSOCQX2UGs,biden,2020-08-21T03:33:24Z,Joe Biden speaks at the 2020 Democratic National Convention | Full Speech,speech,good evening ella baker a giant of the civil rights movement left us with this wisdom give people light and they will find the way give people light those are words for our time the current president has cloaked american darkness for much too long too much anger too much fear too much division here and now i give you my word if you entrust me with the presidency i will draw on the best of us not the worst i'll be an ally of the light not the darkness it's time for us for we the people to come together and make no mistake united we can and will overcome this season of darkness in america we'll choose hope over fear facts over fiction fairness over privilege i'm a proud democrat and i'll be proud to carry the banner of our party into the general election so shows with great honor and humility i accept this nomination for president of the united states of america but while i'll be a democratic candidate i will be an american president i'll work hard for those who didn't support me as hard for them as i did for those who did vote for me that's the job of a president to represent all of us not just our base or our party this is not a partisan moment this must be an american moment it's the moment the calls for hope and light and love hope for our future light to see our way forward and love for one another america isn't just a collection of clashing interests of red states or blue states we're so much bigger than that we're so much better than that you know nearly a century ago franklin roosevelt pledged a new deal in a time of massive unemployment uncertainty and fear stricken by a disease stricken by a virus fdr insisted that he would recover and prevail and he believed america could as well and he did and we can as well this campaign isn't just about winning votes it's about winning the heart and yes the soul of america winning it for the generous among us not the selfish wanting it for workers to keep this country going not just the privileged few at the top waiting for those communities who have known the injustice of a knee on the neck for all the young people have known only america being rising in equity and shrinking opportunity they deserve the experience of america's promise they deserve to experience it in full you know no generation ever knows what history will ask of it all we can ever know is whether we're ready when that moment arrives and now history has delivered us to one of the most difficult moments america's ever faced four four historic crises all at the same time a perfect storm the worst pandemic in over a hundred years the worst economic crisis since the great depression the most compelling call for racial justice since the 60s and the undeniable realities and ex and just the accelerating threats of climate change so the question for us is simple are we ready i believe we are we must be you know all elections are important we know in our bones this one is more consequential as many have said america is at an inflection point a time of real peril but also extraordinary possibilities we can choose a path of becoming angrier less hopeful more divided a path of shadow and suspicion or or we can choose a different path and together take this chance to heal to reform to unite a path of hope and light this is a life-changing election this will determine what america is going to look like for a long long time character is on the ballot compassion is on the ballot decency science democracy they're all on the ballot who we are as a nation what we stand for most importantly who we want to be that's all on the ballot and the choice could not be more clear no rhetoric is needed just judge this president on the facts five million americans infected by covet 19. more than 170 000 americans have died by far the worst performance of any nation on earth more than 50 million people have filed for unemployment this year more than 10 million people are going to lose their health insurance this year nearly one in six small businesses have closed this year and this president if he's re-elected you know what will happen cases and deaths will remain far too high more mom-and-pop businesses will close their doors and this time for good working families will struggle to get by and yet the wealthiest one percent will get tens of billions of dollars in new tax breaks and the assault on the affordable care act will continue until it's destroyed taking insurance away from more than 20 million people including more than 15 million people on medicaid and getting rid of the protections that president obama worked so hard to get past for people who have 100 million more people who have pre-existing conditions and speaking of president obama a man i was honored to serve alongside for eight years as vice president let me take this moment to say something we don't say nearly enough thank you mr president you were a great president a president of our children could and did look up to no one's going to say that about the current occupant of the white house we know about this president is if he's given four more years he'll be what he's been for the last four years president takes no responsibility refuses to lead blames others cozies up to dictators and fans the flames of hate and division he'll wake up every day believing the job is all about him never about you is that the american you want for you your family your children i see a different america one that's generous and strong selfless and humble it's an american we can rebuild together as president the first step i will take we to get control of the virus that has ruined so many lives because i understand something this president hasn't from the beginning we will never get our economy back on track we will never get our kids safely back in schools we'll never have our lives back until we deal with this virus the tragedy of where we are today is it didn't have to be this bad just look around it's not this bad in canada or europe or japan or almost anywhere else in the world and the president keeps telling us the virus is going to disappear he keeps waiting for a miracle well i have news for him no miracle is coming we lead the world in confirmed cases lead the world in deaths our economy is in tatters with black latino asian american native american communities burying the brunt of it and after all this time the president still does not have a plan well i do if i'm your president on day one we'll implement the national strategy i've been laying out since march we'll develop and deploy rapid tests with results available immediately we'll make the medical supplies and protective equipment that our country needs and we'll make them here in america so we will never again be at the mercy of china or other foreign countries in order to protect our own people we'll make sure our schools have the resources they need to be open safe and effective we'll put politics aside we'll take the muzzle off our experts so the public gets the information they need and deserve honest unvarnished truth they can handle it we'll have a national mandate to wear a mask not as a burden but as a patriotic duty to protect one another in short we'll do what we should have done from the very beginning our current president has failed in his most basic duty to the nation he's failed to protect us he's failed to protect america and my fellow americans that is unforgivable as president i'll make you a promise i'll protect america i will defend us from every attack seen and unseen always without exception every time look i understand i understand how hard it is to have any hope right now on this summer night let me take a moment to speak to those of you who have lost the most i have some idea how it feels to lose someone you love i know that deep black hole that opens up in the middle of your chest and you feel like you're being sucked into it i know how mean and cruel and unfair life can be sometimes but i've learned two things first your loved one may have left this earth but they'll never leave your heart they'll always be with you you'll always hear them and second i found the best way through pain and loss and grief is to find purpose as god's children each of us have a purpose in our lives we have a great purpose as a nation to open the doors of opportunity to all americans to save our democracy to be a light to the world once again and finally to live up to and make real the words written in the sacred documents that founded this nation that all men and women are created equal endowed by their creator with certain inalienable rights among them life liberty and the pursuit of happiness you know my dad was an honorable decent man he got knocked down a few times pretty hard but he always got back up he worked hard and he built a great middle class life for our family he used to say joey i don't expect the government to solve my problems but i sure in hell expect them to understand them and then you say joey a job is about a lot more than a paycheck it's about your dignity it's about respect it's about your place in the community it's about being able to look your kid in the eye and say honey it's gonna be okay and mean it i've never forgotten those lessons that's why my economic plan is all about jobs dignity respect and community together we can and will rebuild our economy and when we do we'll not only build back we'll build back better with modern roads bridges highways broadband ports and airports as a new foundation for economic growth with pipes that transport clean water to every community with five million new manufacturing and technology jobs so the future is made in america well the health care system that lowers premiums deductibles drug prices by building on the affordable care act he's trying to rip away with an education system that trains our people for the best jobs of the 21st century there's not a single thing american workers can't do and where cost doesn't prevent young people from going to college and student debt doesn't crush them when they get out with the child care and elder care system that makes it possible for parents to go to work and for the elderly to stay in their homes with dignity with an immigration system that powers our economy and reflects our values and with newly empowered labor unions they're the ones that built the middle class with equal pay for women with rising wages you can raise a child on a family on and yes we're going to do more than praise our essential workers we're finally going to pay them pay them we can and we will deal with climate change it's not only a crisis it's an enormous opportunity an opportunity for america to lead the world in clean energy and create millions of new good paying jobs in the process and we can pay for these investments by ending loopholes unnecessary loopholes and the president's 1.3 trillion dollar tax giveaway to the wealthiest one percent and the biggest most profitable corporations some of which do not pay any tax at all because we don't need a tax code that rewards wealth more than it rewards work i'm not looking to punish anyone far from it but it's long past time the wealthiest people and the biggest corporations in this country paid their fair share and for our seniors social security is a sacred obligation a sacred promise made they paid for the current president is threatening to break that promise he's proposing to eliminate a tax that pays for almost half the social security without any way of making up for that lost revenue resulting in cuts i will not let that happen if i'm your president we're going to protect social security and medicare you have my word one of the most powerful voices we hear in the country today is from our young people they're speaking to the inequity and injustice that has grown up in america economic injustice racial injustice environmental injustice i hear their voices if you listen you can hear them too and whether it's the accidental existential threat posed by climate change the daily fear being gunned down in school or the inability to get started in your first job it will be the work of the next president to restore the promise of america to everyone and i'm not going to have to do it alone because i'll have a great vice president at my side senator kamala harris she's a powerful voice for this nation her story is the american story she knows about all the obstacles thrown in the way of so many in our country women black women black americans south asian americans immigrants the left out and the left behind but she's overcome every obstacle she's ever faced no one's been tough on the big banks than a gun on the gun lobby no one's been tougher in calling out the current administration for its extremism it's failure to follow the law it's failure to simply tell the truth kamal and i both draw from our families that's we get our strength for commons doug and their families for me it's jill and ours i've said many times no man deserves one great love in his life let alone two but i've known two after losing my first wife in that car accident jill came into my life she put our family back together she's an educator a mom a military mom and an unstoppable force if she puts her mind to it just get out of the way she's going to get it done she was a great second lady and i know she'll make a great first lady for this nation she loves this country so much and i'll always have the strength that can only come from family hunter ashley all our grandchildren my brothers my sister they give me courage they lift me up while he's no longer with us bo inspires me every day both served our nation in uniform a year in iraq a decorated iraqi war veteran so i take very personally and i the profound responsibility of serving as commander-in-chief i'll be a president who will stand with our allies and friends and make it clear to our adversaries the days of cozying up to dictators is over under president biden america will not turn a blind eye to russian bounties on the heads of american soldiers nor light put up with foreign interference on our most sacred democratic exercise voting and i'll always stand for our values of human rights and dignity a working common purpose for a more secure peaceful and prosperous world history history has thrust one more urgent task on us will we be the generation that finally wipes out the stain of racism from our national character i believe we're up to it i believe we're ready just a week ago yesterday was the third anniversary of the events in charlottesville close your eyes remember what you saw on television remember seeing those neo-nazis and klansmen and white supremacists coming out of fields with lighted torches veins bulging spewing the same same anti-semitic bile heard across europe in the 30s remember the violent clash that ensued between those spreading hate and those with the courage to stand against it and remember what the president said when asked he said there were quote very fine people on both sides it was a wake-up call for us as a country and for me a call to action at that moment i knew i'd have to run because my father taught us that silence was complicity and i can never remain silent or complicit at the time i said we're in the battle for the soul of this nation and we are you know one of the most important conversations i've had this entire campaign it was something this was someone who was much too young to vote i met with six-year-old gianna floyd the day before her daddy george floyd was laid to rest she's an incredibly brave little girl i'll never forget it when i leaned down to speak to her she looked in my eyes and she said i quote daddy changed the world daddy changed the world her words burrowed deep into my heart maybe george floyd murder was a breaking point maybe john lewis is passing the inspiration but however has come to be however it's happened america's ready in john's words to lay down quote the heavy burden of hate at last and then the hard work of rooting out our systemic racism you know american history tells us that it's been on our darkest moments that we've made our greatest progress that we found the light and this dark moment i believe we're poised to make great progress again that we can find the light once more you know many people have heard me say this but i've always believed you can define america in one word possibilities to defining feature america everything is possible that in america everyone and i mean everyone should be given an opportunity to go as far as their dreams and god-given ability will take them we can never lose that in times as challenging as these i believe there's only one way forward as a united america a united america united in our pursuit of a more perfect union united in our dreams of a better future for us and for our children united in our determination to make the coming years bright are you ready i believe we are this is a great nation we're a good and decent people for lord's sake this is the united states of america and there's never been anything we've been able to accomplish when we've done it together the irish poet sheamus heaney once wrote history says don't hope on this side of the grave but then once in a lifetime the longed for tidal wave of justice can rise up and hope and history rhyme this is our moment to make hope and history rhyme with passion and purpose let us begin you and i together one nation under god unite our love for america united in our love for each other for love is more powerful than hate hope is more powerful than fear and light is more powerful and dark this is our moment this is our mission may history be able to say that the end of this chapter of american darkness began here tonight as love and hope and light join in the battle for the soul of the nation and this is a battle we will win and we'll do it together i promise you thank you and may god bless you and may god protect our troops [Music] [Applause] got [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] this [Music] [Applause] oh [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] now [Music] make the world go round that's a big,b good evening ella baker a giant of the civil right movement leave PRON with this wisdom give people light and PRON will find the way give people light those be word for PRON time the current president have cloak american darkness for much too long too much anger too much fear too much division here and now i give PRON PRON word if PRON entrust PRON with the presidency i will draw on the good of PRON not the bad PRON will be an ally of the light not the darkness PRON be time for PRON for PRON the people to come together and make no mistake unite

77,aEGm-ZXA6gM,biden,2020-08-31T18:11:49Z,FULL VIDEO: Joe Biden delivers remarks on violence across America,speech,so check check check check check check check check check got it hey chad my good afternoon i want to thank carnegie mellon for providing this space and all the promise it holds for future jobs and a high-tech world in the recent days we've had a lot of talk about who's going where and how i've decided to come to pittsburgh to talk a little bit about what's going on right now in the early days of world war ii franklin roosevelt told the country and i quote the news is going to get worse and worse before it gets better and better and the american people deserve to have it straight from the shoulder straight from the shoulder the job of a president is to tell it straight from the shoulder tell the truth to be candid to face facts to lead not to incite that's why i'm speaking to you today the incumbent president is incapable of telling us the truth and capable of facing the facts and incapable of healing he doesn't want to shed light he wants to generate heat and he's stroking violence in our cities you know this is a tragic fact of the matter that about his perilous hour that how he's dealing with this perilous hour in our nation and now we have to stand against violence in every form it takes violence we've seen again and again and again of unwarranted police shooting excessive force seven bullets at the back of jacob blake neon the neck of george floyd killing abriana taylor in her own apartment violence of extremists an opportunist right-wing militias militias militias militias militias militias militias militia militia militia and to derail any hope and support for progress the senseless violence of looting and burning and destruction of property i want to make it absolutely clear something very clear about all of this rioting is not protesting looting is not protesting setting fires is not protesting none of this is protesting it's lawlessness plain and simple and those who do it should be prosecuted violence will not bring change it'll only bring destruction it's wrong in every way it divides instead of unites destroys businesses only hurts the working families that serve the community it makes things worse across the board not better no it's not what dr king or john lewis taught and it must end fires are burning and we have a president who fans the flames rather than fighting the flames but we must not burn we have to build this president long ago forfeited any moral leadership in this country he can't stop the violence because for years he's fomented it you know he may believe mouthing the words law and order makes him strong but his failure to call on his own supporters to stop acting as an armed militia in this country shows how weak he is does anyone believe there'll be less violence in america if donald trump is re-elected we need justice in america we need safety in america we're facing multiple crises crisis under donald trump have kept multiplying coveted economic devastation unwarranted police violence emboldened white nationalists a reckoning on race declining faith and the birth and the of the right american future there's no reason why we can't just do so much more than we're doing the common thread the incumbent president who makes things worse not better an incumbent president who shows chaos rather than providing order an incumbent president who fails in the basic duty of the job which is to advance the truth that all of us know that we're all born with the right to life liberty and pursuit of happiness that's right all of us the moms and dads in scranton where i grew up who have worked and scraped for everything they've ever gotten in life the auto worker in michigan who still makes the best automobile in the world a single mom in ohio working three jobs just to stay afloat he'll do anything for her child retired veteran in florida who gave everything he had to this country and now just wants us to honor the promises made to him lord and taylor sales person who just lost their job a store closing after 194 years in business nurses and doctors in wisconsin who've seen so much sickness so much death in the past six months and they wonder how much more how much more can they take but still they muster up the courage to take care of those patients in this pandemic while risking their own lives researchers in minnesota who woke up this morning determined to find a breakthrough in treating cancer and will do the same thing tomorrow and the day after and the day after because she'll never give up white black latino asian american native americans everybody i'm in this campaign for you no matter your color no matter your zip code no matter your politics when i think of the presidency i don't think about myself it isn't about my brand it's about you the american people we can do better and we have to do better and i promise you this we will do better you know the road back begins now in this campaign you know me you know my heart you know my story my family story ask yourself do i look like a radical socialist with a soft spot for rioters really i want a safe america safe from covert safe from crime and looting safe from racially motivated violence safe from bad cops me be crystal clear safe from four more years of donald trump i look at this violence and i see lives and communities and the dreams of small businesses being destroyed and the opportunity for real progress on issues of race and police reform and justice being put to the test donald trump looks at this violence and he sees a political having failed to protect this nation from the virus that has killed more than a hundred and eighty thousand americans so far trump post on all caps tweet screaming law and order to save his campaign one of his closest political advisers in the white house doesn't even bother the speaking code she just comes out and she says it quote the more chaos violence the better it is for trump's reelection just think about that this is a sitting president of the united states of america he's supposed to be protecting his country but instead he's rooting for chaos and violence the simple truth is donald trump failed to protect america so now he's trying to scare america since donald trump and mike prince can't run on the record that has seen more american deaths to a virus this virus than the nation suffered in every war since korea combined since they can't run on their economy that has seen more people lose their jobs than any time since the great depression since they can't run on the simple proposition of sending our children safely back to school since they have no agenda or a vision for a second term trump pence are running on this and i find it fascinating quote you won't be safe in joe biden's america and what's their proof the violence we're seeing in donald trump's america these are not images of some imagined joe biden america in the future these are images of donald trump's america today he keeps telling you if only he was president it wouldn't happen if he was president he keeps telling us that he was president you'd feel safe well he is president whether he knows it or not and it is happening it's getting worse and you know why because donald trump adds fuel to every fire because he refuses to even acknowledge that there is a racial justice problem in america because he won't stand up to any form of violence he's got no problem with right-wing militia white supremacists and vigilantes with assault weapons often better armed than the police often in the middle of the violence at the protesters and aiming it there and because tens of millions of americans simply don't trust this president to respect their rights to hear their concerns or to protect them it doesn't have to be this way when president obama and i were in the white house we had to defend federal property we did it we didn't see it you didn't see us whipping up fears around the deployment of secret federal troops we just did our job and the federal property was protected when president obama and i were in office we didn't look at cities as democratic or republican run these are american cities but trump doesn't see him himself as president for all of america frankly i believe if i were president today the country would be safer and we've seen a lot less violence and here's why i have said we must address the issue of racial injustice i've personally spoken to george floyd's family and the jacob blake's family i know their pain and so do you i know the justice they seek and so do you they've told us none of this violence respects or honors george or jacob i believe we can bring these these these folks fighting for racial justice to the table i've worked with police in this country for many years i know most cops are good decent people i know how they risk their lives every time they put that shield on and go out the door and i'm confident i can bring the police to the table as well i'd make sure every mayor and governor had the support they needed from the federal government but i wouldn't be looking to use the united states military against our own people if i were president my language would be less divisive i'd be looking to lower the temperature in this country not raise it i'd be looking to unite the nation but look if donald trump wants to ask the question who will keep you safer as president let's answer that question first some simple facts when i was vice president violent crime fell 15 in this country we did it without chaos and disorder and yes we did it with democratic mayors in most of the major cities in this country the murder right now is up 26 across the nation this year under donald trump do you really feel safer under donald trump covet has taken this year just since the outbreak has taken more than 100 years look here's the lives it's just it's when you think about it more lives this year than any other year for the past hundred years more than a hundred eighty thousand lives in just six months an average of a thousand people dying every day in the month of august do you really feel safe under donald trump mr trump you want to talk about fear do you know what people are afraid of in america they're afraid they're going to get coveted they're afraid they're going to get sick and die and that is in no small part it's because of you we're now on track to more than 200 000 deaths in this country due to coving more than 100 000 seniors have lost their lives of the virus more cops have died from covet this year than have been killed on patrol nearly one in six small businesses is closed in this country today do you really feel safer under trump what about trump's plan to destroy the affordable care act and with it the protections for pre-existing conditions that impacts more than 100 million americans does that make you feel safer or how about trump's plan to defund social security the social security administration's chief actuary just released a report saying that if a plan like the one trump is proposing goes into effect the social security trust fund would be and i quote permanently deplete it by the middle of calendar year 2023 with no ability to pay benefits thereafter put it plainly trump's plan would wipe out social security period you feel safer and more secure now the fear that reigns under this president doesn't stop at our shores the kremlin has put bounties on the heads of american soldiers and instead of telling vladimir putin that there'll be no putting up with this that there'll be a heavy price to pay they dare touch an american soldier this president doesn't even bring up the subject in his multiple phone calls with putin reported that russian forces just attacked american troops in syria injuring our service members did you hear the president say a single word did he lift one finger never before has an american president played such a subservient role to a russian leader it's not only dangerous it's humiliating and embarrassing for the rest of the world to see it weakens us not even american troops can feel safer under trump donald trump's role as a bystander in his own presidency extends to the economic plan and pain the plan he doesn't have and the pain being felt by millions of americans he said this week and i quote you better vote for me or you're going to have the greatest depression you've ever seen does he not understand and see the tens of millions of people who've had to file for unemployment this year so far the people who won't be able to make next month's rent payment the people who lost wages while the cost of groceries have gone up dramatically president obama and i stopped the depression in 2009. we took a bad economy that was falling and turned it around trump took a good economy and drove it back into the ditch through his failure to get coveted under control his failure to pull together the leaders in congress his failure to deliver real relief to working people has made our country economic situation so much worse so much worse than it had to be we talk about safety and security we should talk about basic security of being able to look your child in the eye and tell them everything's going to be okay don't worry honey we're not going to lose our home we're going to be able to put food in the table it's going to be okay it's a job of a president i've laid out an agenda for economic recovery that will restore a sense of security for working families we won't just build things back the way they were before we're going to build them back better with good paying jobs building our nation's roads bridges solar rays windmills with investments in our health care and child care workers so they get the pay and dignity they deserve while easing the financial burdens on millions of families with a clean energy strategy that is a place for the energy workers right here in western pennsylvania i am not banning frackie let me say that again i am not banning frackie no matter how many times donald trump lies about me this future the future that's what this is all about you know we hear donald trump's self-centered rants and rifts but the voice of americans should be heard the one you should listen to is julia jackson the mother of jacob blake hers is a voice of courage character and wisdom looking at the damage that has been done in her city she said quote the violence and destruction doesn't reflect my son or my family these are the words of a mom a mother whose son had just been shot seven times in front of his children badly injured paralyzed perhaps permanently and even as she seeks justice for her son she's pleading for an end to the violence and for this nation to heal she said she was praying for her son then she said something to me that that surprised me she said she was praying for all police officers since she was already been praying for america even before her son was shot she's publicly asked all of us to examine our hearts citizens elected officials the police all of us and then she said this quote we need healing more than anything that's what we need to do as a nation we need to heal the current president wants you to live in fear he advertises himself as a figure of order he isn't and he's not been part of the solution thus far he's part of the problem the problem i as president will give you my all resolve to stop i'll deal with the virus i'll deal with the economic crisis and i'll work to bring equality and opportunity to everyone we've arrived at a moment in this campaign we all knew including the press in front of me knew we'd get to the moment when donald trump would be so desperate he'd do anything to hold on to power donald trump has been a toxic presence in our nation for four years poisoning how we talk to one another poisoning how we treat one another poisoning the values this nation has always held dear poisoning our very democracy now there's just a little over 60 days we have a decision to make will we rid ourselves of this toxin or will we make a permanent part we make it a permanent part of our nation's character you know as americans i'm confident we believe in honesty and decency treating everyone with dignity and respect giving everyone a fair shot leaving no one behind giving hate no safe harbor and demonizing no one we hope to now always recognize there's something bigger than ourselves as we're about trump doesn't seem to believe in any of that look i've said it before and i'll keep saying it america is an idea it's the most powerful idea in the history of the world and i believe it beats in the hearts of the people of this country all men and women are created equal and they deserve to be treated equally trump has sought to remake this nation in his image selfish angry dark and divisive this is not who we are at her best america has always been and if i have anything to do with it will be again generous confident an optimistic nation full of hope and resolve donald trump is determined to instill fear in america that's what his entire campaign for the president has come down to fear but i believe americans are stronger than that i believe will be guided by the words of pope john paul ii words drawn from the scriptures be not afraid be not afraid fear never builds the future but hope does and building the future as america does what we've always done in fact it's what we have done best and continue to do best this is the united states of america there's not a single thing beyond our capacity when we decide to do it together so let's get together i want to thank you all may god bless you and may god protect our troops sir you,b so check check check check check check check check check get PRON hey chad PRON good afternoon i want to thank carnegie mellon

79,CiANHbSPyF8,biden,2020-09-02T18:08:28Z,"FULL VIDEO: Joe Biden makes remarks on education and takes questions in Wilmington, Delaware",speech,good afternoon folks welcome to the queen theater i'm here today to talk about a crisis a crisis being felt all across the united states of america and jill and i have just been briefed as you know in this room by our public health and education experts about what it's going to take to be able to reopen our school safely and effectively and uh back to school has always been a special time it isn't your families of mine but particularly in mine because for uh all the years jill and i are married she was going back to school too as a teacher jill's an educator and she'll be the first one to tell you that this should be a season of promise for our country times when crass classrooms are crackling with the possibilities the new year students hopes and the uh all about the future but this year we're facing the most difficult circumstances and we're seeing an awful lot of heart and a lot of grit from our educators our students and to try to rise to the occasion here but our government hasn't come up to that bar i haven't shown much grit at all or determination let me be clear if president trump and his administration had done their jobs early on with this crisis american schools would be open and to be open safely instead american families all across this country are paying the price for his failures and his administration's failures like many of you because you're all reporters you also have a lot of friends and you have children and you're probably hearing the same thing i'm hearing throughout this pandemic they're struggling to figure out how to do the right thing but they're worried they're worried like the devil they uh what does it mean for my kids is is this setting my child's education back beyond just a semester what impact will it have how my child is going to how's my child going to catch up what if what if i'm not doing enough to help my child succeed all those questions the self-doubt that's been engaged president trump may not think is this a national emergency but i think going back to school for millions of children and the impacts on their families and the community is a national emergency i believe that's what it is protecting our students our educators our communities getting our schools open safely and effectively this is a national emergency but president trump still doesn't have any real plan for how to open our school safely no real plan for how to help parents feel secure for their children he's offering nothing but failure and delusions from the start to finish the american families and our children are paying the price for his failures failure to take this virus seriously early on in january and february and it spread around the globe failure to take steps we needed back in march and april to get this pandemic under control to institute widespread testing and tracing to control the spread failure to provide clear national science-based guidelines to state and local authorities and failure to model even basic responsibility like socially distancing and wearing a mask and failure to make sure educators and administrators have the equipment the resources and the training they need to open safely under the circumstances we find now donald trump and betsy devos haven't secretary devos haven't stepped up and we're all seeing the results millions of students are now starting the new school year in the same way they finished the last one at home at home parents are doing their best but more and more were finding themselves at wit's end struggling to balance work and child care and education duties educational duties or worrying about their lost paycheck and how they make ends meet while trying to keep their kids on track with remote learning educators are taking on countless hours of additional training to learn how to use remote learning tools so they can still be there for their students but they're worried about all the kids who used to count in ours on our schools all those children who need it so badly and particularly those children who need more than the education they provide their meals and safe places to spend the day you know we're all concerned about making sure covert 19 doesn't further exacerbate the disparities the disparities that already have existed in our educational system for so many poor children and in so many communities of color it's unacceptable and it can't go on like this we all want our schools to reopen safely with a plan that prioritizes the health of our students and our educators and staff alike i laid out my plans back in june and july a road map for how to open reopen safely and effectively you can read them by going to joebiden.com we need straightforward common sense solutions but trump refuses to act starving schools of the needed funding funding they need now now they needed it beginning of the summer now trump's fema director is cutting schools loose just yesterday fema announced that they're not after helping three districts i think it was three they announced that they're not going to help pay for cloth masks other ppe or for school settings cleaning those basic health needs or sanitize everything from the laboratories to the classrooms and safety costs for schools that don't qualify for emergency assistance this is emergency mr president this is an emergency and donald trump and his fema should treat it as one if our president of the day i direct fema to make sure that our kids k through 12 get full access to disaster relief and emergency assistance under the stafford act i'd make sure that ppe and sanitation supplies for school qualify as emergency protective measures which is the phrase they use to fully be eligible for federal assistance on top of that i'd be working with the leaders of congress now today to pass emergency packages for schools so they have the resources they need in order to be able to open safely money for ventilation i heard that a lot when i had all those health care workers those health care experts up on the up on the zoom money for ventilation other health measures but also more money to hire more teachers every recommendation we got was they're going to be they should be dividing into pods smaller classes smaller classes mean more educators are needed keeping classes socially distanced small money for more psychologists and counselors i introduced legislation a long time ago calling for i introduced i proposed legislation a long time ago we have one one school psychology every 1507 children in school and the health care the mental health that our children need now the anxiety they're feeling at home in going to school not being able to go to school the nation's superintendents of schools have estimated that they'll need at least 200 billion dollars to support k-12 schools throughout the year for safe reopening and we need the money to hire educators as well of our for as for our four-year colleges and universities for community colleges for hbcus for minority serving institutions democratic leaders are ready to get this done they've already proposed legislation mr president where are you where are you why aren't you working on this we need emergency support funding for our schools and we need it now mr president that's your job that's your job that's what you should be focused on now getting our kids back to school safely keeping schools safely able to remain open once they stay once they open not whipping up fear and division not inciting violence in our streets get off twitter and start talking to the congressional leaders in both parties invite them to the oval office the oval office and stop your boast about never seemed to what you you you can do anything you're you you always talk about your ability to negotiate negotiate a deal a deal for somebody other than yourself now i'm happy to take questions you may have i guess staff's going to call on whoever follow fire away thank you mr vice president uh two quick questions for you if i may uh first ahead of your trip to kenosha wisconsin tomorrow last week your running mate senator harris said that the officer who shot jacob blake based on what she has seen should be charged do you agree with her and do you also believe the same for the officers who were involved in the death of briana taylor i think we should let the judicial system work its way i do think there's a minimum need to be charged the officers and as well as brianna taylor and uh i might add by the way i think what happened in portland where a one of the trump guys riding along in vans and citing responses shooting rubber bullets i guess or paintballs apparently there was someone shot by someone in the crowd with a bullet killed i think that person should meet the legal requirements that whatever that calls for we should be investigated and it should follow through on what needs to be done let the judicial system work let's make sure justice is done and just uh quickly on a different topic there's a new book by the new york times's michael schmidt that says that when president trump made an unannounced visit to walter reed hospital in 2019 vice president pence was told to be on standby to take over in case president trump had to receive anesthesia penn said last night that he doesn't recall being told that as vice president were you ever told to be on standby or given you know a any kind of special alert when president obama was going in for a medical appointment and i also just wonder whether you have any concerns about the fact that that walter reed visit that president trump made it didn't follow you know prior protocol about presidential visits for medical examinations i'm not going to speculate on what it means always what i can say is that nothing this administration does is normal and so i'm not being a facetious when i say that so who in god's name knows what it's all about i just don't know i don't know and i'm not going to speculate i'll let the experts do that and so and the only time that i have been on notice is when the president's out of the country and i'm in the country that not that i should wait for something to be immediately be aware of anything but that that that's something that would might be called for it wasn't called for thank you thank you mr vice president on this visit to kenosha tomorrow local democratic officials including the governor had previously discouraged president trump from visiting and just yesterday the president of the local naacp said he didn't want to see either of the candidates including herself visit that this is such a sensitive situation in the city why is now the right time for you to go to kenosha and what do you hope to accomplish tomorrow well i have uh we've spoken to all the leaders up there and although i have an outstanding call with the governor we've dealt with the staff because and there's been overwhelming requests that i do come because what we want to do is we got to heal we got to put things together bring people together and so my purpose in going will be to do just that to be a positive influence on what's going on talk about what need be done and try to see if there's a beginning of a mechanism to bring the folks together we have to heal this is about making sure that that we move then we move forward and so i i've gotten advice from sitting members of the congress in the senate as well to go and that i should go i'm not going to do anything other than meet with meetings with community leaders as well as business people and other folks in law enforcement and to see uh we start to talk about what has to be done not i'm not going to tell kenosha what they have to do but we have to do together the idea that we are saying you know we've the president's encourage people to retreat to their corners and keep this this moving is just a mistake i've spent my whole life including in this city you're in right now bringing people together bringing the community and and police officers together bringing business leaders and civic leaders together and so that's my purpose in going and on the fact that you're traveling to wisconsin at all i believe this is only the third time in the last few months since the onset of the pandemic that you'll be on a plane you've talked about how you want to make sure you follow all the advice of your doctors in terms of campaigning safely but the question we keep hearing from voters from others is why aren't you out there more you may be aware the president was calling to question your campaign's schedule today how far are you willing to push the envelope of what's safe in order to get your message out and to be among the voters speak to them directly well i think my message is getting out based on what the all the polling data shows and the millions of people who've watched what i've had to say and the circumstances which i've said it but i would like to get out more but i think a president has a responsibility to set examples set the right example for how to get out not go out and not wear a mask and not to have large crowds of people standing next to one of them not wearing masks not being a potential cauldron for a significant outbreaks of covid and so what i've done is i've met with via via what i did this morning with the medical experts and so we've worked out a protocol where how i get in the plane what kind of plane i get on how it's sanitized where how i engage people it's like when i'm engaging all of you everywhere i go it's always at a safe distance and everybody's wearing masks and the vast majority of people that i'm meeting with have been that come into my home and staff and the like they're all tested as well so i'm just trying to set the example wearing the protective gear the mask which i have with me i'm able at this distance to take it off number one number two making sure that we proceed in a way with adequate social distancing and do it the right way and last quickly they announced the format and the moderators of the presidential debates today nbc's kristen welker batting cleanup for that last presidential debate is there anything you said you'll participate is there anything that could dissuade you from participating and how have you begun to prepare well i've begun to prepare by by going over what the president has said multiple lies he's he's told what i'd love to have is a crawler at the bottom of the screen a fact checker you know we speak uh if we really wanted to do something i think that would make a great great debate if everything both of us said was instantly fact checked by by an agreed to group of people out there that we we move forward but that probably wouldn't get very far in the debate now i'm looking forward to debating the president and i uh and i'm going to uh lay out as clearly as i can what i think we have to do to bring this country back and build it back better and i'm looking forward to the debate thank you mr vice president um one of the things that i've heard a lot from voters across the country is that a lot of them are worried and concerned about some of the ongoing violence we've seen in cities in this country including the situation in kenosha wisconsin where you're headed i'm curious obviously you're not president now and donald trump is but i'm curious if you were president what would you do to ensure that people are kept safe in situations like these first of all i wouldn't incite violence i'd condemn it when it occurred i would move to look the vast majority a police officer good decent honorable women and men they pin on that shield every morning and they have a right to go home that night safely the vast majority but just those who are not good cops i'm all the police i've dealt with my whole life and i've been dealing with i've gotten overwhelming support from law enforcement through my whole career they're the ones that want to get rid of the bad cops even more than anybody else does because it reflects on them number one number two i would make sure everybody understood if i were president that any violence any violence protesting is a right and free speech is a right but to engage in violence burning looting the rest in the name of protesting is wrong and the persons should be held accountable for their actions and so um what i'd be doing is i'd be bringing people together in the white house right now i'd be having that police commission set up i'd have law enforcement at the table i'd have the community at the table i'd have people and saying how do we get through this what do we do to deal with this because i believe the vast majority of the community at large as well as law enforcement want to straighten things out not inflame things but this president keeps throwing gasoline in the fire every place he goes i noticed and i didn't watch much of it but i watched the reports from all of you not all from the press and uh you know when he was asked about what should be done with regard to a young man shot in the back seven times in front of his children i didn't hear much of anything come from him what should we be doing about and he went down down the line so i wish he'd take responsibility as much as he'd like to be running against somebody else he's running against me joe biden and the fact is that he is not acting very responsibly thank you mr vice president you've you've asked i'm sorry am i over here okay you've outlined your school your plan to reopen schools safely but what about what happens in the interim right now millions of parents across the country are facing this very impossible task of trying to work full-time and help their children full time to learn virtually what is your message to these parents and what can you do to help them while you work to reopen schools help is on the way i've laid out a clear plan for child care a clear plan for starting early education as well so three and four and five-year-olds are in school and like but i'm not president right now what we should be doing is we should be providing for more help for people who in fact are trying to juggle the choice between do i stay home with my three four or five year old and take care of them in the middle of this covet problem or do i go to work and earn a salary what do i do and so that's why we have i have a major initiative to deal with child care and elder care so people can be adequately paid to come and take care of folks children as well as the elderly that you may be taking care of a parent a a a husband or wife may be taken care of as well as making sure that those folks are able to get back to work and that's why focusing on day care centers and making sure they're safe and healthy now is equally as important as dealing with almost as equally important as dealing with schools and we should be providing all of the ppe and all of the safety that is necessary in sanitary capacity to allow them to open hundreds of them have been opening because some states have gone in and done that there should be universal guidance coming from the president united states of america there should be basic standards to how in fact and what circumstance you can safely open a daycare center you can safely safely open a child care center in addition to that in the future the idea this has brought home a number of glaring problems we have in america this whole pandemic and what's happened in terms of jobs the idea that we're in a situation where you have so many parents who have to make the difficult choice as a single parent or both working parents to decide whether one gives up their salary and stays home with a child under the age of five or six and or somehow leaves them with somebody that is not particularly qualified and goes to work so they can earn a living is a choice that is not we shouldn't be making we're the only industrialized country in the world that forces people to make that kind of choice so there should be no one should have to pay more than seven percent of their income income to provide for child care and be able to go to work this is something that is a major element of my build back better program but in the meantime in the meantime the most important thing that can be done is have cdc issues really straightforward guidelines on what circumstances you should be able to open up a your day care center or your child care center now and there should be clear standards and states should have the wherewithal to be able to go out and inspect those facilities now but you know one thing i haven't mentioned and i think it warrants mentioning you know one of the things we did remember well when we inherited the great recession and we were going into the tank heading off the cliff for uh heading to a depression i was able to convince three republicans to change their vote and we ended up with the so-called recovery act which spent over 800 billion dollars in 18 months kept us from going into depression but what did we do we spent almost we spent billions of dollars making sure that states were able to maintain their essential workers everyone from their fire departments their school teachers their doctors their nurses their public hospitals now what's happening this republican administration will not support that and the republican leadership in the united states senate will not support it so what's happening we don't have that help it's not out there and states are in real trouble and to quote my good friend mitch mcconnell he says let the states go bankrupt states have to balance their budgets under the law communities counties cities they have to balance their budget there's a reason why the federal government is able to run a deficit to compensate in times of real economic crisis and what's happening nothing nothing and guess what we came out of that recession with the the longest spurt of economic growth of any administration in american history but these guys don't i don't see and i could go on businesses look at the money that was passed under the cares act for businesses small businesses be able to stay open you got tens of thousands of them going out of business many of them permanently why because the money didn't get to small businesses they're not they're not open we should be dealing with those those businesses that have been burned out and those and damaged we should be providing federal help for those businesses to get back on their feet but this administration seems to think it's all of a sudden going to go away like angel dust is going to be sprayed around everything will be okay i just don't get it they have to know better they have to know better and we had an example just the last administration how much good you can do and how much growth you can generate i just don't get these guys i really don't not a joke i've been doing this a long time but i've never seen a president lack as much leadership unwilling on inability to make a deal and you got about i'm told the reason why they can't get anything done in the republican congress is 20 members of the united states senate say under no circumstances will they raise the deficit at all well that's wonderful and we're in a position we're in now look at other countries they're doing one hell of a lot better and yet we still have over what's up to 186 000 people dead over 6 million was it 6 million 300 000 whatever the number is that have contracted the disease and no end in sight it's just irresponsible talk about a know-nothing congress on the republican side no nothing president i mean i don't get it i really don't get it but it's going to change come january god willing sir what do you say to the teachers who are afraid to return to the classroom even if the safety protocols that you've proposed are in place well i say that i understand they're concerned because so many of the teachers also have other pre-existing conditions that lend itself to the fact that if they were to contract the covet the covert disease coven 19 that they would be very susceptible to be in real trouble so it's understandable why they're doing it but the first thing to do is make sure that all the protective capacity that we have available to us is made available and then make choices about whether or not let the districts make choice about whether or not they open fully whether they rotate and whether or not those teachers are able to be able to teach from home and remote learning but i it's really understandable why they would look look what's happened in in this uh covett crisis so far a hundred million i think a hundred thousand people have died who were above the age of sixty-five hundred thousand out of the two hundred and some that have died are not two hundred something yet it's 189 or whatever it is now estimated i heard today that estimates range from two uh two significant universities one is going to be as many as 200 239 i think and another one said by december 312 i don't know that but that's you know it's going to go higher and so i just don't uh i don't understand why it's a political problem what is the politics about not being willing to go in and help provide the protective capacity for people to be able to go back to work and don't go to school i i i i just don't i can't fathom it thank you mr vice president um you talked today about reopening schools i wanted to ask you about something you said last week about rio the potential of having to shut down the economy again you were asked if you'd be willing to shut it down if your health experts advise you to do so you said quote i will be prepared to do whatever it takes and that you would listen to the scientists but i'm curious how you would do that at a federal level and how you would balance that call to shut down potentially if you had economic advisers saying you do this again you could plunge the country into an even deeper economic crisis well look i know you're tired of hearing me say this i've been saying it uh since uh last january the idea that you're gonna be able to get the economy back on track without getting covered under control is completely counter-intuitive it's not there it can't happen so unless we're able to deal with the disease and drastically cut its impact on people's confidence of being able to either go to work or walk into a business or do business then it doesn't matter a lot there is going to be no need in my view to be able to shut down the whole economy i got asked by david muir a question if i was asked to shut everything down i took that as a generic question if am i going to follow the science i am going to insist and i insist now without any authority that every responsible person in this country when they're out in public or not with a cohort that they have lived with because they know they haven't spread your husband wife etc that they wear a mask that they wear a mask and keep socially distanced you can take a mask off when you're 12 15 feet away but i would follow i would really really make the case and by the way when i find these folks talking about my freedom i talk about patriotism why do you wear a mask to protect your neighbor to keep someone else from getting sick and maybe dying i call that patriotic this is the united states of america every generation has made sacrifices to help others in moments of crisis but so you don't see you you had suggested there would be some kind of a federal mandate about masks and now you're saying no no no no here's what i suggested was i would ask every person in authority there's a question whether or not a president under the constitution could mandate every more mass and remember all during the primary i'd have a lot of people telling me i would buy executive order do i'm a constitutionalist you know you can't do things the constitution doesn't allow you the power to do what i would be doing is putting as much pressure as i could on every governor every senator i'm excited every mayor every county executive every local official and everyone in business putting pressure on them to say what you're doing is irresponsible make sure you wear a mask and maintain social distancing and the vast majority of the american people accept that notion one more quick campaign question you raised 364.5 million dollars your campaign in the dnc last month uh record for a monthly haul apparently how are you going to spend it you want to go to dinner no i tell you what look um what i'm having to spend a lot of it on is to counter the lies that are being told by my by trump's campaign and and swift boaters out there a new pack but what i'm trying to do is spend most of that and by the way i think the average contribution was like 40 bucks we have over a million six hundred thousand people who contribute in the middle of this economic crisis somewhere between five ten fifteen dollars i'd say that shows some genuine enthusiasm about wanting to make sure that we have a chance of becoming president united states and so what i will spend most of it doing is trying to explain to the american people how i want to unite the country what i want to do to make the country better why i'm so confident we can do it why i'm so confident that we can bring the country together and be in a better position than before this crisis occurred because there's been so many fissures exposed as a consequence of what's happened that people are now realizing my lord i didn't know that people in that circumstance didn't have that kind of help i didn't know whatever and so i think we have an enormous opportunity to bring the country together and once again lead the world and you've heard me say it a hundred times not just by the example of our power but the power of our example thank you also very much for taking the time thank thank you guys i know you always ask a hostile question but go ahead i think so uh you said and you had said recently uh you said that you warned president trump in january that there was going to be a pandemic and what needed to be done if you knew that then why were you still hosting crowded campaign rallies in march now what i talked about was not what had to be done what i said you got to take this seriously you've got to insist that we have access to wuhan insist that we have access in china to find out for ourselves we had 44 people from cdc there you cannot continue to talk about the president of china saying he's done a marvelous job he's doing a great a great job when it got up to march i kept saying look you've got to invoke and you remember i think i was the first i may be mistaken person calling about the defense production act we don't have enough of the i it's amazing we use a phrase like ppe and the public knows what that is now but protective equipment and gear and ventilators use that authority use it to go out there now and don't wait and don't wait to talk about the need for us to have masks and don't wait to talk about that's when i what i talked about and then i began to lay out for him he we actually had a conversation i can't remember when it was i think it was march maybe it was april and that range and i said he said biden wants to help i want to talk to him so i talked to him i laid out what i thought should be done to be able to reopen safely and the things we should do and he was very polite he listened and he said he'd think about it and that was the end of it and so what i would begin to become really clear is that as the science began to show that this was able to spread much more easily than people thought two two issues was a pandemic coming and how did it most how what's the most the way it did the most damage and as that became clear and clear we concluded that we just can't continue to have these large rallies and you know think about it here we are the rest of the world the places that have done extremely well in terms of dealing with this coveted crisis around the world you know we have the five largest countries in europe have a population larger than the united states of america yet we're in month of august we're losing a thousand lives a day and they're losing 57 a day combined combined all of them combined so i just don't as we learn more and we did learn more and why by march and april we knew a whole heck of a lot more why weren't we doing what needed to be done why are we being told that don't we have plenty of protective gear and the one the one big thing that i did push a lot on i wasn't the only one was on the need for testing and tracing and moving rapidly to make sure that you had the capacity to test and trace before it got so out of control we need to do that now but here's the thing i'll end with this i apologize for keeping you oh well [Music] the thing that i i just don't quite understand is when it's clear that some of the things that the president says are simply not true relating to this crisis and when enormous pressure is put on professionals in the administration from the cdc to nih across the board why do we think god willing when we get a vaccine that is good works why do we think the public's going to line up to be able to take the being willing to take the injection we've lost so much confidence the american people in what's said because we're finding out again today plasma well that doesn't quite work the way we're told it was a hell of a lot of pressure put on that person to say that this president has said so many things that are untrue that are just wrong in order to do anything he looks at in one way if the market stock market is high and it's moving and we're reducing the number of people who are in real trouble economically then it doesn't matter what i say that's the objective that's the objective the objective is to keep the american people safe so we can begin to get back to normal rebuilding our economy and bringing back economic growth thank you all very much you,b good afternoon folk welcome to the queen theater PRON be here today to talk about a crisis a crisis be feel all across the united states of america and jill and i have just be brief as PRON know in this room by PRON public health and education expert about what PRON be go to take to be able to reopen

be go back to school too as a teacher jill be an educator and PRON will be the first one to tell PRON that this should be a season of promise for PRON country time when crass classroom be crackle with the possibility the new year student hope and the uh all about the future but this year PRON be face the most difficult circumstance and PRON be see an awful lot of heart and a lot of grit from PRON educator PRON student and to try to rise to the occasion here but PRON government have not come up to that bar i have not show much grit at all or determination let PRON be clear if president trump and PRON administration have do PRON job early on with this crisis american school would be open and to be open safely instead american family all across this country be pay the price for PRON failure and PRON administration failure like many of PRON because PRON be all reporter PRON also have a lot of friend and PRON have child and PRON be probably hear the same thing PRON be hear throughout this pandemic PRON be struggle to figure out how to do the right thing but PRON be worried PRON be worried like the devil PRON uh what do PRON mean for PRON kid be be this set PRON child education back beyond just a semester what impact will PRON have how PRON child be go to how be PRON child go to catch up what if what if PRON be not do enough to help PRON child succeed all those question the self doubt that be be engage president trump may not think be this a national emergency but i think go back to school for million of child and the impact on PRON family and the community be a national emergency i believe that be what PRON be protect PRON student PRON educator PRON community get PRON school open safely and effectively this be a national emergency but president trump still do not have any real plan for how to open PRON school safely no real plan for how to help parent feel secure for PRON child PRON be offer nothing but failure and delusion from the start to finish the american family and PRON child be pay the price for PRON failure failure to take this virus seriously early on in january and february and PRON spread around the globe failure to take step PRON need back in march and april to get this pandemic under control to institute widespread testing and trace to control the spread failure to provide clear national science base guideline to state and local authority and failure to model even basic responsibility like socially distance and wear a mask and failure to make sure educator and administrator have the equipment the resource and the training PRON need to open safely under the circumstance PRON find now donald trump and betsy devos have not secretary devos have not step up and PRON be all see the result million of student be now start the new school year in the same way PRON finish the last one at home at home parent be do PRON good but more and more be find PRON at wit end struggle to balance work and child care and education dutie educational duty or worry about PRON lost paycheck and how PRON make end meet while try to keep PRON kid on track with remote learning educator be take on countless hour of additional training to learn how to use remote learning tool so PRON can still be there for PRON student but PRON be worried about all the kid who use to count in our on PRON school all those child who need PRON so badly and particularly those child who need more than the education PRON provide PRON meal and safe place to spend the day PRON know PRON be all concerned about make sure covert do not further exacerbate the disparity the disparity that already have exist in PRON educational system for so many poor child and in so many community of color PRON be unacceptable and PRON can not go on like this PRON all want PRON school to reopen safely with a plan that prioritize the health of PRON student and PRON educator and staff alike i lay out PRON plan back in june and july a road map for how to open reopen safely and effectively PRON can read PRON by go to joebiden com PRON need straightforward common sense solution but trump refuse to act starve school of the need funding funding PRON need now now PRON need PRON begin of the summer now trump fema director be cut school loose just yesterday fema announce that PRON be not after help three district i think PRON be three PRON announce that PRON be not go to help pay for cloth mask other ppe or for school setting clean those basic health need or sanitize everything from the laboratory to the classroom and safety cost for school that do not qualify for emergency assistance this be emergency mr president this be an emergency and donald trump and PRON fema should treat PRON as one if PRON president of the day i direct fema to make sure that PRON kid k through get full access to disaster relief and emergency assistance under the stafford act PRON would make sure that ppe and sanitation supply for school qualify as emergency protective measure which be the phrase PRON use to fully be eligible for federal assistance on top of that PRON would be work with the leader of congress now today to pass emergency package for school so PRON have the resource PRON need in order to be able to open safely money for ventilation i hear that a lot when i have all those health care worker those health care expert up on the up on the zoom money for ventilation other health measure but also more money to hire more teacher every recommendation PRON get be PRON be go to be PRON should be divide into pod small class small class mean more educator be need keep class socially distance small money for more psychologist and counselor i introduce legislation a long time ago call for i introduce i propose legislation a long time ago PRON have one one school psychology every child in school and the health care the mental health that PRON child need now the anxiety PRON be feel at home in go to school not be able to go to school the nation superintendent of school have estimate that PRON will need at least billion dollar to support k school throughout the year for safe reopen and PRON need the money to hire educator as well of PRON for as for PRON four year college and university for community college for hbcus for minority serve institution democratic leader be ready to get this do PRON have already propose legislation mr president where be PRON where be PRON why be not PRON work on this PRON need emergency support fund for PRON school and PRON need PRON now mr president that be PRON job that be PRON job that be what PRON should be focus on now get PRON kid back to school safely keep school safely able to remain open once PRON stay once PRON open not whip up fear and division not incite violence in PRON street get off twitter and start talk to the congressional leader in both party invite PRON to the oval office the oval office and stop PRON boast about never seem to what PRON PRON PRON can do anything PRON be PRON PRON always talk about PRON ability to negotiate negotiate a deal a deal for somebody other than PRON now PRON be happy to take question PRON may have i guess staff be go to call on whoever follow fire away thank PRON mr vice president uh two quick question for PRON if i may uh first ahead of PRON trip to kenosha wisconsin tomorrow last week PRON run mate senator harris say that the officer who shoot jacob blake base on what PRON have see should be charge do PRON agree with PRON and do PRON also believe the same for the officer who be involve in the death of briana taylor i think PRON should let the judicial system work PRON way i do think there be a minimum need to be charge the officer and as well as brianna taylor and uh i may add by the way i think what happen in portland where a one of the trump guy ride along in van and cite response shoot rubber bullet i guess or paintball apparently there be someone shoot by someone in the crowd with a bullet kill i think that person should meet the legal requirement that whatever that call for PRON should be investigate and PRON should follow through on what need to be do let the judicial system work let PRON make sure justice be do and just uh quickly on a different topic there be a new book by the new york times michael schmidt that say that when president trump make an unannounced visit to walter reed hospital in vice president pence be tell to be on standby to take over in case president trump have to receive anesthesia penn say last night that PRON do not recall be tell that as vice president be PRON ever tell to be on standby or give PRON know a any kind of special alert when president obama be go in for a medical appointment and i also just wonder whether PRON have any concern about the fact that that walter reed visit that president trump make PRON do not follow PRON know prior protocol about presidential visit for medical examination PRON be not go to speculate on what PRON mean always what i can say be that nothing this administration do be normal and so PRON be not be a facetious when i say that so who in god name know what PRON be all about i just do not know i do not know and PRON be not go to speculate PRON will let the expert do that and so and the only time that i have be on notice be when the president be out of the country and PRON be in the country that not that i should wait for something to be immediately be aware of anything but that that that be something that would may be call for PRON be not call for thank PRON thank PRON mr vice president on this visit to kenosha tomorrow local democratic official include the governor have previously discourage president trump from visit and just yesterday the president of the local naacp say PRON do not want to see either of the candidate include PRON visit that this be such a sensitive situation in the city why be now the right time for PRON to go to kenosha and what do PRON hope to accomplish tomorrow well i have uh PRON have speak to all the leader up there and although i have an outstanding call with the governor PRON have deal with the staff because and there be be overwhelming request that i do come because what PRON want to do be PRON get to heal PRON get to put thing together bring people together and so PRON purpose in go will be to do just that to be a positive influence on what be go on talk about what nee be do and try to see if there be a beginning of a mechanism to bring the folk together PRON have to heal this be about make sure that that PRON move then PRON move forward and so i PRON have get advice from sit member of the congress in the senate as well to go and that i should go PRON be not go to do anything other than meet with meeting with community leader as well as business people and other folk in law enforcement and to see uh PRON start to talk about what have to be do not PRON be not go to tell kenosha what PRON have to do but PRON have to do together the idea that PRON be say PRON know PRON have the president encourage people to retreat to PRON corner and keep this this moving be just a mistake PRON have spend PRON whole life include in this city PRON be in right now bring people together bring the community and and police officer together bring business leader and civic leader together and so that be PRON purpose in go and on the fact that PRON be travel to wisconsin at all i believe this be only the third time in the last few month since the onset of the pandemic that PRON will be on a plane PRON have talk about how PRON want to make sure PRON follow all the advice of PRON doctor in term of campaign safely but the question PRON keep hear from voter from other be why be not PRON out there more PRON may be aware the president be call to question PRON campaign schedule today how far be PRON willing to push the envelope of what be safe in order to get PRON message out and to be among the voter speak to PRON directly well i think PRON message be get out base on what the all the polling datum show and the million of people who have watch what PRON have have to say and the circumstance which PRON have say PRON but i would like to get out more but i think a president have a responsibility to set example set the right example for how to get out not go out and not wear a mask and not to have large crowd of people stand next to one of PRON not wear mask not be a potential cauldron for a significant outbreak of covid and so what PRON have do be PRON have meet with via via what i do this morning with the medical expert and so PRON have work out a protocol where how i get in the plane what kind of plane i get on how PRON be sanitized where how i engage people PRON be like when PRON be engage all of PRON everywhere i go PRON be always at a safe distance and everybody be wear mask and the vast majority of people that PRON be meet with have be that come into PRON home and staff and the like PRON be all test as well so PRON be just try to set the example wear the protective gear the mask which i have with PRON PRON be able at this distance to take PRON off number one number two make sure that PRON proceed in a way with adequate social distancing and do PRON the right way and last quickly PRON announce the format and the moderator of the presidential debate today nbc kristen welker batting cleanup for that last presidential debate be there anything PRON say PRON will participate be there anything that could dissuade PRON from participate and how have PRON begin to prepare well PRON have begin to prepare by by go over what the president have say multiple lie PRON be PRON be tell what PRON would love to have be a crawler at the bottom of the screen a fact checker PRON know PRON speak uh if PRON really want to do something i think that would make a great great debate if everything both of PRON say be instantly fact check by by an agree to group of people out there that PRON PRON move forward but that probably would not get very far in the debate now PRON be look forward to debate the president and i uh and PRON be go to uh lay out as clearly as i can what i think PRON have to do to bring this country back and build PRON back better and PRON be look forward to the debate thank PRON mr vice president um one of the thing that PRON have hear a lot from voter across the country be that a lot of PRON be worried and concerned about some of the ongoing violence PRON have see in city in this country include the situation in kenosha wisconsin where PRON be head PRON be curious obviously PRON be not president now and donald trump be but PRON be curious if PRON be president what would PRON do to ensure that people be keep safe in situation like these first of all i would not incite violence PRON would condemn PRON when PRON occur i would move to look the vast majority a police officer good decent honorable woman and man PRON pin on that shield every morning and PRON have a right to go home that night safely the vast majority but just those who be not good cop PRON be all the police PRON have deal with PRON whole life and PRON have be deal with PRON have get overwhelming support from law enforcement through PRON whole career PRON be the one that want to get rid of the bad cop even more than anybody else do because PRON reflect on PRON number one number two i would make sure everybody understand if i be president that any violence any violence protest be a right and free speech be a right but to engage in violence burn loot the rest in the name of protesting be wrong and the person should be hold accountable for PRON action and so um what PRON would be do be PRON would be bring people together in the white house right now PRON would be have that police commission set up PRON would have law enforcement at the table PRON would have the community at the table PRON would have people and say how do PRON get through this what do PRON do to deal with this because i believe the vast majority of the community at large as well as law enforcement want to straighten thing out not inflame thing but this president keep throw gasoline in the fire every place PRON go i notice and i do not watch much of PRON but i watch the report from all of PRON not all from the press and uh PRON know when PRON be ask about what should be do with regard to a young man shoot in the back seven time in front of PRON child i do not hear much of anything come from PRON what should PRON be do about and PRON go down down the line so i wish PRON would take responsibility as much as PRON would like to be run against somebody else PRON be run against PRON joe biden and the fact be that PRON be not act very responsibly thank PRON mr vice president PRON have PRON have ask PRON be sorry be i over here okay PRON have outline PRON school PRON plan to reopen school safely but what about what happen in the interim right now million of parent across the country be face this very impossible task of try to work full time and help PRON child full time to learn virtually what be PRON message to these parent and what can PRON do to help PRON while PRON work to reopen school help be on the way PRON have lay out a clear plan for child care a clear plan for start early education as well so three and four and five year old be in school and like but PRON be not president right now what PRON should be do be PRON should be provide for more help for people who in fact be try to juggle the choice between do i stay home with PRON three four or five year old and take care of PRON in the middle of this covet problem or do i go to work and earn a salary what do i do and so that be why PRON have i have a major initiative to deal with child care and eld care so people can be adequately pay to come and take care of folk child as well as the elderly that PRON may be take care of a parent a a a husband or wife may be take care of as well as make sure that those folk be able to get back to work and that be why focus on day care center and make sure PRON be safe and healthy now be equally as important as deal with almost as equally important as deal with school and PRON should be provide all of the ppe and all of the safety that be necessary in sanitary capacity to allow PRON to open hundred of PRON have be open because some state have go in and do that there should be universal guidance come from the president united states of america there should be basic standard to how in fact and what circumstance PRON can safely open a daycare center PRON can safely safely open a child care center in addition to that in the future the idea this have bring home a number of glare problem PRON have in america this whole pandemic and what be happen in term of job the idea that PRON be in a situation where PRON have so many parent who have to make the difficult choice as a single parent or both work parent to decide whether one give up PRON salary and stay home with a child under the age of five or six and or somehow leave PRON with somebody that be not particularly qualified and go to work so PRON can earn a living be a choice that be not PRON should not be make PRON be the only industrialize country in the world that force people to make that kind of choice so there should be no one should have to pay more than seven percent of PRON income income to provide for child care and be able to go to work this be something that be a major element of PRON build back well program but in the meantime in the meantime the most important thing that can be do be have cdc issue really straightforward guideline on what circumstance PRON should be able to open up a PRON day care center or PRON child care center now and there should be clear standard and state should have the wherewithal to be able to go out and inspect those facility now but PRON know one thing i have not mention and i think PRON warrant mention PRON know one of the thing PRON do remember well when PRON inherit the great recession and PRON be go into the tank head off the cliff for uh head to a depression i be able to convince three republicans to change PRON vote and PRON end up with the so call recovery act which spend over billion dollar in month keep PRON from go into depression but what do PRON do PRON spend almost PRON spend billion of dollar make sure that state be able to maintain PRON essential worker everyone from PRON fire department PRON school teacher PRON doctor PRON nurse PRON public hospital now what be happen this republican administration will not support that and the republican leadership in the united states senate will not support PRON so what be happen PRON do not have that help PRON be not out there and state be in real trouble and to quote PRON good friend mitch mcconnell PRON say let the state go bankrupt state have to balance PRON budget under the law communitie county city PRON have to balance PRON budget there be a reason why the federal government be able to run a deficit to compensate in time of real economic crisis and what be happen nothing nothing and guess what PRON come out of that recession with the the long spurt of economic growth of any administration in american history but these guy do not i do not see and i could go on business look at the money that be pass under the care act for business small business be able to stay open PRON get ten of thousand of PRON go out of business many of PRON permanently why because the money do not get to small business PRON be not PRON be not open PRON should be deal with those those business that have be burn out and those and damage PRON should be provide federal help for those business to get back on PRON foot but this administration seem to think PRON be all of a sudden going to go away like angel dust be go to be spray around everything will be okay i just do not get PRON PRON have to know well PRON have to know better and PRON have an example just the last administration how much good PRON can do and how much growth PRON can generate i just do not get these guy i really do not not a joke PRON have be do this a long time but PRON have never see a president lack as much leadership unwilling on inability to make a deal and PRON get about PRON be tell the reason why PRON can not get anything do in the republican congress be member of the united states senate say under no circumstance will PRON raise the deficit at all well that be wonderful and PRON be in a position PRON be in now look at other country PRON be do one hell of a lot better and yet PRON still have over what be up to people dead over million be PRON million whatever the number be that have contract the disease and no end in sight PRON be just irresponsible talk about a know nothing congress on the republican side no nothing president i mean i do not get PRON i really do not get PRON but PRON be go to change come january god willing sir what do PRON say to the teacher who be afraid to return to the classroom even if the safety protocol that PRON have propose be in place well i say that i understand PRON be concerned because so many of the teacher also have other pre existing condition that lend PRON to the fact that if PRON be to contract the covet the covert disease coven that PRON would be very susceptible to be in real trouble so PRON be understandable why PRON be do PRON but the first thing to do be make sure that all the protective capacity that PRON have available to PRON be make available and then make choice about whether or not let the district make choice about whether or not PRON open fully whether PRON rotate and whether or not those teacher be able to be able to teach from home and remote learning but i PRON be really understandable why PRON would look look what be happen in in this uh covett crisis so far a hundred million i think a hundred thousand people have die who be above the age of sixty five hundred thousand out of the two hundred and some that have die be not two hundred something yet PRON be or whatever PRON be now estimate i hear today that estimate range from two uh two significant university one be go to be as many as i think and another one say by december i do not know that but that be PRON know PRON be go to go higher and so i just do not uh i do not understand why PRON be a political problem what be the politic about not be willing to go in and help provide the protective capacity for people to be able to go back to work and do not go to school i i i i just do not i can not fathom PRON thank PRON mr vice president um PRON talk today about reopen school i want to ask PRON about something PRON say last week about rio the potential of have to shut down the economy again PRON be ask if PRON would be willing to shut PRON down if PRON health expert advise PRON to do so PRON say quote i will be prepared to do whatever PRON take and that PRON would listen to the scientist but PRON be curious how PRON would do that at a federal level and how PRON would balance that call to shut down potentially if PRON have economic adviser say PRON do this again PRON could plunge the country into an even deep economic crisis well look i know PRON be tired of hear PRON say this PRON have be say PRON uh since uh last january the idea that PRON be go to be able to get the economy back on track without get cover under control be completely counter intuitive PRON be not there PRON can not happen so unless PRON be able to deal with the disease and drastically cut PRON impact on people confidence of be able to either go to work or walk into a business or do business then PRON do not matter a lot there be go to be no need in PRON view to be able to shut down the whole economy i get ask by david muir a question if i be ask to shut everything down i take that as a generic question if be i go to follow the science i be go to insist and i insist now without any authority that every responsible person in this country when PRON be out in public or not with a cohort that PRON have live with because PRON know PRON have not spread PRON husband wife etc that PRON wear a mask that PRON wear a mask and keep socially distance PRON can take a mask off when PRON be foot away but i would follow i would really really make the case and by the way when i find these folk talk about PRON freedom i talk about patriotism why do PRON wear a mask to protect PRON neighbor to keep someone else from get sick and maybe die i call that patriotic this be the united states of america every generation have make sacrifice to help other in moment of crisis but so PRON do not see PRON PRON have suggest there would be some kind of a federal mandate about mask and now PRON be say no no no no here be what i suggest be i would ask every person in authority there be a question whether or not a president under the constitution could mandate every more mass and remember all during the primary PRON would have a lot of people tell PRON i would buy executive order do PRON be a constitutionalist PRON know PRON can not do thing the constitution do not allow PRON the power to do what i would be do be put as much pressure as i could on every governor every senator PRON be excited every mayor every county executive every local official and everyone in business putting pressure on PRON to say what PRON be do be irresponsible make sure PRON wear a mask and maintain social distancing and the vast majority of the american people accept that notion one more quick campaign question PRON raise million dollar PRON campaign in the dnc last month uh record for a monthly haul apparently how be PRON go to spend PRON PRON want to go to dinner no i tell PRON what look um what PRON be have to spend a lot of PRON on be to counter the lie that be be tell by PRON by trump campaign and and swift boater out there a new pack but what PRON be try to do be spend most of that and by the way i think the average contribution be like buck PRON have over a million six hundred thousand people who contribute in the middle of this economic crisis somewhere between five ten fifteen dollar PRON would say that show some genuine enthusiasm about want to make sure that PRON have a chance of become president united states and so what i will spend most of PRON do be try to explain to the american people how i want to unite the country what i want to do to make the country better why PRON be so confident PRON can do PRON why PRON be so confident that PRON can bring the country together and be in a well position than before this crisis occur because there be be so many fissure expose as a consequence of what be happen that people be now realize PRON lord i do not know that people in that circumstance do not have that kind of help i do not know whatever and so i think PRON have an enormous opportunity to bring the country together and once again lead the world and PRON have hear PRON say PRON a hundred time not just by the example of PRON power but the power of PRON example thank PRON also very much for take the time thank thank PRON guy i know PRON always ask a hostile question but go ahead i think so uh PRON say and PRON have say recently uh PRON say that PRON warn president trump in january that there be go to be a pandemic and what need to be do if PRON know that then why be PRON still host crowd campaign rally in march now what i talk about be not what have to be do what i say PRON get to take this seriously PRON have get to insist that PRON have access to wuhan insist that PRON have access in china to find out for PRON PRON have people from cdc there PRON can not continue to talk about the president of china say PRON be do a marvelous job PRON be do a great a great job when PRON get up to march i keep say look PRON have get to invoke and PRON remember i think i be the first i may be mistaken person call about the defense production act PRON do not have enough of the i PRON be amazing PRON use a phrase like ppe and the public know what that be now but protective equipment and gear and ventilator use that authority use PRON to go out there now and do not wait and do not wait to talk about the need for PRON to have mask and do not wait to talk about that be when i what i talk about and then i begin to lay out for PRON PRON PRON actually have a conversation i can not remember when PRON be i think PRON be march maybe PRON be april and that range and i say PRON say biden want to help i want to talk to PRON so i talk to PRON i lay out what i think should be do to be able to reopen safely and the thing PRON should do and PRON be very polite PRON listen and PRON say PRON would think about PRON and that be the end of PRON and so what i would begin to become really clear be that as the science begin to show that this be able to spread much more easily than people think two two issue be a pandemic come and how do PRON most how what be the most the way PRON do the most damage and as that become clear and clear PRON conclude that PRON just can not continue to have these large rally and PRON know think about PRON here PRON be the rest of the world the place that have do extremely well in term of deal with this covet crisis around the world PRON know PRON have the five large country in europe have a population large than the united states of america yet PRON be in month of august PRON be lose a thousand live a day and PRON be lose a day combine combine all of PRON combine so i just do not as PRON learn more and PRON do learn more and why by march and april PRON know a whole heck of a lot more why be not PRON do what need to be do why be PRON be tell that do not PRON have plenty of protective gear and the one the one big thing that i do push a lot on i be not the only one be on the need for testing and trace and move rapidly to make sure that PRON have the capacity to test and trace before PRON get so out of control PRON need to do that now but here be the thing PRON will end with this i apologize for keep PRON oh well music the thing that i i just do not quite understand be when PRON be clear that some of the thing that the president say be simply not true relate to this crisis and when enormous pressure be put on professional in the administration from the cdc to nih across the board why do PRON think god willing when PRON get a vaccine that be good work why do PRON think the public be go to line up to be able to take the be willing to take the injection PRON have lose so much confidence the american people in what be say because PRON be find out again today plasma well that do not quite work the way PRON be tell PRON be a hell of a lot of pressure put on that person to say that this president have say so many thing that be untrue that be just wrong in order to do anything PRON look at in one way if the market stock market be high and PRON be move and PRON be reduce the number of people who be in real trouble economically then PRON do not matter what i say that be the objective that be the objective the objective be to keep the american people safe so PRON can begin to get back to normal rebuild PRON economy and bring back economic growth thank PRON all very much PRON
81,uBigQgyIPkE,biden,2020-09-03T04:25:23Z,Joe Biden's full campaign speech HD 8/31/2020,speech,that's why i'm speaking to you today the incumbent president is incapable of telling us the truth and capable of facing the facts and incapable of healing he doesn't want to shed light he wants to generate heat and he's stroking violence in our cities you know this is a tragic fact of the matter that about his perilous hour that how he's dealing with this trail of sour in our nation and now we have to stand against violence and every form it takes violence we've seen again and again and again of unwarranted police shooting excessive force seven bullets in the back of jacob blake knee on the neck of george floyd killing a brianna taylor in her own apartment violence of extremists and opportunists right-wing militias white supremacists vigilantes you know who infiltrate protests carrying weapons of war hoping to wreak havoc and to derail any hope and support for progress the senseless violence of looting and burning and destruction of property i want to make it absolutely clear something very clear about all of this rioting is not protesting looting is not protesting setting fires is not protesting none of this is protesting it's lawlessness plain and simple and those who do it should be prosecuted violence will not bring change it will only bring destruction it's wrong in every way it divides instead of unites destroys businesses only hurts the working families that serve the community it makes things worse across the board not better no it's not what dr king or john lewis taught and it must end fires are burning and we have a president who fans the flames rather than fighting the flames but we must not burn we have to build this president long ago forfeited any moral leadership in this country he can't stop the violence because for years he's fomented it you know he may believe mouthing the words law and order makes him strong but his failure to call on his own supporters to stop acting as an armed militia in this country shows how weak he is does anyone believe there'll be less violence in america if donald trump is reelected we need justice in america we need safety in america we're facing multiple crises crisis under donald trump have kept multiplying covert economic devastation unwarranted police violence emboldened white nationalists a reckoning on race declining faith and the birth and the of the right american future there's no reason why we can't just do so much more than we're doing the common thread the incoming president who makes things worse not better an incumbent president who shows chaos rather than providing order an incumbent president who fails in the basic duty of the job which is to advance the truth that all of us know that we're all born with the right to life liberty and pursuit of happiness that's right all of us the moms and dads in scranton where i grew up who have worked and scraped for everything they've ever gotten in life the auto worker in michigan who still makes the best automobile in the world a single mom in ohio working three jobs just to stay afloat will do anything for her child retired veteran in florida who gave everything he had to this country and now just wants us to honor the promises made to him lord and taylor sales person who just lost their job a store closing after 194 years in business nurses and doctors in wisconsin have seen so much sickness so much death in the past six months and they wonder how much more how much more can they take but still they muster up the courage to take care of those patients in this pandemic while risking their own lives researchers in minnesota who woke up this morning determined to find a breakthrough in treating cancer and will do the same thing tomorrow and the day after and the day after because she'll never give up white black latino asian american native americans everybody i'm in this campaign for you no matter your color no matter your zip code no matter your politics when i think of the presidency i don't think about myself it isn't about my brand it's about you the american people we can do better and we have to do better i promise you this we will do better you know the road back begins now in this campaign you know me you know my heart you know my story my family story ask yourself do i look like a radical socialist with a soft spot for rioters really i want a safe america safe from coven safe from crime and looting safe from racially motivated violence safe from bad cops let me be crystal clear safe from four more years of donald trump i look at this violence and i see lives and communities and the dreams of small businesses being destroyed and the opportunity for real progress on issues of race and police reform and justice being put to the test donald trump looks at this violence and he sees a political lifeline having failed to protect this nation from the virus that has killed more than 180 000 americans so far trump post on all caps tweet screaming law and order to save his campaign one of his closest political advisers in the white house doesn't even bother the speaking code she just comes out and she says it quote the more chaos violence the better it is for trump's reelection let's think about that this is a sitting president of the united states of america he's supposed to be protecting this country but instead he's rooting for chaos and violence the simple truth is donald trump failed to protect america so now he's trying to scare america since donald trump and mike prince can't run on the record that has seen more american deaths to a virus this virus then the nation suffered in every war since korea combined since they can't run on their economy that has seen more people lose their jobs than any time since the great depression since they can't run on the simple proposition of sending our children safely back to school since they have no agenda or a vision for a second term trump pence are running on this and i find it fascinating quote you won't be safe in joe biden's america and what's their proof the violence we're seeing in donald trump's america these are not images of some imagined joe biden america in the future these are images of donald trump's america today he keeps telling you if only he was president it wouldn't happen if he was president he keeps telling us that he was president you'd feel safe well he is president whether he knows it or not and it is happening it's getting worse and you know why because donald trump adds fuel to every fire because he refuses to even acknowledge that there is a racial justice problem in america because he won't stand up to any form of violence he's got no problem with right-wing militia white supremacists and vigilantes with assault weapons often better armed than the police often in the middle of the violence at the protesters and aiming it there and because tens of millions of americans simply don't trust this president to respect their rights to hear their concerns or to protect them it doesn't have to be this way when president obama and i were in the white house we had to defend federal property we did it we didn't see it you didn't see us whipping up fears around the deployment of secret federal troops we just did our job and the federal property was protected when president obama and i were in office we didn't look at cities as democratic or republican run these are american cities but trump doesn't see him himself as president for all of america frankly i believe if i were president today the country would be safer and we've seen a lot less violence and here's why i have said we must address the issue of racial injustice i've personally spoken to george floyd's family in the jacob blake's family i know their pain and so do you i know the justice they seek and so do you they've told us none of this violence respects or honors george or jacob i believe we can bring these these these folks fighting for racial justice to the table i've worked with police in this country for many years i know most cops are good decent people i know how they risk their lives every time they put that shield on and go out the door i'm confident i can bring the police to the table as well i'd make sure every mayor and governor had the support they needed from the federal government but i wouldn't be looking to use the united states military against our own people if i were president my language would be less divisive i'd be looking to lower the temperature in this country not raise it i'd be looking to unite the nation but look if donald trump wants to ask the question who will keep you safer as president let's answer that question first some simple facts when i was vice president violent crime fell 15 in this country we did it without chaos and disorder and yes we did it with democratic mayors in most of the major cities in this country the murder right now is up 26 across the nation this year under donald trump do you really feel safer under donald trump covet has taken this year just since the outbreak has taken more than 100 years look here's the lives it's just it's when you think about it more lives this year than any other year for the past 100 years more than 180 000 lives in just six months an average of a thousand people dying every day in the month of august do you really feel safer under donald trump mr trump you want to talk about fear do you know what people are afraid of in america afraid they're going to get coveted they're afraid they're going to get sick and die and that is no small part it's because of you we're now on track to more than hundred thousand deaths in this country due to coving more than one hundred thousand seniors have lost their lives of the virus more cops have died from covert this year than have been killed on patrol nearly one in six small businesses closed in this country today do you really feel safer under trump what about trump's plan to destroy the affordable care act and with it the protections for pre-existing conditions it impacts more than 100 million americans does that make you feel safer or how about trump's plan to defund social security the social security administration's chief actuary just released a report saying that if a plan like the one trump is proposing goes into effect the social security trust fund would be and i quote permanently deplete it by the middle of calendar year 2023 with no ability to pay benefits thereafter put it plainly trump's plan would wipe out social security period you feel safer and more secure now the fear that reigns under this president doesn't stop at our shores the kremlin has put bounties on the heads of american soldiers and instead of telling vladimir putin that there'll be no putting up with this that there'll be a heavy price to pay they dare touch an american soldier this president doesn't even bring up the subject in his multiple phone calls with putin been reported that russian forces just attacked american troops in syria injuring our service members did you hear the president say a single word did he lift one finger never before has an american president played such a subservient role to a russian leader it's not only dangerous it's humiliating and embarrassing for the rest of the world to see it weakens us not even american troops can feel safer under trump donald trump's role as a bystander in his own presidency extends to the economic plan and pain the plan he doesn't have and the pain being felt by millions of americans he said this week and i quote you better vote for me or you're going to have the greatest depression you've ever seen does he not understand and see the tens of millions of people who've had to file for unemployment this year so far the people who won't be able to make next month's rent payment the people who lost wages while the cost of groceries have gone up dramatically president obama and i stopped the depression in 2009 we took a bad economy that was falling and turned it around trump took a good economy and drove it back into the ditch through his failure to get coveted under control his failure to pull together the leaders in congress his failure to deliver real relief to working people has made our country economic situation so much worse so much worse than it had to be we talk about safety and security we should talk about basic security of being able to look your child in the eye and tell them everything's going to be okay don't worry honey we're not going to lose our home we're going to be able to put food in the table it's going to be okay it's a job of a president i've laid out an agenda for economic recovery that will restore a sense of security for working families we won't just build things back the way they were before we're going to build them back better with good paying jobs building our nation's roads bridges solar rays windmills with investments in our health care and child care workers so they get the pay and dignity they deserve while easing the financial burdens on millions of families with a clean energy strategy that is a place for the energy workers right here in western pennsylvania i am not banning frackie let me say that again i am not banning frackie no matter how many times donald trump lies about me this future the future that's what this is all about you know we hear donald trump's self-centered rants and rifts but the voice of americans should be heard the one you should listen to is julia jackson the mother of jacob blake hers is a voice of courage character and wisdom looking at the damage that has been done in her city she said quote the violence and destruction doesn't reflect my son or my family these are the words of a mom a mother whose son had just been shot seven times in front of his children badly injured paralyzed perhaps permanently and even as she seeks justice for her son she's pleading for an end to the violence and for this nation to heal she said she was praying for her son then she said something to me that that surprised me she said she was praying for all police officers she was already been praying for america even before her son was shot she's publicly asked all of us to examine our hearts citizens elected officials the police all of us and then she said this quote we need healing more than anything that's what we need to do as a nation we need to heal the current president wants you to live in fear he advertises himself as a figure of order he isn't and he's not been part of the solution thus far he's part of the problem the problem i as president will give you my all resolved to stop i'll deal with the virus i'll deal with the economic crisis and i'll work to bring equality and opportunity to everyone we've arrived at a moment in this campaign we all knew including the press in front of me knew we'd get to the moment when donald trump would be so desperate he'd do anything to hold on to power donald trump has been a toxic presence in our nation for four years poisoning how we talk to one another poisoning how we treat one another poisoning the values this nation has always held dear poisoning our very democracy now is just a little over 60 days we have a decision to make will we rid ourselves of this toxin or will we make a permanent part we make it a permanent part of our nation's character you know as americans i'm confident we believe in honesty and decency treating everyone with dignity and respect giving everyone a fair shot leaving no one behind giving hate no safe harbor and demonizing no one we hope to now always recognize there's something bigger than ourselves as we're about trump doesn't seem to believe in any of that look i've said it before and i'll keep saying it america is an idea it's the most powerful idea in the history of the world and i believe it beats in the hearts of the people of this country all men and women are created equal and they deserve to be treated equally trump has sought to remake this nation in his image selfish angry dark and divisive this is not who we are at her best america has always been and if i have anything to do with it will be again generous confident an optimistic nation full of hope and resolve donald trump is determined to instill fear in america that's what his entire campaign for the president has come down to fear but i believe americans are stronger than that i believe will be guided by the words of pope john paul ii words drawn from the scriptures be not afraid be not afraid fear never builds the future but hope does and building the future was america does what we've always done in fact it's what we have done best and continue to do best this is the united states of america there's not a single thing beyond our capacity when we decide to do it together so let's get together i want to thank you all may god bless you and may god protect our troops,b that be why PRON be speak to PRON today the incumbent president be incapable of tell PRON the truth and capable of face the fact and incapable of healing PRON do not want to shed light PRON want to generate heat and PRON be stroke violence in PRON city PRON know this be a tragic fact of the matter that about PRON perilous

PRON have a president who fan the flame rather than fight the flame but PRON must not burn PRON have to build this president long ago forfeit any moral leadership in this country PRON can not stop the violence because for year PRON be foment PRON PRON know PRON may believe mouth the word law and order make PRON strong but PRON failure to call on PRON own supporter to stop act as an armed militia in this country show how weak PRON be do anyone believe there will be less violence in america if donald trump be reelect PRON need justice in america PRON need safety in america PRON be face multiple crisis crisis under donald trump have keep multiply covert economic devastation unwarranted police violence embolden white nationalist a reckoning on race decline faith and the birth and the of the right american future there be no reason why PRON can not just do so much more than PRON be do the common thread the incoming president who make thing bad not well an incumbent president who show

83,ISZ2wBK_Bx8,biden,2020-09-04T18:12:38Z,Biden Speaks on the State of the U.S. Economy in Campaign Speech in Delaware,speech,for a chance not a handout just a fair shot at a good job a safe place to live and a better life to pass down to their kids this is a special place for the biden family my daughter ashley a social worker was a caseworker here helping young people who are aging out of foster care when my son was the attorney general bo came here right here to learn more about job training programs for the those working toward a ged or certificate for a good paying job when i was senator and vice president there were plenty of econo economists i had around me to talk about every aspect of the economy but i always think about the people who walk through the doors here working people white black brown latino what are they doing are they okay i know if they're okay as they walk through these doors the economy was doing okay if they weren't okay we weren't doing well that's what we should be thinking about this latest jobs report but the report reinforces the worst fears and painful truths the economic inequities that began before the downturn have only worsened under this failed presidency when the crisis started we all hope for a few months of a shutdown would be followed by a rapid economic turnaround no one thought they'd lose their job for good or see small businesses shut down on moss that kind of recovery requires leadership we didn't have and still don't have and as a result economists are starting to call this recession a k-shaped recession which is a fancy phrase for what's wrong with everything about trump's presidency the k means those at the top are saying things go up and those in the middle and below are seeing things go down and get worse it's no surprise because that root of this is the fact that trump has mismanaged the covet crisis and that's why it's a k-shaped pandemic first the president's chaotic chaotic mismanagement of the pandemic they're still holding us back compared to other major industrial countries in europe and asia during the pandemic our unemployment rate is still more than double while other nations have only gone up by half why because the president has botched the covert response botched it badly i've said from the beginning we can't deal with an economic crisis until you beat the pandemic you can't have an economic comeback when almost a thousand americans die each day from covet when the death toll has reached about two hundred thousand when more than six million americans have been infected when million more worry about getting sick and dying as schools and businesses try to reopen we all know it didn't have to be this bad it didn't have to be this bad to begin with if the president just did his job if he just took the virus seriously early on in january and february as it spread around the globe if he just took the steps we needed back in march and april to institute widespread testing and tracing to control the virus if you provided clear national scientific based guidance to state and local authorities if you just set a good example like social distancing and wearing a mask it's not too much to ask it's almost like he doesn't care he doesn't affect him because it doesn't affect him or his class of friends anyone with a big enough checkbook can get rapid tests on demand if you don't you might have to wait in line for hours and wait for weeks to get your result if you can get them at all you have the kind of job where you can work from a laptop at home remotely risking getting covet is very small at work this job report shows that 37 million people reported teleworking in august but if you work in an assembly line or checkout counter or a meat packing plant or drive a truck or deliver packages you're much greater risk and the job report shows that more than 27 million workers reported that they couldn't work or lost hours because their employer had to close or lost business due to the pandemic if you can hire a private tutor or have a live-in child care you can balance being a parent and remote schooling if you can't you have to do your job and be a teacher all at once jill and i have held briefings on reopening school safety two days ago asking the question is we hear so many parents call and ask us educators who feel like they're in an impossible situation what are they supposed to do with our children when the president has made it so hard for schools to reopen safely what's the alternative when it's devastating to keep them isolated from their friends and their support systems i also said earlier this week to the uh shock of many that we lost more cops this year to covet than on patrol this reminder how an already dangerous job law enforcement has gotten more dangerous because of trump's mismanagement what made jeb what may be just as shocking is many other jobs have also become dangerous due to covet being a health care worker is now more dangerous than ever we've lost hundreds of them this year because they weren't protected from covent on the job meat packers more dangerous than ever so many have died due to getting covert at work work for waitresses and waiters and transit workers all become more dangerous with so many dying of coven ladies and gentlemen no matter what he says or what he claims you are not safer in donald trump's america you're not safe in donald trump's america where people are dying at a rate last seen when americans were fighting in world war ii donald trump's malpractice during this pandemic has made being a working american a life-for-death work and while there is a disproportionate impact on black latino and asian americans and native americans working class communities white working-class communities are being hit hard as well opioid deaths for example are up during the pandemic another crisis that trump continues to all but ignore in the meantime trump and his friends have strong views about what the rest of america should do quote cut unemployment benefits to force people to go back to their jobs end of quote to fund social security and eliminate obamacare in the middle of a pandemic and to quote reopen public schools without resources or guidance reopen main street business without protection for workers so corporations can continue to soar this is their plan second and similarly the economic pain remains unrelenting for millions of working people of every race and background aren't getting relief they need meanwhile well if they're doing just fine some better than ever this diversion of fortunes is unique to any recession in recent memory and the painful truth is we just have a president who just doesn't see it he doesn't feel it he doesn't understand he just doesn't care he thinks if the stock market is up then everything's fine if his wealthy friends and donors are doing well then everything's doing well if corporations see their evaluations rising then they must be hiring but the best economists know what i know i've learned growing up in scranton and clemont delaware up the road places where folks aren't invested in the market like wealthy americans a measure of our economic success is the quality of life of the american people and if your stock soars families teeter on the brink of hunger and homelessness and our president calls that success what does that say about what he values when you see the world in such a narrow prison it's no wonder he doesn't see nearly 30 million americans on unemployment one in six small businesses are that are closed right now he doesn't understand what life is like for people walking by their boarded up shops educators afraid that doing their job that the job they love will bring the virus home to the people they love or a parent searching for health insurance now that the furlough has turned into a layoff it's no wonder he doesn't see the single mom forced to wait in a three-hour food line so for the first time in her life so she can feed her family because she's now part of the one in six households with children that don't have enough to eat he wants us to believe that we're doing better to keep it up and not notice that this remains the worst economic situation since the great depression and our country face the historic divergence in our way of life which gets me my third and final point and what the american people really need to understand all pain and suffering stems from president trump's failure to lead his sheer inability and willingness to bring people together he likes to sign executive orders actions for photo ops but they're ill-conceived and could do more harm than good he says protecting renters from eviction that's what he's doing but he's not giving them any support to pay the rent when it comes due millions of americans all will be left with the terrible choice between eviction and living in the streets or paying back rent they simply don't have when there was an answer offered and rejected he says he's continuing to provide enhanced employment unemployment insurance payments but he cut the amount that everyone on it received leaves them on the edge when it runs out in a few weeks or sooner he should be doing his job of calling congressional leaders together immediately to get a deal and deliver real results for the american people this is the first president in the middle of a crisis i've never seen has called congress into the oval office if i were president that's what i do and i'd get it done like previous presidents presidents rentals food unemployment assistance tens of millions struggling americans student loan relief small business support and aid to schools and state governments that are going bankrupt and as long as this pandemic and the accompanying economic catastrophe persist no one no one should have their water or power cut off because they can't afford to pay the bill bottom line mr president do your job get off your golf course and out of the sand bunker call the leaders together in the oval office sit with them and make a deal make a deal that delivers for working americans and eases their anxiety and pain in july i laid out my build back better plan for an economy that works for everyone over the next three weeks i'll be laying out the sharp contrast my plan has with the president's non-plans i'll be asking american people three basic questions who can handle the pandemic who can keep their promises and who cares about and will fight for working families like the people here at west end throughout this pandemic they found their way to keep the center open safely and provide for critical services no one here has been laid off they adjusted their spaces for social distancing they started a lending program to help local businesses hair salons and other small businesses they continued their child care services which is critical for so many working families by pure courage heart and grit they never give up and they never give in as to pursue the full promise for america that's the story of the people of this community and this country that's who we are give ordinary americans just half a chance and they never let the country down they'll do extraordinary things they'll never let us down unlike the current president and unlike the current president i won't let you down either that's what this election is about helping people unite get together and move this country back in the direction that we can be there's nothing beyond our capacity nothing if we just do it together i thank you all i now take your questions i guess are you calling on people or how am i i don't have a list so you go ahead and call thank you sir uh this morning in reference to that article in the atlantic in a call convened by your campaign kazurakan said that uh the comments demonstrated that president trump's life is a testament to self selfless selfishness and that his soul is that of a coward you've talked about this as a different view of how you see the job as president but when you hear these remarks suckers losers recoiling from amputees what does it tell you about president trump's soul and the life he leads i'm going to try to be measured in my response if it's true and based on other things he said i believe the article is true i'd ask you all the rhetorical question how do you feel how would you feel if you had a kid in afghanistan right now how would you feel if you lost a son daughter husband wife how would you feel for real i know that's not your job to express that feeling but you know you know in your heart you know in your gut it's deplorable it's deplorable as i've said many times i'll say again these folks are the backbone of america they're the heart the soul the grit that's what patriotism is about i probably just never been as disappointed in my whole career with a leader that i've worked with president or otherwise that if the article is true and it appears to be based on other things he said it is absolutely damnable it is a disgrace on a somewhat related topic what would you say to the supporters of the q a and the people who believe in that conspiracy what they think is true about america that there's sex trafficking and conspiracy against the president trump and what would you say to president trump for not rejecting that conspiracy and the people who believe in it i've been a big supporter of mental health i'd recommend the people who believe it maybe should take advantage while it still exists in the affordable care act it's bizarre totally bizarre and now have you guys found that plain load of people in uniforms and weapons and flying around i mean you know have you found them yet is anybody even from by the way i respect conservative and liberal points of view in the press anybody found that plane what in god's name are we doing look at how it makes us look around the world it's mortifying it's embarrassing and it's dangerous it's dangerous if the president doesn't know better which i he has to know better and my lord we're in much more trouble than i ever thought we were it's bizarre and you know this is the case where you know i i've been surprised pleased but surprised with folks i've had political arguments with like the former governor of michigan coming out and endorsed me all the republicans are endorsing me they're they're rich where i am that this can't go on this cannot go on it's a deconstruction of a democratic system they know it so i just um i'll conclude with what you heard me say many times before the words of a president matter even a lousy president it gives soccer it gives encouragement to people who are spouting irrational views that no one has even close to ever presuming or showing ever existed and it's done for a simple reason from the very beginning he's understood the only way he could win the first time and can win this time is he fundamentally divides the nation puts the nation divides us or in each other's throats that's not who we are that's not who we are thank you thank you mr vice president last night president trump mocked you for wearing a mask and said that this is a sign that you must have some quote big issues he says this even though he knows that according to scientists and public health officials wearing masks saves lives i wonder if you worry that this kind of language that comes from the president of the united states could deter some americans who are tuning in to him to not wear masks well i i worry frieza is a big issue i'm a smart fella i listen to scientists this is not a game life and death life and death reports that we're going to have maybe there's some reports there's another 100 000 dead as many as 100 000 dead more by the end of the year i mean i don't i i don't get it i mean i i just anyway i i it's it's hard to respond to something so idiotic okay um before my second question just quickly have you been tested now for cobin 19 yes i had how many times i've been tested once with the deep test and i'm going to continue to be testing on a regular basis um could i just ask quickly about attorney general william barr saying on cnn this week he said that his assessment right now uh is that china poses the most aggressive threat to u.s elections even more than iran or russia uh do you believe him is that also your understanding based on the intelligence briefings that you have received no it's not consistent with the briefings i've received and uh he's a lousy enough attorney general but he's a really bad intelligence officer it's not consistent because you believe because i believe what i've been told and you all know it i mean look it's uh you even have outfits like facebook taking some hey look it's just there are a lot of countries around the world i think would be happy to see our elections destabilized but the one who's working the hardest most consistently and never has led up is russia and again it's unfair to say to you guys but ask yourself the rhetorical question what is he so afraid of vladimir putin i mean what what's the problem i mean nothing nothing it's almost obsequious i mean anyway i uh i just want to make it clear i believe any country engages in any activity to delegitimize our impact on american elections is a direct violation of our sovereignty and if i impress united states there will be a response thank you sir uh it's been a couple weeks now since you announced senator harris as your running mate and we haven't seen her out very much including yesterday in kenosha why is that and and what role do you see here playing in the in the final she's been on the road she's out herself the role is that just like when barack and i campaigned we tried to cover as much territory as we could and both of us out campaigning she is an incredibly competent candidate she is doing a great job there will be times we're together but there's a lot of territory to cover i talk with her almost every day i speak with her we work together and i have great confidence there's nothing about not campaigning together it's about being able to cover more territory and just as a second question um do you know when you will have another covet test do you have any plan any future testing well what they're doing is they're going to do it on a regular basis because everyone on the on my service detail and people who come into the house with me they're all attested so i'm just doing i just yes sir show up and put my head back you know when they tell me you don't know where it'll be next one pardon me you don't know where the next one will be well i know i imagine it'll be sometime this week i just don't know i but every regular basis thank you thank you sir um he asked you about another thing the president said last night he once again suggested to his supporters that they should consider voting twice if they're in one of those states that can allow you to request an absentee ballot to fill that out and then go try voting again in person state officials have said it's a felony in some cases just curious what you make of it it is it is a felony you're feeling here in the state of delaware look i mean how many times does this president have to suggest things and say things we all don't just write he's a fraud not not being not not an opinion he wanted to maybe we should delay the election maybe we should you know write in ballots are are are fraudulent not a single bit of evidence this i mean it just is and i think it's all designed to create so much chaos that no matter what the outcome of the election is that it's thrown up in the air i mean i think that must be his reason because i mean he says and does things that um no other president said i'm aware of and american history's ever done and we all go well there's another ridiculous illegal inappropriate thing he said but we say so many of them it doesn't matter i mean it is uh it's just it just undermines the legitimacy of our democratic process and it's dangerous you said today is the angriest youth you've been as a presidential candidate um but you said you're trying to restrain yourself is there a lot of people out there who are supporting you or inclined to not vote for the president who would say why isn't joe biden angrier about all of this because presidents united states should be presidential and should lead by example as well as make clear exactly where they stand getting down in the gutter like the president does saying things that i'd be inclined if we were behind a barn somewhere would be a different thing but that's not the job of a president the job of a president sets an example my anger is real because i must tell you i carry and i deliberately didn't bring with me today delaware national guard had a pin made up that's a gold star that was made up for my son beau who didn't die in the field and i always carry it with me and i didn't carry today because i was worried that if i focus too much on it that i would uh engage in some of the kind of language the president has used i mean but i just think it is sick it is deplorable it is so unamerican it is so unpatriotic and then watching him this morning while i was shaving the tv on talking about he never said anything like that he honored john mccain he's the reason why flags were flown at half mask oh wasn't that noble of him he's the same guy that when the ship went into harbor he made sure the uss mccain was covered you couldn't see it he's the same guy that denigrated john he's the same guy who did a similar thing the way he talked about george h.w bush was shot down in the pacific i mean but he just stands there it's almost pathological i've never said anything like that no one's been better than the military i i i just got to focus on what has to be done not what he did what i do from here what gets done from here thank you sir thank you mr vice president if i could follow up on ed's question about voting we know the president has been attacking mail and voting he's even now suggesting his supporters vote twice we also know that russia has been trying to so doubt about this system are you concerned at all that this messaging may be working that your support supporters may give up on voting by mail because they're concerned that it may be raped yes i am that's why i try not to talk about it too much because i'm playing into we're playing the more we talk about there's two things he wants us to talk about is the election legitimate and the whole country's up in flames everything's burning law and order because he doesn't want to talk about anything anything at all about the job he hasn't done and so it is it's a conundrum there's a lot you could talk about in terms of the specifics that russia is doing and not doing but when you do it all it does is undermine what people think may be the legitimate what i don't want to have happen i don't want people reaching the point where you can understand sometimes it's not worth voting you know it seems to me that one of the things that i keep trying to say to people is go to iwillvote.com figure out iwillvote.com and figure out where you can vote how you can vote what's available to you where you can vote early where you can vote in person where it's going to be safe for you etc plan now plan now but the more chaos it is sown here it's going to disincline people to show up and in a sense i every time i speak about i feel like i'm playing at his game i mean is that not to agree with me does that make sense what i'm saying that's what i'm so i think that's all part of the deal thank you mr vice president um going back to the jobless report from this morning you had acknowledged that less than half of the 22 million jobs that were lost this spring because of pandemic have been recovered what do you think the 1.4 million added back in august says about just the general direction of the economy i think any job at it act is positive i think it matters to the people who got that job back you know maybe you all were raising households like i was where a mom or dad was losing a job because of the economy what's going on in your community you could feel the tension on these in the household how it just everything you know worrying about what you can provide for your family and along the way also look at the people who you've got you know a couple million people out there close to who are part-time workers still can't make it but are are listed as employed and a lot of them also are in the process of wondering whether or not i mean there are a lot of people line up in food lines they're the people many of them who have lost their their uh their employ their health care their their health care provided by their employer there are many they're the same people are out there worrying if this president is able to win in court and wipe out the entire affordable care act and all the 100 million people with pre-existing conditions won't be able to get insurance even if they had the money and i mean it's just the anxiety is enormous is enormous and look again i'm not being solicitous among the brightest people i've dealt with my whole career have been the press not a joke you're all extremely well educated you're well read have significant backgrounds and um and the vast majority have tried to report the news not just opinion but i can't believe that you don't feel the same not democrat republican okay you don't feel the same anxiety because you got a brother or sister a mother a father a son or a daughter who's going through what you're not we're not we have jobs well i don't have a job now but we have jobs and so it's it's a real concern and uh i just think that this has moved beyond democrat republican i think has moved to uh um trying to put this country back together again so we can move thank you the president trump has just announced the kosovo and serbia deal and as part president trump has just announced uh an economic normalization deal between serbia and kosovo and part of that deal is kosovo and israel having diplomatic normalization you have stated that you support a two-state solution in the middle east would you support more muslim-majority countries normalizing relations with israel even though it may mean that the palestinians will lose leverage in their fight towards a two-state solution well first of all i'm not i don't know what the deal is you're referring to okay what i have argued relative to serbia and kosovo is that kosovo should be an independent country not a part of serbia i've spent a lot of time there and so i don't know how i assume that would reinforce that independence but i don't know based on what's being said i think normalization of relations among countries is a by and large and almost every instance a good thing to have a muslim majority country normalizing relations with israel in a generic sense seems positive to me but i have to know the detail of what's happening what's going on and i don't know that and it may you may be right that that would cause the palestinians to lose leverage in a decision on a two-state solution more countries recognizing israel oh i do absolutely i do i do and i think that's the thing recognizing israel as an independent jewish state i think that's important and but but also i believe that israel has to be prepared to work toward a genuine two-state solution thank you all very much,b for a chance not a handout just a fair shot at a good job a safe place to live and a well life to pass down to PRON kid this be a special place for the biden family PRON daughter ashley a social worker be a caseworker here help young people who be age out of foster care when PRON son be the attorney general bo come here right here to learn more about job training program for the those work toward a ged or certificate for a good pay job when i be senator and vice president there be plenty of econo economist i have around PRON to talk about every aspect of the economy but i always think about the people who walk through the door here work people white black brown latino what be PRON do be PRON okay i know if PRON be okay as PRON walk through these door the economy be do okay if PRON be not okay PRON be not do well that be what PRON should be think about this late job report but the report reinforce the bad fear and painful truth the economic inequity that begin before the downturn have only worsen under this fail presidency when the crisis start PRON all hope for a few month of a shutdown would be follow by a rapid economic turnaround no one think PRON would lose PRON job for good or see small business shut down on moss that kind of recovery require leadership PRON do not have and still do not have and as a result economist be start to call this recession a k shape recession which be a fancy phrase for what be wrong with everything about trump presidency the k mean those at the top be say thing go up and those in the middle and below be see thing go down and get bad PRON be no surprise because that root of this be the fact that trump have mismanage the covet crisis and that be why PRON be a k shaped pandemic first the president chaotic chaotic mismanagement of the pandemic PRON be still hold PRON back compare to other major industrial country in europe and asia during the pandemic PRON unemployment rate be still more than double while other nation have only go up by half why because the president have botch the covert response botch PRON badly PRON have say from the beginning PRON can not deal with an economic crisis until PRON beat the pandemic PRON can not have an economic comeback when almost a thousand americans die each day from covet when the death toll have reach about two hundred thousand when more than six million americans have be infect when million more worry about get sick and die as school and business try to reopen PRON all know PRON do not have to be this bad PRON do not have to be this bad to begin with if the president just do PRON job if PRON just take the virus seriously early on in january and february as PRON spread around the globe if PRON just take the step PRON need back in march and april to institute widespread testing and trace to control the virus if PRON provide clear national scientific base guidance to state and local authority if PRON just set a good example like social distancing and wear a mask PRON be not too much to ask PRON be almost like PRON do not care PRON do not affect PRON because PRON do not affect PRON or PRON class of friend anyone with a big enough checkbook can get rapid test on demand if PRON do not PRON may have to wait in line for hour and wait for week to get PRON result if PRON can get PRON at all PRON have the kind of job where PRON can work from a laptop at home remotely risk get covet be very small at work this job report show that million people report teleworke in august but if PRON work in an assembly line or checkout counter or a meat packing plant or drive a truck or deliver package PRON be much great risk and the job report show that more than million worker report that PRON could not work or lose hour because PRON employer have to close or lose business due to the pandemic if PRON can hire a private tutor or have a live in child care PRON can balance be a parent and remote schooling if PRON can not PRON have to do PRON job and be a teacher all at once jill and i have hold briefing on reopen school safety two day ago ask the question be PRON hear so many parent call and ask us educator who feel like PRON be in an impossible situation what be PRON suppose to do with PRON child when the president have make PRON so hard for school to reopen safely what be the alternative when PRON be devastating to keep PRON isolate from PRON friend and PRON support system i also say earlier this week to the uh shock of many that PRON lose more cop this year to covet than on patrol this reminder how an already dangerous job law enforcement have get more dangerous because of trump mismanagement what make jeb what may be just as shocking be many other job have also become dangerous due to covet be a health care worker be now more dangerous than ever PRON have lose hundred of PRON this year because PRON be not protect from covent on the job meat packer more dangerous than ever so many have die due to get covert at work work for waitress and waiter and transit worker all become more dangerous with so many die of coven lady and gentleman no matter what PRON say or what PRON claim PRON be not safe in donald trump america PRON be not safe in donald trump america where people be die at a rate last see when americans be fight in world war ii donald trump malpractice during this pandemic have make be a work american a life for death work and while there be a disproportionate impact on black latino and asian americans and native americans work class community white working class community be be hit hard as well opioid death for example be up during the pandemic another crisis that trump continue to all but ignore in the meantime trump and PRON friend have strong view about what the rest of america should do quote cut unemployment benefit to force people to go back to PRON job end of quote to fund social security and eliminate obamacare in the middle of a pandemic and to quote reopen public school without resource or guidance reopen main street business without protection for worker so corporation can continue to soar this be PRON plan second and similarly the economic pain remain unrelenting for million of work people of every race and background be not get relief PRON need meanwhile well if PRON be do just fine some well than ever this diversion of fortune be unique to any recession in recent memory and the painful truth be PRON just have a president who just do not see PRON PRON do not feel PRON PRON do not understand PRON just do not care PRON think if the stock market be up then everything be fine if PRON wealthy friend and donor be do well then everything be do well if corporation see PRON evaluation rise then PRON must be hire but the good economist know what i know PRON have learn grow up in scranton and clemont delaware up the road place where folk be not invest in the market like wealthy americans a measure of PRON economic success be the quality of life of the american people and if PRON stock soar family teeter on the brink of hunger and homelessness and PRON president call that success what do that say about what PRON value when PRON see the world in such a narrow prison PRON be no wonder PRON do not see nearly million americans on unemployment one in six small business be that be close right now PRON do not understand what life be like for people walk by PRON board up shop educator afraid that do PRON job that the job PRON love will bring the virus home to the people PRON love or a parent search for health insurance now that the furlough have turn into a layoff PRON be no wonder PRON do not see the single mom force to wait in a three hour food line so for the first time in PRON life so PRON can feed PRON family because PRON be now part of the one in six household with child that do not have enough to eat PRON want PRON to believe that PRON be do well to keep PRON up and not notice that this remain the bad economic situation since the great depression and PRON country face the historic divergence in PRON way of life which get PRON PRON third and final point and what the american people really need to understand all pain and suffering stem from president trump failure to lead PRON sheer inability and willingness to bring people together PRON like to sign executive order action for photo op but PRON be ill conceive and could do more harm than good PRON say protect renter from eviction that be what PRON be do but PRON be not give PRON any support to pay the rent when PRON come due million of americans all will be leave with the terrible choice between eviction and live in the street or pay back rent PRON simply do not have when there be an answer offer and reject PRON say PRON be continue to provide enhanced employment unemployment insurance payment but PRON cut the amount that everyone on PRON receive leave PRON on the edge when PRON run out in a few week or sooner PRON should be do PRON job of call congressional leader together immediately to get a deal and deliver real result for the american people this be the first president in the middle of a crisis PRON have never see have call congress into the oval office if i be president that be what i do and PRON would get PRON do like previous president president rental food unemployment assistance ten of million struggle americans student loan relief small business support and aid to school and state government that be go bankrupt and as long as this pandemic and the accompanying economic catastrophe persist no one no one should have PRON water or power cut off because PRON can not afford to pay the bill bottom line mr president do PRON job get off PRON golf course and out of the sand bunker call the leader together in the oval office sit with PRON and make a deal make a deal that deliver for work americans and ease PRON anxiety and pain in july i lay out PRON build back well plan for an economy that work for everyone over the next three week PRON will be lay out the sharp contrast PRON plan have with the president non plan PRON will be ask american people three basic question who can handle the pandemic who can keep PRON promise and who care about and will fight for work family like the people here at west end throughout this pandemic PRON find PRON way to keep the center

more by the end of the year i mean i do not i i do not get PRON i mean i i just anyway i i PRON be PRON be hard to respond to something so idiotic okay um before PRON second question just quickly have PRON be test now for cobin yes i have how many time PRON have be test once with the deep test and PRON be go to continue to be test on a regular basis um could i just ask quickly about attorney general william barr say on cnn this week PRON say that PRON assessment right now uh be that china pose the most aggressive threat to u s election even more than iran or russia uh do PRON believe PRON be that also PRON understanding base on the intelligence briefing that PRON have receive no PRON be not consistent with the briefing PRON have receive and uh PRON be a lousy enough attorney general but PRON be a really bad intelligence officer PRON be not consistent because PRON believe because i believe what PRON have be tell and PRON all know PRON i mean look PRON be uh PRON even have outfit like facebook take some hey look PRON be just there be a lot of country around the world i think would be happy to see PRON election destabilize but the one who be work the hardest most consistently and never have lead up be russia and again PRON be unfair to say to PRON guy but ask PRON the rhetorical question what be PRON so afraid of vladimir putin i mean what what be the problem i mean nothing nothing PRON be almost obsequious i mean anyway i uh i just want to make PRON clear i believe any country engage in any activity to delegitimize PRON impact on american election be a direct violation of PRON sovereignty and if i impress united states there will be a response thank PRON sir uh PRON be be a couple week now since PRON announce senator harris as PRON running mate and PRON have not see PRON out very much include yesterday in kenosha why be that and and what role do PRON see here play in the in the final PRON be be on the road PRON be out PRON the role be that just like when barack and i campaign PRON try to cover as much territory as PRON could and both of PRON out campaign PRON be an incredibly competent candidate PRON be do a great job there will be time PRON be together but there be a lot of territory to cover i talk with PRON almost every day i speak with PRON PRON work together and i have great confidence there be nothing about not campaign together PRON be about be able to cover more territory and just as a second question um do PRON know when PRON will have another covet test do PRON have any plan any future testing well what PRON be do be PRON be go to do PRON on a regular basis because everyone on the on PRON service detail and people who come into the house with PRON PRON be all attest so PRON be just do i just yes sir show up and put PRON head back PRON know when PRON tell PRON PRON do not know where PRON will be next one pardon PRON PRON do not know where the next one will be well i know i imagine PRON will be sometime this week i just do not know i but every regular basis thank PRON thank PRON sir um PRON ask PRON about another thing the president say last night PRON once again suggest to PRON supporter that PRON should consider vote twice if PRON be in one of those state that can allow PRON to request an absentee ballot to fill that out and then go try vote again in person state official have say PRON be a felony in some case just curious what PRON make of PRON PRON be PRON be a felony PRON be feel here in the state of delaware look i mean how many time do this president have to suggest thing and say thing PRON all do not just write PRON be a fraud not not be not not an opinion PRON want to maybe PRON should delay the election maybe PRON should PRON know write in ballot be be be fraudulent not a single bit of evidence this i mean PRON just be and i think PRON be all design to create so much chaos that no matter what the outcome of the election be that PRON be throw up in the air i mean i think that must be PRON reason because i mean PRON say and do thing that um no other president say PRON be aware of and american history ever do and PRON all go well there be another ridiculous illegal inappropriate thing PRON say but PRON say so many of PRON PRON do not matter i mean PRON be uh PRON be just PRON just undermine the legitimacy of PRON democratic process and PRON be dangerous PRON say today be the angry youth PRON have be as a presidential candidate um but PRON say PRON be try to restrain PRON be there a lot of people out there who be support PRON or incline to not vote for the president who would say why be not joe biden angrier about all of this because president united states should be presidential and should lead by example as well as make clear exactly where PRON stand get down in the gutter like the president do say thing that PRON would be incline if PRON be behind a barn somewhere would be a different thing but that be not the job of a president the job of a president set an example PRON anger be real because i must tell PRON i carry and i deliberately do not bring with PRON today delaware national guard have a pin make up that be a gold star that be make up for PRON son beau who do not die in the field and i always carry PRON with PRON and i do not carry today because i be worried that if i focus too much on PRON that i would uh engage in some of the kind of language the president have use i mean but i just think PRON be sick PRON be deplorable PRON be so unamerican PRON be so unpatriotic and then watch PRON this morning while i be shave the tv on talk about PRON never say anything like that PRON honor john mccain PRON be the reason why flag be fly at half mask oh be not that noble of PRON PRON be the same guy that when the ship go into harbor PRON make sure the uss mccain be cover PRON could not see PRON PRON be the same guy that denigrate john PRON be the same guy who do a similar thing the way PRON talk about george h w bush be shoot down in the pacific i mean but PRON just stand there PRON be almost pathological PRON have never say anything like that no one be be well than the military i i i just get to focus on what have to be do not what PRON do what i do from here what get do from here thank PRON sir thank PRON mr vice president if i could follow up on ed question about vote PRON know the president have be attack mail and voting PRON be even now suggest PRON supporter vote twice PRON also know that russia have be try to so doubt about this system be PRON concerned at all that this messaging may be work that PRON support supporter may give up on voting by mail because PRON be concerned that PRON may be rape yes i be that be why i try not to talk about PRON too much because PRON be play into PRON be play the more PRON talk about there be two thing PRON want PRON to talk about be the election legitimate and the whole country up in flame everything burn law and order because PRON do not want to talk about anything anything at all about the job PRON have not do and so PRON be PRON be a conundrum there be a lot PRON could talk about in term of the specific that russia be do and not do but when PRON do PRON all PRON do be undermine what people think may be the legitimate what i do not want to have happen i do not want people reach the point where PRON can understand sometimes PRON be not worth voting PRON know PRON seem to PRON that one of the thing that i keep try to say to people be go to iwillvote com figure out iwillvote com and figure out where PRON can vote how PRON can vote what be available to PRON where PRON can vote early where PRON can vote in person where PRON be go to be safe for PRON etc plan now plan now but the more chaos PRON be sow here PRON be go to disincline people to show up and in a sense i every time i speak about i feel like PRON be play at PRON game i mean be that not to agree with PRON do that make sense what PRON be say that be what PRON be so i think that be all part of the deal thank PRON mr vice president um go back to the jobless report from this morning PRON have acknowledge that less than half of the million job that be lose this spring because of pandemic have be recover what do PRON think the million add back in august say about just the general direction of the economy i think any job at PRON act be positive i think PRON matter to the people who get that job back PRON know maybe PRON all be raise household like i be where a mom or dad be lose a job because of the economy what be go on in PRON community PRON could feel the tension on these in the household how PRON just everything PRON know worry about what PRON can provide for PRON family and along the way also look at the people who PRON have get PRON know a couple million people out there close to who be part time worker still can not make PRON but be be list as employ and a lot of PRON also be in the process of wonder whether or not i mean there be a lot of people line up in food line PRON be the people many of PRON who have lose PRON PRON uh PRON employ PRON health care PRON PRON health care provide by PRON employer there be many PRON be the same people be out there worry if this president be able to win in court and wipe out the entire affordable care act and all the million people with pre existing condition will not be able to get insurance even if PRON have the money and i mean PRON be just the anxiety be enormous be enormous and look again PRON be not be solicitous among the bright people PRON have deal with PRON whole career have be the press not a joke PRON be all extremely well educate PRON be well read have significant background and um and the vast majority have try to report the news not just opinion but i can not believe that PRON do not feel the same not democrat republican okay PRON do not feel the same anxiety because PRON get a brother or sister a mother a father a son or a daughter who be go through what PRON be not PRON be not PRON have job well i do not have a job now but PRON have job and so PRON be PRON be a real concern and uh i just think that this have move beyond democrat republican i think have move to uh um try to put this country back together again so PRON can move thank PRON the president trump have just announce the kosovo and serbia deal and as part president trump have just announce uh an economic normalization deal between serbia and kosovo and part of that deal be kosovo and israel have diplomatic normalization PRON have state that PRON support a two state solution in the middle east would PRON support more muslim majority country normalize relation with israel even though PRON may mean that the palestinians will lose leverage in PRON fight towards a two state solution well first of all PRON be not i do not know what the deal be PRON be refer to okay what i have argue relative to serbia and kosovo be that kosovo should be an independent country not a part of serbia PRON have spend a lot of time there and so i do not know how i assume that would reinforce that independence but i do not know base on what be be say i think normalization of relation among country be a by and large and almost every instance a good thing to have a muslim majority country normalize relation with israel in a generic sense seem positive to PRON but i have to know the detail of what be happen what be go on and i do not know that and PRON may PRON may be right that that would cause the palestinians to lose leverage in a decision on a two state solution more country recognize israel oh i do absolutely i do i do and i think that be the thing recognize israel as an independent jewish state i think that be important and but but also i believe that israel have to be prepare to work toward a genuine two state solution thank PRON all very much
85,idOtq9GvNmw,biden,2020-09-09T18:43:56Z,"Joe Biden on taxes, Woodward book revelations in Michigan",speech,[Music] since i'm socially distant i'm allowed to take my mask off and tell me while i speak but i promise i'll put it back on go okay ladies and gentlemen good afternoon and uh you know secretary and mr president i like the sound of that where is my president there you are thank you pal thanks for the welcome it's great to be here in michigan and uh and with the united auto workers you know uh i uh as they say in parts of my state i got brought up on general motors um my father uh was a random general motors agency he didn't uh he didn't own him but he ran it and i uh you know like cars and cars and cars by the way i still have my 67 corvette uh that's new that was new i just didn't keep that but i got to tell you i'm waiting for that electric one you just got made it goes 210 miles an hour but that's the difference look earlier this week uh the reason we're a little bit late here uh we found out in getting off the plane the press asked me a legitimate question that i did not have the background because it occurred on the plane earlier this week we celebrated labor day and here in the heart of the american automobile industry we'd never forget everything that we over the unions and unions as you've heard me say many times built this country you built the economy the economic engine has driven american manufacturing dynamism and literally literally in the case of the other workers the ones that didn't i want to thank you again for hosting me today and it's great to see senator stabbing up and her friend debbie stamina got a chance to spend the time with the governor but senator stamina and i worked together a lot of matters over the years in the united states she was a great partner to me when i was vice president and worked in lockstep to get the people of michigan back on their feet we joined uh we're joined by one of the best and brightest and hardest working governors around my friend gretchen whitmer and if you're wondering what responsible strong executive leadership looks like in covenant 19 just look at this executive right here governor you've done an incredible job of scaring the people of michigan through a determining time much of it is brought on by donald trump's lack of leadership you've been rock solid governor you've listened to the experts and you've led the science and you put the needs of the people who are hurting first helping them get through this crisis meanwhile on the day that we hit thousand dead in the united states because of coca-19 we just learned from the washington post columnist bob woodward that the president of the united states is admitted on tape in february he knew about coma 19 that he passed through the air he knew how deadly it was it was much more deadly than the flu he knew and purposely played it down worse he lied to the american people he knowingly and willingly lied about the threat imposed in the country for months he had the information he knew how dangerous he was how all this deadly disease flipped through our nation he failed to do his job on purpose there's a life and death betrayal of the american people experts say that if he had acted just just one week sooner 36 000 people would have been saved if he acted two weeks sooner back in march 54 000 lives would have been spared in march and april alone you know his failures not only cost lives the center of economy and entails spending cost millions more in american livelihoods this is a recession created by donald trump's negligence and he is unfit for this job as a consequence how many schools aren't open right now how many kids are starting a new school year the same way they end the last one at home how many parents feel abandoned and overwhelmed how many front-line workers are exhausted and pushed to their limits and how many families are missing loved ones at their dinner table tonight because of his failures it's beyond despicable it's a dereliction it's disgrace we're gonna hear a lot more about this sure not just for me but from the news media and a lot of others but i want to ask you one simple question what's the value of a promise what's it worth what's the worth of a woman or man's word of a president's word it was not matched with action in 2016 then candidate trump came here to warn just a few days before the election here's what he said he said if i'm elected you won't lose one plan you have plans coming into this country you're going to have jobs again you won't lose one plant i promise you i promise you that's what he said donald trump makes a lot of promises he promised that he alone could stop the offshoring jobs he promised he'd bring back jobs stop companies from leaving he could do what quote nobody else could do it but him but she promised that his administration would enforce every last buying american provision on behalf of the american people that makes his wild claims and hopes he now hopes we don't notice what he said i won't remember and when he does follow through what does it do and follow through the exact opposite he's hoping we just have poor members it doesn't give us much credit the american people are smart honest decent they're hard-working we expect our president to be straight with us to do what he or she says they're going to do so let's look at the reality of donald trump's economy and what exactly his promise the american people and workers are worth he's on track to be the first president since herbert hoover and the great depression to see the number of jobs in our economy go down not up while being president our economy's down 4.7 million jobs since he took office 4.7 even before president trump's failed response to covert 19 crashed our economy his reckless and chaotic trade policy had thrown american manufacturing into recession it was already contracting in 2019 even when covert 19 hit trump would before it hit trump was creating an average of 500 000 jobs fewer per year than the last three years when president obama and i were in office when the gm transmission plan here in warren closed last year i bet the workers around weren't all that comforted by trump's empty promises under donald trump michigan lost all their jobs even before kobe did what about offshoring has trump delivered on stopping companies from shipping jobs overseas american jobs we already know the answer of course not the rate of offshoring by federal contractors there are people that get federal dollars from the federal government to do things the offshoring big companies being paid by u.s taxpayers has doubled doubled under trump those contracts federal contracts your tax dollars they double the number that have been offshored he invited companies to the white house to make what he called a pledge to american workers he couldn't even keep those funds from us many were given lucrative federal contracts but then some of them turned around and shipped 7 000 jobs overseas under president trump's u.s trade deficit has grown it's hit an all-time high let me say that again u.s trade difference deficit is an all-time high under trump the last three years president trump's answer to all this is the same exactly everything corporate tax giveaways actually ward off short you heard me right giveaways that reward offshoring if you're offshore you get more tax breaks this 2017 tax bill slashed taxes on companies that send production and jobs overseas those corporations then make huge profits by shipping these foreign main products back to the united states to sell the american consumers and no industry has taken a greater advantage of trump's offshoring tax loopholes and the pharmaceutical news pharma lobbied trump for a handout that's exactly what they got from me farmers building u.s farm this building factors overseas instead of the united states skipping out and having to pay u.s taxes and then sending those same foreign-made drugs back to american consumers all who are raising their prices on prescription jobs that union families and working people have to be lying and the process by the way is trying to do away with all health care in america during the pandemic we're seeing not only the inequity of this policy but the enormous vulnerability that this creates for our own health security and our security requires us to have supply chains of the necessary drugs based here not overseas not overseas in times of crisis what about trump's commitment to buy america like like the rest of president trump's promise it has nothing to do with reality it's all a bunch of hot air in fact contracts awarded by u.s governments to foreign companies using american tax dollars went up 30 since he's been pressured so to recap one trump hasn't stopped companies from closing plans and sending jobs overseas two they supported companies that have cut jobs and failed to invest here at home with billions of dollars in tax breaks and three is awarding more and more federal contracts to foreign companies president trump has broken just about every promise he's ever made to the american worker and he's failed he's failed our economy and our country but look to really expect anything different from this guy from someone who called those of you and those who are serving in uniform who have given their lives country losers and suckers let me tell you something my son beau was an assistant u.s attorney volunteered to go to kosovo it's helped him set up a government in the middle of the war i know as i'm being proud here but he's one of the only foreigner has a monument that they raised and built in service to him thanking him for what he did my son also then his attorney general volunteered to go to iraq for one year he wasn't a loser or a sucker no one who served this nation has been a loser or sucker they're all heroes would you expect anything different from someone who could stand next to a father of a fallen soldier and say at a cemetery and say i don't get it what was in it for them what was in it for them donald trump doesn't understand what it means to serve something bigger than yourself he doesn't understand duty honor country listening by different code wise selfishness greed yes donald trump and i have a pretty different philosophy come forgiving our word mind means something when i tell the american people i'm going to do something i follow through here in michigan you know that's true barack and i took office back in 2009 the economy was crashing the inherited economy in free fall and millions of americans include so many including somebody right here in michigan lost their jobs their homes and mercedes with helping debbie regular neck here president obama and i worked hard put me in charge of the recovery act i spent a lot of time here in michigan and detroit working with you and says understaffed allen thinking every single day about the folks on the factory line busting their backs just trying to put food a lot of folks were all ready to count detroit out as well as the auto americanism and count it out well i knew what debbie knew i've known always it's never a good bet to bet against the american worker so we promised to stand in the american auto ministry we delivered we didn't do it to help wealthy investors or pad bonus checks from ceos we did it to save an iconic american industry a testament to the skills and ingenuity of american manufacturing the jobs of hundreds of thousands of american workers the lifeblood of communities all across the midwest and used to be in my state of delaware as well when detroit declared bankruptcy i was right here working alongside the city leaders to get the lights turned back on to revitalize the future of detroit now while nearly 20 000 auto manufacturing jobs have been lost in michigan under trump nearly 80 000 were created during the obama bike administration i've got a long history of not just talking about what i'm going to do but delivering results from michiganders and now we need to do it again we need to do the hard work not only to recover but to build the economy back for the future once more that's why i might build back better agenda that's what it's all about and it starts right here with you in the union halls all across america back in july i made the first plank of my agenda plan to modernize american manufacturing technology to ensure that the future is made in america well if you today we're going to be announcing some additional steps to make this plank even stronger first we're going to impose a tax penalty on companies that avoid paying u.s u.s taxes by offshoring jobs and manufacturing only to sell those goods back to the americans [Applause] if you're a big your big corporate strategy is to boost your shareholders profits your see ceo's bonuses by moving jobs out well we're gonna make sure not only pay full u.s taxes on those profits but we're gonna guarantee we're gonna add 10 offshoring penalty surtax to your bill no more deductions for writing off expenses for the cost of sending jobs overseas which is a big deal that could be done here at home by qualified american workers i'm not looking to punish american business but there's a better way make it in michigan make it in america invest in our communities and the workers in places like warren that's what this is about uaw workers steel workers ibmw workers you're the best craftsman and women in the world and you're right here if you're ready to make it in america and just like there are consequences for offshoring the rewards and incentives for creating good paying jobs here at home today i'm announcing my new american made in america tax credit a 10 advanceable tax credit for companies that invest in the united states and american workers to help accelerate the recovery under our fill back better agenda severe company revitalizes a closed closing facility here in the united states like the transmission plan that got closed last year we'll take care of 10 percent of the investment that company makes to reopen it if you retool a manufacturing facility to make it more competitive for example by shifting to help build a new fleet of clean american vehicles made by uaw members we'll make sure that's more than affordable for you we're going to make sure we get attacked there to reassure jobs that have presently been previously been sent overseas expand your operations united states or increase wages for manufacturing jobs will make an even smarter strategic decision for your company because we will make sure you get a tax credit you know these two steps are on top of my plans to close each and every one of the top trump loopholes that have created and created in 2017 with this tax cut to reward companies with big tax breaks for offshoring that's going to end and you're going to want to build things here in the united states because under our administration the white house administration is going to deliver on the promise to buy america it's been the law for almost a century but we've never lived up to it the idea is simple today the u.s government spends about 600 billion dollars of taxpayers money on federal contracts annually and that money should go to support american jobs and american businesses but president trump has only ever treated it like it was a weak suggestion agencies the federal government can require can waive the requirement while the explanations that trump doesn't bother you to kick back on we're going to change that in my first week i'll sign a series of executive actions to make sure to be enforced by america and direct the full purchasing power of the federal government to fulfill its promise starting by closing those waiver loopholes immediately i promise you i'll use the full power of the defense production act to enforce buy american and tighten the rules for public infrastructure projects i'm going to crack down on companies that label products as made in america even if they're coming from china or elsewhere you know we found out that on trump's watch a company selling deployment bags to active duty troops being deployed falsely claimed his product was made in america when in fact it was really made mostly in china trump didn't do anything to respond i'm not going to happen to my watch we're going to have an office at the white house dedicated to making sure everyone is playing by the same made in america rules and one more thing when i say we're going to use the purchasing power of the federal government to reinvigorate domestic manufacturing i mean we're going to do that with the american automobile industry as well the united states government owns and maintains an enormous fleet of vehicles we're going to convert those governed vehicles into electric vehicles made in america sourced right here in the united states of america with the government providing the demand and support to retool factories that are suggesting they're struggling to compete the united states honorable automobile industry will set up expanding the capacity in the united states not china to lead the world with clean energy vehicles i can't wait to get a set behind that all electric cordless that goes 210 miles an hour you all think i'm kidding i'm eating last year that converted corvette set a speed record 210.2 miles per hour electric vehicle so don't tell me you don't still make the best cars right here in the united states of america and trucks we're going to make it easy for american consumers to switch selected vehicles we're going to build on all the new infrastructure we're going to build the highways we're going to build a network of 500 000 charging stations across america providing prevailing wage jobs for the ipw and other crafts all across the country and by offering rebates incentives to swap older fuel-efficient vehicles for new clean american-made models saving hundreds of millions of barrels of oil together this will mean listen to me now one million new jobs in the american automobile industry one million the supply chain as well as associated we can do this we can do this we can revitalize our industrial base as the heart of the american middle class think about the worker and warren who when the transmission plaque closed he told the reporter not quoting it getting a good gm job 23 years ago for me was like winning the lobby i was trying to start a family i was able to buy a house i went to disney world all that think about it a job that felt like winning a lottery because it opened the door to a life that you wanted for yourself because it gave you dignity a lot to provide for your family getting a good job in 2020 right here in america shouldn't be a lottery it should be an absolute expectation i don't accept the defeat is here but the forces of automation and globalization people can't keep good pay and human jobs and create work i don't buy for one second the vitality of american manufacturing is a thing in the past we have the most qualified workers in the world american manufacturing [Applause] it's the old expression you heard your grandpa saying grandmother was the arsenal democracy in world war ii guess what it's going to be part of the engine of american prosperity now in 2021. we're going to make it happen with american grit american determination and american union workers look folks [Applause] that's my promise keep in mind you know when back in the 30s they set up a law relating to humans and said that i could have you and said the government should encourage unions to increase publicly you're going to have the best most friendly union president in history united states of america when i'm on my way [Applause] don't give up hope don't give up hope you can come back and come back stronger than we were before thank you all i carry with me i don't have a gate give it to my staff i carry with me in my pocket hey do i have that around anyone i can't go anywhere i carry a schedule in my mind but list every single day the number of troops lost in afghanistan this must-have the back of the schedule is always a black box i can't even see it it says daily usf troops died in iraq and afghanistan six thousand nine hundred and twenty-two not over six thousand six thousand nine hundred twenty-two because every one of those women left behind not over 42 000. u.s covet infected military all right excuse me us coven infected in america six thousand three hundred forty four thousand seven hundred u.s proven deaths 1189 506 military coven infected 118 984 military covenant deaths 6 1114 folks every one of these lives matter every one of these lives left somebody behind you can't ever forget ever thank you all god bless you and god protect our troops thank you you,b music since PRON be

with action in then candidate trump come here to warn just a few day before the election here be what PRON say PRON say if PRON be elect PRON will not lose one plan PRON have plan come into this country PRON be go to have job again PRON will not lose one plant i promise PRON i promise PRON that be what PRON say donald trump make a lot of promise PRON promise that PRON alone could stop the offshore job PRON promise PRON would bring back job stop company from leave PRON could do what quote nobody else could do PRON but PRON but PRON promise that PRON administration would enforce every last buy american provision on behalf of the american people that make PRON wild claim and hope PRON now hope PRON do not notice what PRON say i will not remember and when PRON do follow through what do PRON do and follow through the exact opposite PRON be hope PRON just have poor member PRON do not give PRON much credit the american people be smart honest decent PRON be hard work PRON expect PRON president to be straight with PRON to do what PRON or PRON say PRON be go to do so let PRON look at the reality of donald trump economy and what exactly PRON promise the american people and worker be worth PRON be on track to be the first president since herbert hoover and the great depression to see the number of job in PRON economy go down not up while be president PRON economy down million job since PRON take office even before president trump failed response to covert crash PRON economy PRON reckless and chaotic trade policy have throw american manufacturing into recession PRON be already contract in even when covert hit trump would before PRON hit trump be create an average of job few per year than the last three year when president obama and i be in office when the gm transmission plan here in warren close last year i bet the worker around be not all that comfort by trump empty promise under donald trump michigan lose all PRON job even before kobe do what about offshoring have trump deliver on stop company from ship job overseas american job PRON already know the answer of course not the rate of offshoring by federal contractor there be people that get federal dollar from the federal government to do thing the offshoring big company be pay by u s taxpayer have double double under trump those contract federal contract PRON tax dollar PRON double the number that have be offshore PRON invite company to the white house to make what PRON call a pledge to american worker PRON could not even keep those fund from PRON many be give lucrative federal contract but then some of PRON turn around and ship job overseas under president trump u s trade deficit have grow PRON be hit an all time high let PRON say that again u s trade difference deficit be an all time high under

PRON get from PRON farmer build u s farm this building factor overseas instead of the united states skip out and have to pay u s taxis and then send those same foreign make drug back to american consumer all who be raise PRON price on prescription job that union family and work people have to be lie and the process by the way be try to do away with all health care in america during the pandemic PRON be see not only the inequity of this policy but the enormous vulnerability that this create for PRON own health security and PRON security require PRON to have supply chain of the necessary drug base here not overseas not overseas in time of crisis what about trump commitment to buy america like like the rest of president trump promise PRON have nothing to do with reality PRON be all a bunch of hot air in fact contract award by u s government to foreign company use american tax dollar go up since PRON be be pressure so to recap one trump have not stop company from closing plan and send job overseas two PRON support company that have cut job and fail to invest here at home with billion of dollar in tax break and three be award more and more federal contract to foreign company president trump have break just about every promise PRON be ever make to the american worker and PRON be fail PRON be fail PRON economy and PRON country but look to really expect anything different from this guy from someone who call those of PRON and those who be serve in uniform who have give PRON life country loser and sucker let PRON tell PRON something PRON son beau be an assistant u s attorney volunteer to go to kosovo PRON be help PRON set up a government in the middle of the war i know as PRON be be proud here but PRON be one of the only foreigner have a monument that PRON raise and build in service to PRON thank PRON for what PRON do PRON son also then PRON attorney general volunteer to go to iraq for one year PRON be not a loser or a sucker no one who serve this nation have be a loser or sucker PRON be all hero would PRON expect anything different from someone who could stand next to a father of a fall soldier and say at a cemetery and say i do not get PRON what be in PRON for PRON what be in PRON for PRON donald trump do not understand what PRON mean to serve something big than PRON PRON do not understand duty honor country listen by different code

michigan lose PRON job PRON home and mercede with help debbie regular neck here president obama and i work hard put PRON in charge of the recovery act i spend a lot of time here in michigan and detroit work with PRON and say understaffed allen think every single day about the folk on the factory line bust PRON back just try to put food a lot of folk be all ready to count detroit out as well as the auto americanism and count PRON out well i know what debbie know PRON have know always PRON be never a good bet to bet against the american worker so PRON promise to stand in the american auto ministry PRON deliver PRON do not do PRON to help wealthy investor or pad bonus check from ceo PRON do PRON to save an iconic american industry a testament to the skill and ingenuity of american manufacture the job of hundred of thousand of american worker the lifeblood of community all across the midwest and use to be in PRON state of delaware as well when detroit declare bankruptcy i be right here work alongside the city leader to get the light turn back on to revitalize the future of detroit now while nearly auto manufacturing job have be lose in michigan under trump nearly be create during the obama bike administration PRON have get a long history of not just talk about what PRON be go to do but deliver result from michigander and now PRON need to do PRON again PRON need to do the hard work not only to recover but to build the economy back for the future once more that be why i may build back well agenda that be what PRON be all about and PRON start right here with PRON in the union hall all across america back in july i make the first plank of PRON agenda plan to modernize american manufacture technology to ensure that the future be make in america well if PRON today PRON be go to be announce some additional step to make this plank even strong first PRON be go to impose a tax penalty on company that avoid pay u s u s taxis by offshore job and manufacture only to sell those good back to the americans applause if PRON be a big PRON big corporate strategy be to boost PRON shareholder profit PRON see ceo bonus by move job out well PRON be go to make sure not only pay full u s taxis on those profit but PRON be go to guarantee PRON be go to add offshoring penalty surtax to PRON bill no more deduction for write off expense for the cost of send job overseas which be a big deal that could be do here at home by qualified american worker PRON be not look to punish american business but there be a well way make PRON in michigan make PRON in america invest in PRON community and the worker in place like warren that be what this be about uaw worker steel worker ibmw worker PRON be the good craftsman and woman in the world and PRON be right here if PRON be ready to make PRON in america and just like there be consequence for offshore the reward and incentive for create good pay job here at home today PRON be announce PRON new american make in america tax credit a advanceable tax credit for company that invest in the united states and american worker to help accelerate the recovery under PRON fill back well agenda severe company revitalize a closed closing facility here in the united states like the transmission plan that get close last year PRON will take care of percent of the investment that company make to reopen PRON if PRON retool a manufacturing facility to make PRON more competitive for example by shift to help build a new fleet of clean american vehicle make by uaw member PRON will make sure that be more than affordable for PRON PRON be go to make sure PRON get attack there to reassure job that have presently be previously be send overseas expand PRON operation united states or increase wage for manufacture job will make an even smart strategic decision for PRON company because PRON will make sure PRON get a tax credit PRON know these two step be on top of PRON plan to close each and every one of the top trump loophole that have create and create in with this tax cut to reward company with big tax break for offshoring that be go to end and PRON be go to want to build thing here in the united states because under PRON administration the white house administration be go to deliver on the promise to buy america PRON be be the law for almost a century but PRON have never live up to PRON the idea be simple today the u s government spend about billion dollar of taxpayer money on federal contract annually and that money should go to support american job and american business but president trump have only ever treat PRON like PRON be a weak suggestion agencie the federal government can require can waive the requirement while the explanation that trump do not bother PRON to kick back on PRON be go to change that in PRON first week PRON will sign a series of executive action to make sure to be enforce by america and direct the full purchasing power of the federal government to fulfill PRON promise start by close those waiver loophole immediately i promise PRON PRON will use the full power of the defense production act to enforce buy american and tighten the rule for public infrastructure project PRON be go to crack down on company that label product as make in america even if PRON be come from china or elsewhere PRON know PRON find out that on trump watch a company sell deployment bag to active duty troop be deploy falsely claim PRON product be make in america when in fact PRON be really make mostly in china trump do not do anything to respond PRON be not go to happen to PRON watch PRON be go to have an office at the white house dedicate to make sure everyone be play by the same make in america rules and one more thing when i say PRON be go to use the purchase power of the federal government to reinvigorate domestic manufacturing i mean PRON be go to do that with the american automobile industry as well the united states government own and maintain an enormous fleet of vehicle PRON be go to convert those govern vehicle into electric vehicle make in america source right here in the united states of america with the government provide the demand and support to retool factory that be suggest PRON be struggle to compete the united states honorable automobile industry will set up expand the capacity in the united states not china to lead the world with clean energy vehicle i can not wait to get a set behind that all electric cordless that go mile an hour PRON all think PRON be kid PRON be eat last year that convert corvette set a speed record mile per hour electric vehicle so do not tell PRON PRON do not still make the good car right here in the united states of america and truck PRON be go to make PRON easy for american consumer to switch select vehicle PRON be go to build on all the new infrastructure PRON be go to build the highway PRON be go to build a network of charge station across america provide prevail wage job for the ipw and other craft all across the country and by offer rebate incentive to swap old fuel efficient vehicle for new clean american make model save hundred of million of barrel of oil together this will mean listen to PRON now one million new job in the american automobile industry one million the supply chain as well as associate PRON can do this PRON can do this PRON can revitalize PRON industrial base as the heart of the american middle class think about the worker and warren who when the transmission plaque close PRON tell the reporter not quote PRON get a good gm job year ago for PRON be like win the lobby i be try to start a family i be able to buy a house i go to disney world all that think about PRON a job that feel like win a lottery because PRON open the door to a life that PRON want for PRON because PRON give PRON dignity a lot to provide for PRON family get a good job in right here in america should not be a lottery PRON should be an absolute expectation i do not accept the defeat be here but the force of automation and globalization people can not keep good pay and human job and create work i do not buy for one second the vitality of american manufacturing be a thing in the past PRON have the most qualified worker in the world american manufacturing applause PRON be the old expression PRON hear PRON grandpa say grandmother be the arsenal democracy in world war ii guess what PRON be go to be part of the engine of american prosperity now in PRON be go to make PRON happen with american grit american determination and american union worker look folk applause that be PRON promise keep in mind PRON know when back in the PRON set up a law relate to human and say that i could have PRON and say the government should encourage union to increase publicly PRON be go to have the best most friendly union president in history united states of america when PRON be on PRON way applause do not give up hope do not give up hope PRON can come back and come back strong than PRON be before thank PRON all i carry with PRON i do not have a gate give PRON to PRON staff i carry with PRON in PRON pocket hey do i have that around anyone i can not go anywhere i carry a schedule in

90,Qw1DKZjKIjs,biden,2020-09-14T17:57:38Z,Joe Biden Delivers Remarks on West Coast Wildfires in Delaware,speech,check check check one two one two three four check check check one two one two three four one two test test test one so so [Music] so [Music] [Applause] you you good afternoon welcome to the natural history museum you know as a nation we face one of the most difficult moments in our history in my view four historic crises all at the same time the worst pandemic in a hundred years that's already killed nearly two hundred thousand people in county the worst economic crisis since the great depression has cost tens of millions of american jobs and counting emboldened white supremacy unseen since the 60s and a reckoning on race that's long overdue and undeniable acceleration of the punishing reality of climate change on our planet and our people on the lives and livelihoods which i'd like to talk about now jill and i continued as i suspect all of you do is pray for everyone in california oregon and washington and across the west as these devastating wildfires rage on just as we hold them in our hearts those who have faced the hurricanes tropical storms off our coast of florida north carolina or like parts of new orleans that in fact have just been issued an emergency evacuation order for hurricane sally floods and droughts across the midwest the fury of climate change everywhere all this year and right now we stand with our families who have lost everything the firefighters the first responders risking everything to save others and the millions of americans caught between relocating during a pandemic or staying put as ashes in smoke pollute the air they breathe let's think about that people aren't just worried about raging fires they're worried about the air they breathe about the damage to their lungs parents already worried about covet 19 for their children when they're indoors and now they're worried about asthma attacks if their kids are outside over the past two years the total damage from wildfires has reached nearly 50 billion dollars in california alone 50 billion this year alone nearly 5 million acres have burned across 10 states more acreage than the entire state of connecticut and it's only september california's wildfire season typically runs through october fires are blazing so brightly smoke reaching so far nasa satellites can see them one million miles away in space the cost of this year's damage will again be astronomically high but think of it from the view on the ground in the smouldering ashes loved ones lost along with the photos the keepsakes all the memories spouses and kids praying each night for their firefighter husband father wife and mother will they come home entire community is destroyed we have to act as a nation it shouldn't be so bad that millions of americans live in the shadow of an orange sky they're left asking is doomsday here and i know i know this feeling of dread and anxiety extends well beyond the fires we've seen record hurricane season costing billions of dollars as well last month hurricane laura intensified at a near record rate just before its landfall along with louisiana and gulf coast it's a troubling marker not for just the increased frequency of the hurricanes but more powerful and destructive storms they're causing record damage after record damage to people's homes lives and livelihoods and before it intensified and hit the gulf coast lara ravaged puerto rico where three years ago hurricane maria our fellow americans they are still recovering from its damage and devastation think about that reality our fellow americans are still putting things back together from the last big storm as they face the next one we've also seen historic flooding in the midwest often compounding the damage delivered by last year's floods that cost billions of dollars in damage many of you traveled through the midwest beyond that bus tour and you saw it this past spring in midland michigan experienced the flood so devastating with deadly flash flooding over running dams and roadways that have displaced 10 000 residents it was considered once in a 500 year weather event but those once in many generation events they're now happening every year the past 10 years were the hottest decade ever recorded the arctic is literally melting parts are actually on fire what we're seeing in america in our communities is connected to all of this with every bout with nature's fury caused by our own inaction on climate change more can more americans see and feel the devastation whether in a big city small towns on coastlines or in farmlands it's happening everywhere and it's happening now and it affects us all nearly 200 cities not republican or democratic cities 200 cities are experienced the longest stretches of deadly heat waves in 50 years requires them to help their poor and elderly residents adapt to the extreme heat to simply stay alive especially in the homes without air conditioning which many don't have our family farmers in the midwest are facing historic drought those follow records floods and hurricanes sped by wind storms all this year the speed of those wind storms has been incredible when you saw it on television or saw it in person it's ravaged millions of acres of corn soybeans and other crops their very livelihoods which sustain their families and our economy for generation is now in jeopardy how they pay their bills this year will be left to pass on to their kids and none of this is happening in a vacuum recent study showed air pollution is linked with increased risk of death from cover 19. our economy can't recover if it can't build back with more resiliency more ability to withstand extreme weather extreme weather that will only come with greater frequency and intensity the unrelenting impact of climate change affects every single solitary one of us but too often the brunt falls disproportionately on communities of color exacerbating the need for example for environmental justice sorry as a bug speaking of the environment these are interlocking crises of our time requires action not denial requires leadership not scapegoating it requires the president to meet the threshold duty of the office to care to care for everyone to defend us from every attack seen in unseen always and without exception because here's the deal hurricanes don't swerve to avoid red states or blue states wildfires don't skip towns that voted a certain way the impacts of climate change don't pick and choose that's because it's not a partisan phenomenon it's science and our response should be the same grounded in science acting together all of us but like with our federal response to kova 19 the lack of a national strategy on climate on climate change overall leaves us with a patchwork of solutions as a matter of fact it's been made worse by the changes this administration has made i'm speaking from delaware we're the lowest lying state in the nation relative to sea level where just last week delaware state attorney general sued 31 31 big fossil fuel companies alleging that they knowingly wreaked havoc and damage on climate our climate damage that is plain for everyone to see but the president as he flies to california today we know he has no interest in meeting this moment we know he won't listen to the experts or treat this disaster with the urgency it demands as any president should do during the national emergency he's already said he wanted to withhold aid to california to punish the people of california because they didn't vote for him this is another crisis another crisis he won't take responsibility for the west is literally on fire and he blames the people whose homes and communities are burning he says quote you gotta clean your floors you gotta clean your forest this is the same president who threw paper towels on the people of puerto rico instead of truly helping them recover and rebuild we know as disdain for our own military leaders and our veterans just last year the defense department reported that climate change is a direct threat to more than two two-thirds of the military's operationally critical installations that's what the military warned you and this could well be this could be a conservative estimate donald trump climate denial may not have caused these fires and record floods and record hurricanes but if he gets a second term these hellish events will continue to become more common more devastating and more deadly and meanwhile donald trump warns that integration is threatening our suburbs it's ridiculous but you know what is actually threatening our suburbs wildfires are burning the suburbs in the west floods are wiping out suburban neighborhoods in the midwest hurricanes are imperiling suburban life along our coast if we have four more years of trump's climate denial how many suburbs will be burned in wildfires how many suburban neighborhoods will have been flooded out how many suburbs will have been blown away in super storms if you give a climate arsonist four more years in the white house why would anyone be surprised if we have more america blaze if you give a climate denier four more years in the white house why would anyone be surprised when more of america is under water we need a president to respect science who understands that the damage from climate change is already here unless we take urgent action we'll soon be more catastrophic a president who recognizes understands and cares that americans are dying which makes president trump's climate denialism his disdain for science and facts all the more unconscionable once again he fails the most basic duty to a nation he fails to protect us from the pandemic from an economic free fall from racial unrest from the ravages of climate change it's clear that we're not safe in donald trump's america this is donald trump's america he's in charge what he doesn't get is that even in a crisis there's nothing beyond the capacity of the american people when we stand up and act together and while so many of you are hurting right now i want you to know that if you give me the honor of serving as your president we can and we will meet this moment with urgency and purpose we can and we will solve the crime of the climate crisis and we'll build back better than we were before you know when donald trump thinks about climate change he thinks hoax when i think about i think jobs good paying union jobs to put americans to work building a stronger more climate resilient nation a nation modernized we have modernized water and transportation systems an energy infrastructure to withstand the impacts of extreme weather and changing climate when donald trump thinks about renewable energy he sees windmills somehow is causing cancer i see american manufacturing american workers racing to lead the global market i see farmers making agriculture the first in the world to achieve net zero emissions and in the process gaining new sources of income when donald trump thinks about led light bulbs he says he doesn't like them because the lights are no good they always make him look orange i see small businesses and master electricians designing and installing award-winning energy conservation measures rebuilding buildings across the country it's going to reduce electrical consumption and save businesses hundreds of thousands of dollars a year in energy cost well he turns against our allies i'll bring us back into the paris agreement i'll put us back in the business of leading the world on climate change and i'll challenge every other country to up the ante on climate commitments where he reverses the biden assuming the obama biden fuel efficiency standards he picks big oil he picks big oil companies over american workers even when the automobile industry agreed he'll not only bring the stand i don't want to bring the standards back i'll set new ambitious ones that our workers are ready to meet i'll also see american workers building and installing 500 000 electric vehicle charging stations along our newly engaged infrastructure programs and highways all across the country i see american consumers switching to electric vehicles through rebates and initiatives not only that the united states owns one of them and maintains an enormous fleet of vehicles and we're going to harness the purchasing power of our federal government to make sure we're buying electric vehicles they're made and sourced by union workers right here in the united states of america and together this will mean more than a million new jobs in the american auto industry you know and we'll do another big thing it'll put us on a path to achieving a carbon pollution free electric sector electricity sector by 2035 that no future president can come along and turn back transforming the electrical sector power to produce power without carbon pollution it'll be the greatest spur to job creation and economic competitiveness in the 21st century not to mention the positive benefits to our health and our environment we need to get to work right away we'll need scientists at the national labs and land-grant universities historic black colleges and universities to improve and innovate technologies needed to generate store and transmit this clean electric we need engineers to design and workers to manufacture these new products we'll need iron workers and welders to install them we'll need to become the world's largest exporter of these technologies creating even more jobs sourced in america we know how to do this the obama biden administration rescued the auto industry and helped them retool we made solar energy cost competitive with traditional energy and weatherize more than a million homes which is just the beginning if we get reelected and we'll do it again bigger and faster and better than before we'll also build 1.5 million new energy efficient homes and public housing units that will benefit our communities in three times over by eliminating an affordable housing crisis by increasing energy efficiency and by reducing the racial wealth gap linked to home ownership there are thousands of oil and natural gas wells that oil companies and gas companies have abandoned many of which are leaking toxins we create 250 000 jobs now by just plugging those wells right away good union jobs for energy workers this will help sustain communities and protect them from the environmental damage as well we'll also create new markets for our family farmers and ranchers we'll launch a new modern civilian climate corps to heal our public lands and make use of us less vulnerable make us much less vulnerable to wildfires and floods i believe that every american has a fundamental right to breathe clean air and drink clean water i know that we haven't fulfilled that right yet that's true of the millions of families struggling with the smoke-created devastation of the wildfires right now but it's also been true for a generation or more in places like cancer alley in louisiana or right here in delaware along the route 9 carter right here in delaware fulfilling this basic obligation to all americans especially in low-income white black brown and native american communities who too often don't have the clean air in the clean water is not going to be easy but it's necessary i'm committing to get it done these aren't pie in the sky dreams these are concrete actionable problems that create american jobs mitigate climate change and put our nation on the road to net zero emissions by no later than 2050. you know some say we can't afford to fix this but here's the thing look around at the crushing consequences of the extreme weather events i've been describing we've already been paying for it so we have a choice we can invest in our infrastructure to make us stronger more resilient improving the health of americans and creating millions of good paying jobs while at the same time tackling the root causes of climate change or we can continue down the path donald trump has on a path of indifference costing tens of billions of dollars to rebuild when the human costs the lives and the livelihoods and the homes and the communities destroyed are immeasurable we have a choice we can commit to doing this together because you know that climate change is the existential challenge that's going to determine our future as a country for our children our grandchildren and our great-grandchildren or we can do it donald trump's way ignore the facts deny reality which amounts to a full surrender and a failure to lead it's backward-looking politics that's going to harm the environment make communities less healthy and hold back economic progress while other countries race ahead and it's a mindset that doesn't have any faith in the capacity of the american people to compete to innovate and to win like the pandemic dealing with climate change is a global crisis that requires american leadership it requires a president for all americans so as the fires rage out west on this day our prayers remain with everyone under the ash i know it's hard to see the sun rise believing today will be a better day than yesterday americans face this historic inflection point a time of real peril but also a time of extraordinary possibilities i'm confident i know we can do this we will do this this is the united states of america we've seen the light through the dark smoke we never give up always without exception every time we succeed when we try may god bless our firefighters and keep them safe and our first responders may god protect our troops thank you very much i'm anxious to share what the president had to say thank you,b check check check one two one two three four check check check one two one two three four one two test test test one so so music so music applause PRON PRON good

PRON this past spring in midland michigan experience the flood so devastating with deadly flash flooding over running dam and roadway that have displace resident PRON be consider once in a year weather event but those once in many generation event PRON be now happen every year the past year be the hot decade ever record the arctic be literally melt part be actually on fire what PRON be see in america in PRON community be connect to all of this with every bout with nature fury cause by PRON own inaction on climate change more can more americans see and feel the devastation whether in a big city small town on coastline or in farmland PRON be happen everywhere and PRON be happen now and PRON affect PRON all nearly city not republican or democratic city city be experience the long stretch of deadly heat wave in year require PRON to help PRON poor and elderly resident adapt to the extreme heat to simply stay alive especially in the home without air conditioning which many do not have PRON family farmer in the midwest be face historic drought those follow record flood and hurricane speed by wind storm all this year the speed of those wind storm have be incredible when PRON see PRON on television or see PRON in person PRON be ravage million of acre of corn soybean and other crop PRON very livelihood which sustain PRON family and PRON economy for generation be now in jeopardy how PRON pay PRON bill this year will be leave to pass on to PRON kid and none of this be happen in a vacuum recent study show air pollution be link with increase risk of death from cover PRON economy can not recover if PRON can not build back with more resiliency more ability to withstand extreme weather extreme weather that will only come with great frequency and intensity the unrelenting impact of climate change affect every single solitary one of PRON but too often the brunt fall disproportionately on community of color exacerbate the need for example for environmental justice sorry as a bug speak of the environment these be interlock crisis of PRON time require action not denial require leadership not scapegoate PRON require the president to meet the threshold duty of the office to care to care for everyone to defend PRON from every attack see in unseen always and without exception because here be the deal hurricane do not swerve to avoid red state or blue state wildfire do not skip town that vote a certain way the impact of climate change do not pick and choose that be because PRON be not a partisan phenomenon PRON be science and PRON response should be the same ground in science act together all of PRON but like with PRON federal response to kova the lack of a national strategy on climate on climate change overall leave PRON with a patchwork of solution as a matter of fact PRON be be make bad by the change this administration have make PRON be speak from delaware PRON be the low lie state in the nation relative to sea level where just last week delaware state attorney general sue big fossil fuel company allege that PRON knowingly wreak havoc and damage on climate PRON climate damage that be plain for everyone to see but the president as PRON fly to california today PRON know PRON have no interest in meet this moment PRON know PRON will not listen to the expert or treat this disaster with the urgency PRON demand as any president should do during the national emergency PRON be already say PRON want to withhold aid to california to punish the people of california because PRON do not vote for PRON this be another crisis another crisis PRON will not take responsibility for the west be literally on fire and PRON blame the people whose home and community be burn PRON say quote PRON got to clean PRON floor PRON get to clean PRON forest this be the same president who throw paper towel on the people of puerto rico instead of truly help PRON recover and rebuild PRON know as disdain for PRON own military leader and PRON veteran just last year the defense department report that climate change be a direct threat to more than two two third of the military operationally critical installation that be what the military warn PRON and this could well be this could be a conservative estimate donald trump climate denial may not have cause these fire and record flood and record hurricane but if PRON get a second term these hellish event will continue to become more common more devastating and more deadly and meanwhile donald trump warn that integration be threaten PRON suburb PRON be ridiculous but PRON know what be actually threaten PRON suburb wildfire be burn the suburb in the west flood be wipe out suburban neighborhood in the midwest hurricane be imperil suburban life along PRON coast if PRON have four more year of trump climate denial how many suburb will be burn in wildfire how many suburban neighborhood will have be flood out how many suburb will have be blow away in super storm if PRON give a climate arsonist four more year in the white house why would anyone be surprised if PRON have more america blaze if PRON give a climate deni four more year in the white house why would anyone be surprised when more of america be under water PRON need a president to respect science who understand that the damage from climate change be already here unless PRON take urgent action PRON will soon be more catastrophic a president who recognize understand and care that americans be die which make president trump climate denialism PRON disdain for science and fact all the more unconscionable once again PRON fail the most basic duty to a nation PRON fail to protect PRON from the pandemic from an economic free fall from racial unrest from the ravage of climate change PRON be clear that PRON be not safe in donald trump america this be donald trump america PRON be in charge what PRON do not get be that even in a crisis there be nothing beyond the capacity of the american people when PRON stand up and act together and while so many of PRON be hurt right now i want PRON to know that if PRON give PRON the honor of serve as PRON president PRON can and PRON will meet this moment with urgency and purpose PRON can and PRON will solve the crime of the climate crisis and PRON will build back better than PRON be before PRON know when donald trump think about climate change PRON think hoax when i think about i think job good pay union job to put americans to work build a strong more climate resilient nation a nation modernize PRON have modernize water and transportation system an energy infrastructure to withstand the impact of extreme weather and change climate when donald trump think about renewable energy PRON see windmill somehow be cause cancer i see american manufacture american worker race to lead the global market i see farmer make agriculture the first in the world to achieve net zero emission and in the process gain new source of income when donald trump think about lead light bulb PRON say PRON do not like PRON because the light be no good PRON always make PRON look orange i see small business and master electrician design and instal award win energy conservation measure rebuild building across the country PRON be go to reduce electrical consumption and save business hundred of thousand of dollar a year in energy cost well PRON turn against PRON ally PRON will bring PRON back into the paris agreement PRON will put PRON back in the business of lead the world on climate change and PRON will challenge every other country to up the ante on climate commitment where PRON reverse the biden assume the obama biden fuel efficiency standard PRON pick big oil PRON pick big oil company over american worker even when the automobile industry agree PRON will not only bring the stand i do not want to bring the standard back PRON will set new ambitious one that PRON worker be ready to meet PRON will also see american worker building and instal electric vehicle charge station along PRON newly engage infrastructure program and highway all across the country i see american consumer switch to electric vehicle through rebate and initiative not only that the united states own one of PRON and maintain an enormous fleet of vehicle and PRON be go to harness the purchase power of PRON federal government to make sure PRON be buy electric vehicle PRON be make and source by union worker right here in the united states of america and together this will mean more than a million new job in the american auto industry PRON know and PRON will do another big thing PRON will put PRON on a path to achieve a carbon pollution free electric sector electricity sector by that no future president can come along and turn back transform the electrical sector power to produce power without carbon pollution PRON will be the great spur to job creation and economic competitiveness in the st century not to mention the positive benefit to PRON health and PRON environment PRON need to get to work right away PRON will need scientist at the national lab and land grant university historic black college and university to improve and innovate technology need to generate store and transmit this clean electric PRON need engineer to design and worker to manufacture these new product PRON will need iron worker and welder to install PRON PRON will need to become the world large exporter of these technology create even more job source in america PRON know how to do this the obama biden administration rescue the auto industry and help PRON retool PRON make solar energy cost competitive with traditional energy and weatherize more than a million home which be just the beginning if PRON get reelect and PRON will do PRON again big and faster and well than before PRON will also build million new energy efficient home and public housing unit that will benefit PRON community in three time over by eliminate an affordable housing crisis by increase energy efficiency and by reduce the racial wealth gap link to home ownership there be thousand of oil and natural gas well that oil company and gas company have abandon many of which be leak toxin PRON create job now by just plug those well right away good union job for energy worker this will help sustain community and protect PRON from the environmental damage as well PRON will also create new market for PRON family farmer and rancher PRON will launch a new modern civilian climate corp to heal PRON public land and make use of PRON less vulnerable make PRON much less vulnerable to wildfire and flood i believe that every american have a fundamental right to breathe clean air and drink clean water i know that PRON have not fulfil that right yet that be true of the million of family struggle with the smoke create devastation of the wildfire right now but PRON be also be true for a generation or more in place like cancer alley in louisiana or right here in delaware along the route carter right here in delaware fulfil this basic obligation to all americans especially in low income white black brown and native american community who too often do not have the clean air in the clean water be not go to be easy but PRON be necessary PRON be commit to get PRON do these be not pie in the sky dream these be concrete actionable problem that create american job mitigate climate change and put PRON nation on the road to net zero emission by no later than PRON know some say PRON can not afford to fix this but here be the thing look around at the crush consequence of the extreme weather event PRON have be describe PRON have already be pay for PRON so PRON have a choice PRON can invest in PRON infrastructure to make PRON strong more resilient improve the health of americans and create million of good pay job while at the same time tackle the root cause of climate change or PRON can continue down the path donald trump have on a path of indifference cost ten of billion of dollar to rebuild when the human cost the life and the livelihood and the home and the community destroy be immeasurable PRON have a choice PRON can commit to do this together because PRON know that climate change be the existential challenge that be go to determine PRON future as a country for PRON child PRON grandchild and PRON great grandchild or PRON can do PRON donald trump way ignore the fact deny reality which amount to a full surrender and a failure to lead PRON be backward look politic that be go to harm the environment make community less healthy and hold back economic progress while other country race ahead and PRON be a mindset that do not have any faith in the capacity of the american people to compete to innovate and to win like the pandemic deal with climate change be a global crisis that require american leadership PRON require a president for all americans so as the fire rage out west on this day PRON prayer remain with everyone under the ash i know PRON be hard to see the sun rise believe today will be a well day than yesterday americans face this historic inflection point a time of real peril but also a time of extraordinary possibility PRON be confident i know PRON can do this PRON will do this this be the united states of america PRON have see the light through the dark smoke PRON never give up always without exception every time PRON succeed when PRON try may god bless PRON firefighter and keep PRON safe and PRON first responder may god protect PRON troop thank PRON very much PRON be anxious to share what the president have to say thank PRON

so this so know okay so uh which optical wow so so okay so so so so check so so time hi nancy marshall ginser marketplace at sure paul i wanna we are in contact uh particularly on on on the two dissenters but they they consent they descended from thank you much so so now so this uh me oh so okay see here okay okay stretch yes let's go okay see cup yes oh foreign so oh so [Music] so so so yes so good afternoon everyone i as some of you know just concluded a hour and a half long briefing with seven of our nation's top public health experts on the state of the pandemic the steps we need to curb the spread of the virus and the challenges of distributing a safe and effective vaccine once one is identified before i turn to those issues let me say a few words about the president's comments last night even before acknowledging uh to bob woodward on tape that he was fully informed on the gravity of the danger related to cope at 19 he refused to warn the american people again last night in television town hall the president revealed in no uncertain terms the lack of seriousness with which he continues to take this pandemic nearly eight months after this crisis on the doorstep of two hundred thousand american deaths president trump has refused once again to take responsibility or to take action by his own admission he continued to lie about covert 19. he doubled down on the catastrophic mistakes that he's made and perhaps worst of all he made clear that he still doesn't have a plan to bring us out of this crisis even said and i quote a lot of people think that masks are not good undercutting the easiest most effective means we have for reducing the spread of this disease this virus is still taking nearly a thousand lives a day the forecasts show that those numbers are likely to climb this winter but incredibly donald trump insists that he wouldn't have done anything different not one thing last friday we learned that another one of the thousands americans died due to this virus and it continues to rise and the very same day that we reported a thousand deaths on friday and the very same day canada reported that not one person died of covet 19 in canada trump wouldn't have done anything differently if you're a parent in america preparing for another day that your child can't attend school if you're grieving the loss of a son a daughter a mother a father husband or wife if you're a small business owner who's on the brink of total bankruptcy you can't open or can't go back to work because the virus still is spreading your community how does it make you feel to the president say he wouldn't have done anything differently if he gets four more years why should we expect anything to change all president had to offer last night president trump was the same weak and feckless inaction the same lies and empty promises that we've seen from the very beginning he still won't accept any responsibility he still won't offer a plan and last night he repeated what he said so many times before that even if he continues to offer only failing indifference someday the virus is going to go away by america even if he does nothing it's going to go away by a miracle it won't go away like a miracle in fact even if it get able to get a vaccine will not be available for most populations are well into the 2021 you know so we're heading into a very dangerous autumn the fact that the university of washington model which the white house has previously touted projects that cases and deaths are going to spike this november and an additional by 215 000 americans they say you're gonna die begin the spike in november but by the first of the year 215 000 will be dead additional that's more than already died we need leadership right now to prevent that from happening the same university model shows the university of washington model shows that if if there's universal masking these deaths could be projected this could be cut in half we could say between now and the end of the year 100 000 lives let's assume they're off by half on all of this 50 000 lives 150 000 dead donald trump's own director of cdc told us that wearing a mask is a single most important step we can take to curb this virus here's what he said he said i might go so far as to say that this face mask and he held up a face mask not this one is more guaranteed to protect me against covet than when i take a covert vaccine end of quote i spoke with the experts today about additional steps we can take to prevent needless deaths and suffering between now and a universal vaccine being made available uniform national guidelines they said and standards on social distancing that can be applied to particular circumstances of states and communities based on their their particular circumstance more effective approaches on testing and tracing we do these things between now and january we could save even more lives last night donald trump indicated he has no interest in doing these things folks the president's first responsibility is to protect the american people and he won't that's utterly disqualified i also spoke to the experts this morning about the paramount importance of preparing now for swift organized and free distribution of a safe and effective cova 19 vaccine when it arrives and i'm profoundly grateful to the scientists and the researchers working tirelessly to ensure that a safe and effective vaccine becomes a reality as soon as possible these scientists carry the hopes of our nation our entire nation and the entire world when their work comes to fruition and it will there will be no doubt it will save lives but scientific breakthroughs don't care about calendars any more than the virus does they certainly don't adhere to election cycles and their timing their approval and their distribution should never ever be distorted by political considerations they should be determined by science and safety alone a vaccine would offer a way back to normal in a path toward better days for all of us not only here but around the world but it's not going to happen overnight once we have it it's going to take months to distribute it to the entire population i'm more hopeful than ever in the power of science to get us there but one thing is certain we can't allow politics to interfere with the vaccine in any way americans have had to endure president trump's incompetence and dishonesty when it comes to testing and personal protective equipment we can't afford to repeat those fiascos when it comes to a vaccine when it occurs the stakes are too high american families have already suffered and sacrificed too much so let me be clear i trust vaccines i trust scientists but i don't trust donald trump at this moment the american people can't either last week senator harris and i laid out three questions this administration is going to have to answer to assure the american people that politics will not play a role whatsoever in the vaccine process if donald trump can't give answers an administration can't give answers these three questions the american people should not have confidence but if they can they should have confidence in the transparency they need to trust a vaccine and adopt it in numbers that will make a difference first question what criteria will be used to ensure that a vaccine meets the scientific standard of safety and effectiveness what's the criteria second if the administration green lights a vaccine who will validate that the decision was driven by science rather than politics what group of scientists will that be and thirdly how can we be sure that the distribution of the vaccine will take place safely cost-free and without a hint of favoritism the fact of the matter is development vaccine is only part of the battle distributing a vaccine to the entire population is as complex and challenging as one of the most sensitive military operations i've been calling for an effective distribution plan to be laid out for months i'm elected president i'll begin by implementing an effective distribution plan from the minute i take office that's what i discussed with the experts in the briefing today they laid out a clear plan they include a detailed timetable for when people will get the vaccine clear deniation of priority of populations to get the vaccine a specific means and mechanism for shipping and storing vaccine in appropriate temperatures two of those vaccines if they're come forward they have to be stored and shifted 70 degrees below zero the division of responsibility at every level of government has to be clear and i will provide the leadership necessary to carry out that plan i'll level with the american people i'll take responsibility and i'll support rather than tear down the experts responsible for the day-to-day execution of the plan i'll simply follow the science the satisfactory answer to these two these three questions that senator harris and i have laid out every american including me and my family can have confidence in a safe and effective covenanting vaccine this isn't about politics it's about saving lives it's about getting back to our loved ones and our friends making sure they're safe it's about getting our economy back on his feet getting back to the movie theaters and restaurants and ballparks it's about getting back to our lives and getting america up off the mat i'm confident we can and will be united in that pursuit no matter when that breakthrough emerges in vaccines no matter when that hope bears fruit that's what america does at its best we unite we do it together and i'm confident we'll be able to just want to thank you god bless our scientists and researchers and our frontline workers and may god protect our troops i'll be happy to take some questions now if that's uh okay let me put my list here everybody's sitting okay abc mary thank you mr vice president you just said that when it comes to a vaccine you don't trust donald trump is there a risk that that message that questioning the president on a vaccine could prevent people from trusting the science from trusting a vaccine when there finally is one no because i know he doesn't have any respect for scientists he basically said you saw what he said when he was out in california about wildfires and scientists don't know and it's going to go away like a miracle it's necessary so people can trust the vaccine and that's why i said that you have to have this board of scientists or they're going to say this is why we think this is a good vaccine why it's approved and has to be total transparency so scientists outside the government know exactly what is being approved the context in which it's being approved and why it's being approved i think it's the only thing that takes care of that for a vaccine to work though to be effective you do need a certain amount of the population to be willing to take it you're saying don't trust the president trust me if i'm elected are you more confident than enough america trust the scientists trust the scientists it's one thing for donald trump to say the vaccine is safe okay then give it to the board of scientists have total transparency so independent operators and scientists and companies go out and take a look at it and what did you base that decision on what did you do did you pressure the head of the fda did you pressure whomever i'm not saying you would or will but that's what has to happen because you know yourself you all know the polls better than i do the american people right now don't trust what the president says about things relating to science and if the scientists say a vaccine under the president's watch is safe and effective absolutely do it yes if those three questions i laid out can be answered yes absolutely um caitlyn cbs thank you mr vice president just a quick follow-up on that you say that you don't trust the president does that mean you also don't trust the cdc and the fda currently no i don't trust some of the people like the fella who just took a leave of absence from the cdc he didn't run it but he was a spokesperson for it but there are some when i met with the seven scientists today on the screen here in this room they told me the people that they had worked with in the cdc and the fda and all the various agencies there's some very very good people there in the ranks the everyday folks that are not every day they're scientists but the people who do the daily work in there there's some very very good people but you know from other items that they've been squashed and things they've said and they've been pressured the heads of those agencies politically appointed some of them have been in fact moved moved to say yes we can do this or that or this will work or that work it's a simple proposition if your evapo is ready to go it should be totally transparent the basis upon which that decision was made washed and things they've said and they've been pressured and outside the government and said this is a useful safe vaccine to take so you gotta say what i'm saying and that's gonna and that's gonna be necessary i'd respectfully suggest no matter what i said in this process because all the pulling down because all the polling data is only 30 some percent of america if trump said it's okay this is the guy the same guy that said inject leech this is the same guy you know you want to keep hurricanes you know you want to keep hurricanes to the united states why don't we drop a new i mean you know there's a quick question on the economy uh the feds is for unemployment er we actually created more jobs in the last three years of our administration he created the first four years of his administration we actually had more equitable distribution among middle class folks and the like there were fewer people at risk but i think it's a matter of my being able to communicate my position on jobs and trade and what i would do and you know for example the world trade organization he loves to batter us around and we've supported the world trade or just ruled that his trade policies were illegal well guess what we went in with 14 15 16 times at the wto when we won every single time now why should any american remember that that was you know five six seven eight years ago so part of it is reminding people and laying out for them what my plan for economic recovery is but if people have questions about the economic fallout from the pandemic now you have said that you would have acted earlier what do you say to people who might question how the economic impact could have been different even if you acted earlier the social distancing and the closings would still be in place no not necessarily because you wouldn't be having the high rates of of reinfection that we have now you wouldn't be having a thousand people a day die you'd be able to open we need national guidance as of the basis upon which you can open up and it depends it varies within state to state so you may very well be able to open up in a rural area not a not a area that is a metropolitan area or vice versa because of the the degree to which the virus is rampant in that area we've not set anything out we've not laid out as this administration has not laid out the criteria there's no national criteria what's the national criteria for opening schools they still don't have one you need a national criteria and you need to be able to be sure excuse me that you can open safely and securely you can have social distancing you can have the wearing of mass you can have smaller classes you need more teachers a whole range of things but why won't he lay out the guidance and even when the cdc initially had stronger guidance what happened talk about political manipulation he said no no don't put those out don't put those out because the president was then saying by the way testing just causes more cause it causes more cases to show it's about being honest you know he loves to quote churchill he loves to quote roosevelt well you know roosevelt said in a crisis in world war ii he said it's going to get worse and worse and worse till it gets better and better and better the one thing you have to tell the american people they're strong give it to them straight straight from the shoulder they can handle anything that's what i'll do um cnn jessica thanks mr vice president uh you mentioned the cdc director's comments this morning about the vaccine and how i'm sorry about masks and how critical they are you've previously called for a mask mandate a national mask mandate if you were elected what steps would you take to put that in place and and how would that work well first of all i found it fascinating the president said and biden didn't put in a mass mandate i don't know how old he's about you i'm not the president he's the president it's like you know biden's problems in these cities are inflamed i'm not the president he's the president i would make i would call all the governors to the white house and say and because there's a question i think it can be answered in the positive a question whether i can mandate over state lines that every single state has to comply our legal team thinks i can do that based upon the degree to which there's a crisis in those states and how bad things are for the country and if we don't do it what happens but i would make the case i'd make the case why it's necessary i'd have the scientists to raid to lay out in detail why and i would go to every governor and i'd go to governors related republican and democratic governors and i'd say we have to have this national mandate we must do it and at a minimum what i would do i wouldn't walk around saying mass don't matter like he said it's your town hall i think it was last night i saw the tail end of it that well you know uh you know mass you know people don't don't like mask matter of fact they could be worse and i think don't hold me to this because they didn't see it as what reported and they yeah and stephanopoulos asked why and he said because waiters don't like him waiters touch the food and touch the mask i mean come on but what would happen if say a republican governor pushed back on you on this how do you get buy-in when it's become so politicized would you sign an executive order well the question is whether i have the legal authority as president signed an executive order we think we do but i don't i can't guarantee you that yet but if you did you would if i did i would thank you sir thank you number five uh i have to call on my hometown paper the news journal meredith sir in terms of the distribution of the virus communities of color have been greatly affected would they get access to the virus first how would that work in terms of the distribution of americans being able to get the virus based on the proposal laid out by the experts i spoke of today and the national science foundation is coordinating with the cdc and other agencies they indicate that the first group of people that should get the vaccine if and when it is available are people at the greatest risk and that includes everything from nursing homes to people with serious pre-existing conditions that would cause people to be in real trouble a lot of those people happen to be black and brown happen to be black and brown and so it would be based upon the degree of explosion it would go first though i would argue but i have a scientific board laid out for me it would go first as laid out for me today to first responders doctors and nurses the people who most we're most needed to have available to deal with our crises health as well as physical crises in in our communities that would be the first and it would move to the least now one thing that hasn't happened yet and uh i don't want to and i am not a scientist although i hope i'm well informed on this issue there have been no tests yet on children so children ironically may be the last people to get the vaccine because it's going to take time in the they indicated to me in 2021 to be able to do the kind of testing on children children are less likely to die although they can and it's more likely that their teachers and the elderly prayer elderly grandparents etc would be exposed so the first would go to the people most susceptible but children are going to have to be part of this but there's a lot more work that has to be done there but no trials done yet on children and today the government released a plan and how they would or a loose plan on how they would distribute the vaccine if you're elected would you reverse course on the plan that the federal government has already put in place no they haven't put one in place for real yet number one number two i haven't seen the detail of it and it may be it may be a very good plan as is but what i would do is make sure that i brought in all of the experts to make sure what is the best and most rad most rational means of distribution now look there are two types of vaccines being worked on now one is an rna model that are done by two of the of the operations i think moderna and uh um i figured which one who has the other one and the other is an adenovirus which is a way to generate the immune system to respond one changes the cell structure the one that deals with the the the the mrna that requires two injections and it requires to be stored at 70 degrees below zero so in addition to all this there are mechanical issues as to how and where the vaccine assuming let's say the moderna one is picked assuming that the vaccine is approved it's a very very significant difficult problem how you distribute that vaccine for example you couldn't you have to ship it in bulk if it's if it's the mrna version and that means you know thousands of a thousand at a time kind of thing that means it's going to go to hospitals and major distribution medical distribution centers it's not going to go to your doctor like you and you can't show up at walgreens like i did the other and i did my doc gave it to me but my flu shot but i used to get my flu shot at walgreens you can't do that because you can't do it in small lots you have to have two shots two of them and so my generic point is there are a lot of not only what is safe to do but distribution issues that are consequential and matter a lot and so it's not like by the way if i told you tomorrow if i said if i were president said we have approved the following two vaccines or one vaccine well the vaccines that are likely to be approved so far are start off with a a group of 10 000 doses all the way to 60 000 doses well you know there are millions of people it's going to take and then you get up to several million but it takes time is what i'm saying and it has to be done fairly and well it can't be based on your tax returns figuratively speaking it's got to be based on who is most

conclude a hour and a half long briefing with seven of PRON nation top public health expert on the state of the pandemic the step PRON need to curb the spread of the virus and the challenge of distribute a safe and effective vaccine once one be identify before i turn to those issue let PRON say a few word about the president comment last night even before acknowledge uh to bob woodward on tape that PRON be fully inform on the gravity of the danger relate to cope at PRON refuse to warn the american people again last night in television town hall the president reveal in no uncertain term the lack of seriousness with which PRON continue to take this pandemic nearly eight month after this crisis on the doorstep of two hundred thousand american death president trump have refuse once again to take responsibility or to take action by PRON own admission PRON continue to lie about covert PRON double down on the catastrophic mistake that PRON be make and perhaps bad of all PRON make clear that PRON still do not have a plan to bring PRON out of this crisis even say and i quote a lot of people think that mask be not good undercutting the easy most effective mean PRON have for reduce the spread of this disease this virus be still take nearly a thousand live a day the forecast show that those number be likely to climb this winter but incredibly donald trump insist that PRON would not have do anything different not one thing last friday PRON learn that another one of the thousand americans die due to this virus and PRON continue to rise and the very same day that PRON report a thousand death on friday and the very same day canada report that not one person die of covet in canada trump would not have do anything differently if PRON be a parent in america prepare for another day that PRON child can not attend school if PRON be grieve the loss of a son a daughter a mother a father husband or wife if PRON be a small business owner who be on the brink of total bankruptcy PRON can not open or can not go back to work because the virus still be spread PRON community how do PRON make PRON feel to the president say PRON would not have do anything differently if PRON get four more year why should PRON expect anything to change all president have to offer last night president trump be the same weak and feckless inaction the same lie and empty promise that PRON have see from the very beginning PRON still will not accept any responsibility PRON still will not offer a plan and last night PRON repeat what PRON say so many time before that even if PRON continue to offer only fail indifference someday the virus be go to go away by america even if PRON do nothing PRON be go to go away by a miracle PRON will not go away like a miracle in fact even if PRON get able to get a vaccine will not be available for most population be well into the PRON know so PRON be head into a very dangerous autumn the fact that the university of washington model which the white house have previously tout project that case and death be go to spike this november and an additional by americans PRON say PRON be go to die begin the spike in november but by the first of the year will be dead additional that be more than already die PRON need leadership right now to prevent that from happen the same university model show the university of washington model show that if if there be universal mask these death could be project this could be cut in half PRON could say between now and the end of the year life let PRON assume PRON be off by half on all of this live dead donald trump own director of cdc tell PRON that wear a mask be a single most important step PRON can take to curb this virus here be what PRON say PRON say i may go so far as to say that this face mask and PRON hold up a face mask not this one be more guarantee to protect PRON against covet than when i take a covert vaccine end of quote i speak with the expert today about additional step PRON can take to prevent needless death and suffering between now and a universal vaccine be make available uniform national guideline PRON say and standard on social distancing that can be apply to particular circumstance of state and community base on PRON PRON particular circumstance more effective approach on testing and tracing PRON do these thing between now and january PRON could save even more life last night donald trump indicate PRON have no interest in do these thing folk the president first responsibility be to protect the american people and PRON will not that be utterly disqualified i also speak to the expert this morning about the paramount importance of prepare now for swift organized and free distribution of a safe and effective cova vaccine when PRON arrive and PRON be profoundly grateful to the scientist and the researcher work tirelessly to ensure that a safe and effective vaccine become a reality as soon as possible these scientist carry the hope of PRON nation PRON entire nation and the entire world when PRON work come to fruition and PRON will there will be no doubt PRON will save life but scientific breakthrough do not care about calendars any more than the virus do PRON certainly do not adhere to election cycle and PRON time PRON approval and PRON distribution should never ever be distort by political consideration PRON should be determine by science and safety alone a vaccine would offer a way back to normal in a path toward well day for all of PRON not only here but around the world but PRON be not go to happen overnight once PRON have PRON PRON be go to take month to distribute PRON to the entire population PRON be more hopeful than ever in the power of science to get PRON there but one thing be certain PRON can not allow politic to interfere with the vaccine in any way americans have have to endure president trump incompetence and dishonesty when PRON come to testing and personal protective equipment PRON can not afford to repeat those fiasco when PRON come to a vaccine when PRON occur the stake be too high american family have already suffer and sacrifice too much so let PRON be clear i trust vaccine i trust scientist but i do not trust donald trump at this moment the american people can not either last week senator harris and i lay out three question this administration be go to have to answer to assure the american people that politic will not play a role whatsoever in the vaccine process if donald trump can not give answer an administration can not give answer these three question the american people should not have confidence but if PRON can PRON should have confidence in the transparency PRON need to trust a vaccine and adopt PRON in number that will make a difference first question what criterion will be use to ensure that a vaccine meet the scientific standard of safety and effectiveness what be the criterion second if the administration green light a vaccine who will validate that the decision be drive by science rather than politic what group of scientist will that be and thirdly how can PRON be sure that the distribution of the vaccine will take place safely cost free and without a hint of favoritism the fact of the matter be development vaccine be only part of the battle distribute a vaccine to the entire population be as complex and challenging as one of the most sensitive military operation PRON have be call for an effective distribution plan to be lay out for month PRON be elect president PRON will begin by implement an effective distribution plan from the minute i take office that be what i discuss with the expert in the briefing today PRON lay out a clear plan PRON include a detailed timetable for when people will get the vaccine clear deniation of priority of population to get the vaccine a specific mean and mechanism for shipping and store vaccine in appropriate temperature two of those vaccine if PRON be come forward PRON have to be store and shift degree below zero the division of responsibility at every level of government have to be clear and i will provide the leadership necessary to carry out that plan PRON will level with the american people PRON will take responsibility and PRON will support rather than tear down the expert responsible for the day to day execution of the plan PRON will simply follow the science the satisfactory answer to these two these three question that senator harris and i have lay out every american include PRON and PRON family can have confidence in a safe and effective covenanting vaccine this be not about politic PRON be about save live PRON be about get back to PRON loved one and PRON friend make sure PRON be safe PRON be about get PRON economy back on PRON foot get back to the movie theater and restaurant and ballpark PRON be about get back to PRON life and get america up off the mat PRON be confident PRON can and will be unite in that pursuit no matter when that breakthrough emerge in vaccine no matter when that hope bear fruit that be what america do at PRON good PRON unite PRON do PRON together and PRON be confident PRON will be able to just want to thank PRON god bless PRON scientist and researcher and PRON frontline worker and may god protect PRON troop PRON will be happy to take some question now if that be uh okay let PRON put PRON list here everybody sit okay abc mary thank PRON mr vice president PRON just say that when PRON come to a vaccine PRON do not trust donald trump be there a risk that that message that question the president on a vaccine could prevent people from trust the science from trust a vaccine when there finally be one no because i know PRON do not have any respect for scientist PRON basically say PRON see what PRON say when PRON be out in california about wildfire and scientist do not know and PRON be go to go away like a miracle PRON be necessary so people can trust the vaccine and that be why i say that PRON have to have this board of scientist or PRON be go to say this be why PRON think this be a good vaccine why PRON be approve and have to be total transparency so scientist outside the government know exactly what be be approve the context in which PRON be be approve and why PRON be be approve i think PRON be the only thing that take care of that for a vaccine to work though to be effective PRON do need a certain amount of the population to be willing to take PRON PRON be say do not trust the president trust PRON if PRON be elect be PRON more confident than enough america trust the scientist trust the scientist PRON be one thing for donald trump to say the vaccine be safe okay then give PRON to the board of scientist have total transparency so independent operator and scientist and company go out and take a look at PRON and what do PRON base that decision on what do PRON do do PRON pressure the head of the fda do PRON pressure whomever PRON be not say PRON would or will but that be what have to happen because PRON know PRON PRON all know the poll better than i do the american people right now do not trust what the president say about thing relate to science and if the scientist say a vaccine under the president watch be safe and effective absolutely do PRON yes if those three question i lay out can be answer yes absolutely um caitlyn cbs thank PRON mr vice president just a quick follow up on that PRON say that PRON do not trust the president do that mean PRON also do not trust the cdc and the fda currently no i do not trust some of the people like the fella who just take a leave of absence from the cdc PRON do not run PRON but PRON be a spokesperson for PRON but there be some when i meet with the seven scientist today on the screen here in this room PRON tell PRON the people that PRON have work with in the cdc and the fda and all the various agency there be some very very good people there in the rank the everyday folk that be not every day PRON be scientist but the people who do the daily work in there there be some very very good people but PRON know from other item that PRON have be squash and thing PRON have say and PRON have be pressure the head of those agency politically appoint some of PRON have be in fact move move to say yes PRON can do this or that or this will work or that work PRON be a simple proposition if PRON evapo be ready to go PRON should be totally transparent the basis upon which that decision be make washed and thing PRON have say and PRON have be pressure and outside the government and say this be a useful safe vaccine to take so PRON get to say what PRON be say and that be go to and that be go to be necessary PRON would respectfully suggest no matter what i say in this process because all the pull down because all the polling data be only some percent of america if trump say PRON be okay this be the guy the same guy that say inject leech this be the same guy PRON know PRON want to keep hurricane PRON know PRON want to keep hurricane to the united states why do not PRON drop a new i mean PRON know there be a quick question on the economy uh the fed be for unemployment er PRON actually create more job in the last three year of PRON administration PRON create the first four year of PRON administration PRON actually have more equitable distribution among middle class folk and the like there be few people at risk but i think PRON be a matter of PRON be able to communicate PRON position on job and trade and what i would do and PRON know for example the world trade organization PRON love to batter PRON around and PRON have support the world trade or just rule that PRON trade policy be illegal well guess what PRON go in with time at the wto when PRON win every single time now why should any american remember that that be PRON know five six seven eight year ago so part of PRON be remind people and lay out for PRON what PRON plan for economic recovery be but if people have question about the economic fallout from the pandemic now PRON have say that PRON would have act earlier what do PRON say to people who may question how the economic impact could have be different even if PRON act earlier the social distancing and the closing would still be in place no not necessarily because PRON would not be have the high rate of of reinfection that PRON have now PRON would not be have a thousand people a day die PRON would be able to open PRON need national guidance as of the basis upon which PRON can open up and PRON depend PRON vary within state to state so PRON may very well be able to open up in a rural area not a not a area that be a metropolitan area or vice versa because of the the degree to which the virus be rampant in that area PRON have not set anything out PRON have not lay out as this administration have not lay out the criterion there be no national criterion what be the national criterion for open school PRON still do not have one PRON need a national criterion and PRON need to be able to be sure excuse PRON that PRON can open safely and securely PRON can have social distancing PRON can have the wear of mass PRON can have small class PRON need more teacher a whole range of thing but why will not PRON lay out the guidance and even when the cdc initially have strong guidance what happen talk about political manipulation PRON say no no do not put those out do not put those out because the president be then say by the way test just cause more cause PRON cause more case to show PRON be about be honest PRON know PRON love to quote churchill PRON love to quote roosevelt well PRON know roosevelt say in a crisis in world war ii PRON say PRON be go to get bad and bad and bad till PRON get well and better and well the one thing PRON have to tell the american people PRON be strong give PRON to PRON straight straight from the shoulder PRON can handle anything that be what PRON will do um cnn jessica thank mr vice president uh PRON mention the cdc director comment this morning about the vaccine and how PRON be sorry about mask and how critical PRON be PRON have previously call for a mask mandate a national mask mandate if PRON be elect what step would PRON take to put that in place and and how would that work well first of all i find PRON fascinate the president say and biden do not put in a mass mandate i do not know how old PRON be about PRON PRON be not the president PRON be the president PRON be like PRON know biden problem in these city be inflame PRON be not the president PRON be the president i would make i would call all the governor to the white house and say and because there be a question i think PRON can be answer in the positive a question whether i can mandate over state line that every single state have to comply PRON legal team think i can do that base upon the degree to which there be a crisis in those state and how bad thing be for the country and if PRON do not do PRON what happen but i would make the case PRON would make the case why PRON be necessary PRON would have the scientist to raid to lay out in detail why and i would go to every governor and PRON would go to governor relate republican and democratic governor and PRON would say PRON have to have this national mandate PRON must do PRON and at a minimum what i would do i would not walk around say mass do not matter like PRON say PRON be PRON town hall i think PRON be last night i see the tail end of PRON that well PRON know uh PRON know mass PRON know people do not do not like mask matter of fact PRON could be bad and i think do not hold PRON to this because PRON do not see PRON as what report and PRON yeah and stephanopoulos ask why and PRON say because waiter do not like PRON waiter touch the food and touch the mask i mean come on but what would happen if say a republican governor push back on PRON on this how do PRON get buy in when PRON be become so politicized would PRON sign an executive order well the question be whether i have the legal authority as president sign an executive order PRON think PRON do but i do not i can not guarantee PRON that yet but if PRON do PRON would if i do i would thank PRON sir thank PRON number five uh i have to call on PRON hometown paper the news journal meredith sir in term of the distribution of the virus community of color have be greatly affect would PRON get access to the virus first how would that work in term of the distribution of americans be able to get the virus base on the proposal lay out by the expert i speak of today and the national science foundation be coordinate with the cdc and other agency PRON indicate that the first group of people that should get the vaccine if and when PRON be available be people at the great risk and that include everything from nursing home to people with serious pre existing condition that would cause people to be in real trouble a lot of those people happen to be black and brown happen to be black and brown and so PRON would be base upon the degree of explosion PRON would go first though i would argue but i have a scientific board lay out for PRON PRON would go first as lay out for PRON today to first responder doctor and nurse the people who most PRON be most need to have available to deal with PRON crisis health as well as physical crisis in in PRON community that would be the first and PRON would move to the least now one thing that have not happen yet and uh i do not want to and i be not a scientist although i hope PRON be well informed on this issue there have be no test yet on child so child ironically may be the last people to get the vaccine because PRON be go to take time in the PRON indicate to PRON in to be able to do the kind of testing on child child be less likely to die although PRON can and PRON be more likely that PRON teacher and the elderly prayer elderly grandparent etc would be expose so the first would go to the people most susceptible but child be go to have to be part of this but there be a lot more work that have to be do there but no trial do yet on child and today the government release a plan and how PRON would or a loose plan on how PRON would distribute the vaccine if PRON be elect would PRON reverse course on the plan that the federal government have already put in place no PRON have not put one in place for real yet number one number two i have not see the detail of PRON and PRON may be PRON may be a very good plan as be but what i would do be make sure that i bring in all of the expert to make sure what be the good and most rad most rational mean of distribution now look there be two type of vaccine be work on now one be an rna model that be do by two of the of the operation i think moderna and uh um i figure which one who have the other one and the other be an adenovirus which be a way to generate the immune system to respond one change the cell structure the one that deal with the the the the mrna that require two injection and PRON require to be store at degree below zero so in addition to all this there be mechanical issue as to how and where the vaccine assume let PRON say the moderna one be pick assume that the vaccine be approve PRON be a very very significant difficult problem how PRON distribute that vaccine for example PRON could not PRON have to ship PRON in bulk if PRON be if PRON be the mrna version and that mean PRON know thousand of a thousand at a time kind of thing that mean PRON be go to go to hospital and major distribution medical distribution center PRON be not go to go to PRON doctor like PRON and PRON can not show up at walgreen like i do the other and i do PRON doc give PRON to PRON but PRON flu shoot but i use to get PRON flu shot at walgreens PRON can not do that because PRON can not do PRON in small lot PRON have to have two shot two of PRON and so PRON generic point be there be a lot of not only what be safe to do but distribution issue that be consequential and matter a lot and so PRON be not like by the way if i tell PRON tomorrow if i say if i be president say PRON have approve the follow two vaccine or one vaccine well the vaccine that be likely to be approve so far be start off with a a group of dose all the way to dose well PRON know there be million of people PRON be go to take and then PRON get up to several million but PRON take time be what PRON be say and PRON have to be do fairly and well PRON can not be base on PRON tax return figuratively speak PRON be get to be base on who be most vulnerable who be most vulnerable okay thank PRON all so very very much thank PRON mr ryden do PRON plan to give anyone uh any cabinet decision before the election
95,D6vsf9t-pSc,biden,2020-09-18T20:54:55Z,"Joe Biden Speaks LIVE from Hermantown, Minnesota | Joe Biden For President 2020",speech,">> Please welcome
Senator Tina Smith. >> Good afternoon
everyone. I am glad to be
with you all. I think the comforters
to welcome us to this amazing apprenticeship
program. I'm excited to be here. We are all here because we all
understand that when people have the right
to come together collectively, to
organize for better working conditions,
better wages, safer places to work they do
better and their families to better and
everybody in this country does better. What I've learned from
talking to hard-working people all over
Minnesota is that what they want is the freedom
and opportunity to build the lives that they want
and they know that good jobs and their labor
union help them do that. So I think about what is happening here
in this amazing a ship facility that the vice
president has had a chance to tour the
distant great work is creating pathways for
people to have good jobs and good careers with
pensions and this is what is so important for
making this country work and making people's
lives work. We know what to do to
make this country work for everybody and not
just those that are at the top. Involves making sure
wages are good. We need a $15 hour
minimum wage and make sure we have paid family
medical leave and we need to make sure people
work hard and that they can count on their
pensions being there when they retire. This is a real challenge
for a lot of people these days. I've talked to people in
Duluth who have told me that they have done
everything right. Worked on weekends, work
on holidays paid into their pensions and now
being told that this pensions may
not be there. Think about what
that means. A woman said to me that
she does not have a plan B. There isn't another
option for her. So one of the things I'm
so proud to stand with Vice President Biden
on and the senator is standing up for the
rights of people to have the pensions that
they have earned. As we think about this
most important election there is no doubt about
who is standing with working people in
Minnesota and all across this country and that is
Vice President Biden and that is where I stand
as well in this most important Senate
election. A couple of days ago
Vice President Biden said I think this
campaign is a choice between whether your
for Scranton or for Park Avenue. Is this campaign about
Scranton or Park Avenue. I know what side
I come down. I come down on Scranton
and on the side of Vice President Biden. So thank you all so much
for being here and am excited to be a part of
the celebration of the hard work and what that
hardware can deliver for families in terms of
opportunities to build the lives they want. Thank you so much. >> And now Senator Amy L . >> Hello everyone it is
wonderful to be here. Thinking to the
carpenters for hosting us. Thank you to my friend
Tina Smith who is doing such a great job and I'm
so proud to have her as a colleague and
a real friend. People say friend in
Washington all the time but for us it is true. But to also be here and
to welcome back Vice President Biden to
northern Minnesota. He has been here with me. He has been up here with
our steelworkers. He is been up here
because you did such great work on domestic
violence and came to Duluth to talk about
it and now he is here with the carpenters. I was just talking to
the vice president backstage and recounting
my background here. I think you all know my dad grew up in
northern Minnesota, my grampa was a minor. He worked 1500 feet
underground his entire life. He never got to graduate
from middle school or high school because he
had nine brothers and sisters. It was unions that made
my grampa's life safer. My dad still remembers
those bodies in the Catholic Church at Saint
Anthony's because it was not safe. Even when my debt was
going up that was happening and the unions
pushed for safer roles and they pushed
for better wages . It's one of the only
reasons and standing up here today. So we know there's
something else going on in our country where
we need someone to have our back. I am sick and tired of
hearing Donald Trump say that he is somehow
making us more safe . We are not safe we have
a pandemic reaching across our country right
go visit my dad who is now 92 at assisted
living and he has COVID and I'm looking at him through a glass door
like I was two months ago and I don't even
know from going to see him again. That is not safe. And it's not safe when
people are scared economically and
they don't know if they're going to
have the job back. What I love about Joe
Biden and my friend Kamala Harris is there looking at not
just how we get through this pandemic but also
looking at the day after tomorrow and how we are
going to train our workers. What jobs we have
available now and what jobs we have available
in the future. We need a president who
will fight for those who lost their jobs because
this administration is selling American workers
out when we need to buy American. We need a president who
will fight for the people and workers of
northern Minnesota and not go down to Meera
Lago until all of his rich friends after he
passes the tax bill that you just got
a lot richer. I don't think one person
from northern Minnesota was in that room in
Florida when he said that. We need a president who
knows we do not have a shortage of CEOs. We have a shortage
of plumbers. A shortage of
construction workers. We have a shortage of
people that build things. That really build
things. Joe Biden is going to be
a president for all of America. I was so proud to
endorse him after starting my campaign in
the middle of a litter blizzard in Minnesota. I got into it by
endorsing Joe Biden and I cannot think of a more
joyful way to in the campaign. One last thing
I want to say. It was the Obama Biden administration
that came appear in the face of Dennis
McDonough, the Chief of Staff of President Obama
and made sure we did something about Chinese
steel dumping. They went to work,
enforced the laws, we passed new laws, and the
number of other iron ore mines reopened. It was there
administration that got results. So if you're worried
about your family and your job. You have a home
with Joe Biden. If you're worried about
the cost of prescription drugs or childcare hue
have a home with Joe Biden. And if you're worried
about the divide in this country and having a
president that just keeps adding more fuel
to the flames, you have a home with Joe Biden
because he wakes up every morning and thanks
how can I lead this country and bring
people together. Luckily just like
the carpenters. We are not afraid to
roll up our sleeves. I have this (VOTES)
Because this is the first day of early
voting and Minnesota. So let us go out there,
let us vote, let us roll up our sleeves and get
to work and elect Joe Biden as president of
the United States. Thank you very much. What >> And now please
welcome corporate training Institute
Executive Director Matt. >> Thank you. I would like to welcome
all of you to the Jerry and the
intercampus of the Carpenters training
Institute. Our mission here is to
prepare or 2500 registered apprentices
for successful career as a professor of
professional in the construction industry. We also provide
continuing education for all of our membership. Our partner contractors
are relying on the continued success of our
programs and our members in order to thrive. On behalf of the
north-central state regional Council of
Carpenters and the corporate training
Institute and our membership, I would like
to think Vice President Joe Biden for taking the
time to learn more about what the UBC members in
our region do and also hear what issues are
important to us. Without further delay
it is my pleasure to introduce Vice President
Joe Biden. >> Hello Minnesota. It is good to be back. As Amy was saying I
have been here a number of times up in the iron
ranges and is in a magnificent part
of the world. A magnificent part
of the world. I want to thank you so
much, Amy and Senator. You have been a great
friend and a great great Senator and Senator
Smith there is something else. I can tell you what. Thank you for the job
you're doing and I'm counting on it to
continue for another six years. I know you are both
fighting around-the clock to take care of
Minnesota who are hurting in these moments
of crisis we face today. We have everything from
COVID to unemployment to a country that is divided along or is being
divided along racist lines and we have
institutional racism we have to deal with. All range of things. The people of Minnesota
know that they have two of the best senators in
the country on their side. Matt, thank you so much
for the introduction and for showing
me around today. This incredible
apprentice program at the Carpenters training
center. What a lot of people do
not know if they are not involved with labor is
that apprenticeship programs is not only training the best
workers in the world and I'm not being facetious,
that is a fact. But they get paid while
they are doing it. They are getting paid not for full wages but
they're getting paid while they are doing it
and that is why these union and British
programs are so so so critically important
that they stay this way. It matters. People can still make it
while they are learning a trade. I trade that will put
them in good stead for the rest of their lives. It was great to see some
of the practical hands-on experience
that apprentices and journeymen men and
women here receive. While earning a wage
as a benefit. It is a bit quieter here
because of COVID-19 restrictions. But the pride of these
workers who are learning the skills that will
carry them throughout their careers is still unmistakable. My father, I apologize
to the press who followed me for
repeating this, but if I do not say every time,
my dad used to have an expression. He said Joey in jobs by a lot more
than paycheck. It is about your
dignity. It's about your respect. Your place in
the community. An easy and space-saving
looking kid in the eye and say it's going to be
OK and mean it was that is the lesson I have
never forgotten. It is the way I grew
up surrounded by hard-working families in
Scranton Pennsylvania and a lot of
steelworkers in Delaware and all those jobs
are gone now. And that is what I saw
here this training center. Dedicated women and men
investing in their dignity. In their dignity. Here in the iron Range
you can see the resilience in the grip
of the communities that have built
America. The metal that
it is made of. Fortified by the
strength of union power, worker power. I think I was saying
to you that my dad has another expression
the only way to do with the abuse of power is
with power and the only were real power for
workers in America is union power. You are the people that
keeps the barbarians on the other side of the
gate and make sure people can make
a decent living. Folks here like
everywhere else the times are hard. Unemployment is way up
due to the pandemic, few workers can be on the
job at one time. In order to abide by
social distancing rules. The economic outlook for
next year including for the building trades is
more uncertain than it need be. Here in Minnesota and
all across the country there are plenty of
people her head hurting. They are worried about
making the next mortgage payment. Keeping the rent
payments in check. They see the people at
the top of the heap doing very well. An incredible number. Billionaires and America
during this pandemic have made over
$300 billion. Did you hear what
I just said? In the middle of a
pandemic you are left to wonder is the consequence, who
is looking out for the ordinary folks. That is been the entire
story of Donald Trump's presidency. Now in the midst of this
unprecedented national crisis trump has given
up on even pretending to do his job. Almost 200,000 laws
lives lost in the last six months and experts
tell us now the same studies that we relied
on, the administration relied on to predict
what's coming next. That we will lose
another 215,000 lives between now and
January 1. The United States has
lost another 36,000 new COVID cases per day. Per day. Another average 1000
deaths a day. Just across the border,
figure really speaking a stones throw
indicated that, one day earlier this month
the United States the United States had a
thousand deaths of COVID in Canada had zero. Just three days ago
I believe it was. America had 1200
deaths, Canada had nine , nine . So many lives lost
unnecessarily because the president is only worried about
the stock market in his reelection. He refused to do what
you are doing right here in this program. Social distance, wear
masks, sanitize. You're protecting your
apprentices and he is not protecting America. It is estimated by the
scientists that if we just wore masks
nationally we would save 100,000 lives between
now and January 1. Let me say that again. If we would just wear
masks nationally we would save 100,000 lives
between now and January according to the
same study. It was estimated by
great medical school, the Columbia medical
school that if the president had just
started one week earlier in March then he did we
would have 36,000 more people sitting at the
dinner table tonight. Being able to put your
arm around grampa or grandma tonight. Again in his own words recorded by Bob
Woodward, the president knew back in February that this was
an extremely dangerous communicable disease. Think about it. How many people across
the iron Range , how many empty chairs
around the dinner tables , because of his
negligence and selfishness. How many lies said and lives lost . Imagine if you just at the state of the
union that year spoke up and said we have a
problem and we can handle it and here's
what we have to do. I cannot think
of any president who is ever active, in
my view, so selfishly. On his own reelection. Instead of his
sworn obligation to protect and defend
the American people. As I said last night in my hometown , I view this campaign
is between Scranton and part of Park Avenue. All trump sees from Park
Avenue is Wall Street. That is why the only
metric of the American press for him is the
value of the Dow Jones. Like a lot of US but
a lot of my life with guys like Donald
Trump looking down on me. Looking down the people
who make a living with her hands. People who take care
of our kids. People who cleaner
streets. Maybe what bothers me
most is the way he talks about to make sources
confirmed by many outlets. Where he is talked about
the men and women who join the military and
gave full measure to their country
as suckers. And losers. Unless you think it is
made up remember how you talked about Jon McCain. A political opponent
but a close friend when I was at
his eulogy. Jon McCain was no sucker or loser . He was a hero.. My son who volunteer
to spend to year in a rack and won the
bronze star. He was a loser
or sucker. He was a proud patriot. These are the guys who
is thought they were better than me,
better than us. Because they had
a lot of money. Guys who inherit
everything under God and still
managed to squander. I have to admit which I
guess is coming out and it is pretty obvious
particularly related to trauma. I have a little bit of
a chip on my shoulder with these guys. Recently I probably should not
have said that last night but I did, recently I read some stories
I was asked questions by leading columnist . That went like this. If you get elected you
to be the first guy in a long time elected
president without an Ivy League degree. Like somehow I kid who went to
the state University can qualify to be
president of the United States without an
Ivy League degree. Let me tell you
something. I know how to do the
job of being president it is pretty clear . No matter how wealthy
Donald Trump is or how much he doctors , if he does his
tax returns. He does not have a clue
how to be president . One of the lessons my
mother taught me, not a joke, long time ago, taught
me and my siblings and one that you were
probably taught to . She said Joey, remember
nobody is better than you but everybody
is your equal. Nobody is better than you , everybody is your equal . We don't measure people
by the size of their bank accounts I don't respect people
based on how big their house they live in is. I don't look down my
nose at people who are busting their next just
to make a living . Trump says, by the way everybody's in
the stock market and that's what he
cares about the stock market for stop what the hell is
he talking about? People why group within
Scranton didn't have money in stocks. Every penny we made was
to pay the bills and take care of the family. Put clothes on their
back and roof over their head. If the market? That is why have
a different measure for which I judge the
health of the American economy. My measure is Scranton , Duluth Herman town places where I grew up in so many people
I know grew up. I see hard-working
women and men just trying to earn an
honest honest decent living and take care of
their families. They just have a little
bit of confidence to just see around
the corner. They don't have to live
literally from paycheck to paycheck. Most do . But hope for a little
bit of space . Now the American people
are seeing these women and men, the essential
workers workers who stock the shelves
in the Middle East crisis and drivers who drove
the trucks and deliver the food. Farmworkers , nurses who risk their
lives in many cases gave their lives in the
middle of the pandemic to save other people. Essential workers. And when they walked on
the streets and people came out and clapped
hands and watch together to tell them how much
they appreciated that is not enough. They're not asking
for anything. Just asking for a shot. I remind you given a
shot the American people have never ever ever let
their country down. So it's about time we
start to pay essential workers for the fact
that they are essential. Blinders have been taken
off the American people. I think you're ready. Ready to insist that
minimum wage be $15 an hour. They are ready to insist
that people have child care and access to. There ready to admit and
understand the needs of the average American
have. That is why my build
back better plan, in fact my entire campaign is built around
a simple complex. It is time to reward
hard-working American not well. Reward work not well. We should penalize Wolf. It is the opposite now. Right now it is reward
wealth and not work. We need to rebuild an
economy in the wake of COVID-19 and as we do
we have an incredible opportunity to make
long-overdue investments for working families . To make sure that the
wealthy, the very wealthy and the big
corporations finally began to pay their
fair share. Not looking to
punish anybody. Just pay your fair share. It is time to give
hard-working families who built this country
with their skills and their sweat and
their blood like the United
Brotherhood of Carpenters . Give them a leg
up for once. I have a big
ambitious plan that bets on the
American worker. My plan is going
to great millions of good playing jobs. Building products and
technologies that we need now and in
the future. It starts with a
pretty basic idea. When the government
spends taxpayers money we should spend that
money to buy American products , made by American
workers in an American supply
chain to generate American growth and opportunity. My plan would tighten
the rules to make by American reality . During my first
term alone were going to invest
$400 billion of federal money that I have control
over is the president during administration to invest in purchase
products and materials our country need to
monitor and modernize our infrastructure. To replenish critical
stockpiles. To enhance our national
security. I was just going through
the apprentice program with one of your
carpenters. He was showing me how
to read blueprints. And I'm a frustrated
architect. I just love them. My kids years ago bought
me a light board. I have no professional
training. But I like and
I carry around graph paper. Am always making up
the designing homes and landscapes. That is my way out. Some people can
paint, I cannot. He was showing me the
blueprints and how they can change several walls
in particular building to conserve and
save energy. And he pointed out what
you have to learn to be able to read
a blueprint. I pointed out to him
that my fight America plan. He said by the
way, not me, this carpenter said this. He said by the way we
can kill two birds of one stone. We can do two things
at once. He said we can improve
the environment by using less energy to operate
this building and create more jobs. Assemblies send you
a copy of my plan. My by American build
America plan calls for literally
what we started in administration
cannot finish. Retrofitting 4 million
buildings in America that are leaking
millions of gallons of energy now . In the process creating the 4 million jobs for skilled labor. Replacing Windows installation
that works. Making sure that the unit is tight , including retrofitting 2 million homes . All of it done in a prevailing wage
with union labor. Creating hundreds
of thousands of union certified
jobs. That is not hyperbole,
that is a fact, that is how it will happen. Then saving millions of
gallons of oil in the process. And improving our
environment. That is why the IBEW
and a lot of other union support what we're doing. We will put in 500,000
charging stations in our highways. Why? So we can own, own, own , the electric
car market. Estimated creating
1 million new jobs in Michigan and Detroit and the automobile
industry. Look we could
outcompete anybody if we set our mind to it. My infrastructure plan
is going to revitalize American infrastructures
in the future is made in America. The president keeps
talking about he's going to invest in
infrastructure right? Housing how many times
he said he had a plan his info structure
plan that is coming. That he had one in oh 18
other one in 19 and now he is one for 20. Just like his
nonexistent healthcare plan that is coming
next week. He has no plan. When I got started this was not a
partisan issue. Dealing with
infrastructure. Republicans wanted to
build solid infrastructure to make
us first in the world and now we rank 28th. Just like Democrats did. It was totally
nonpartisan. In creating thousands
and thousands and thousands and thousands
of good paying jobs. Were going to invest
over time $2 trillion to build resilient infrastructure, roads,
bridges, ports , right here along this
great great lake. 1.5 million new
affordable housing units. High-speed broadband
for every American household. More important than
ever as we educate our children from home
because there's no plan on how to open
our schools. $100 billion to
rebuild schools. How many schools in
America do you think there are a you cannot
safely drink the water from the water fountain? Were they are worried
about whether or not there is enough
ventilation in the school. Whether there is
leaking energy or storehouse hazardous
materials in the wall. It is ridiculous. We should be spending
the money to improve the schools for the safety
of our children and our teachers. As I said, retrofitting
4 million holdings and whether raising
2 million homes. The way we do that
is with tax credits that we give
them again. All done by certified
union labor . I will fight for workers
and unions at every step working all federal
infrastructure project to one pay prevailing
wage to prioritize project labor agreements
and collective bargaining is in place
before the project starts. Employee workers from
registered apprenticeships. I will not water them
down like Trump tried to do. Past the proactive clack
cracked and employers who try to block
or break unions. I will do it without
raising anyone's taxes. If you make less than
$400,000 a year. I give you my word that
you have nothing to worry about if you make
less than 400,000 year. If you make more, you're
going to start paying your fair share. Nobody who makes less
than 40,000 will pay a single penny more in
taxes under administration. Tens of millions of
middle class families will get tax cuts when
they need it most. While you're raising
your children and try to get affordable
healthcare or buying your first home or
saving for retirement. Almost directly after
President Trump passes his tax bill in 2017
almost $2 trillion increase in the deficit. He went down to Mira
Largo and he said to his guests there this is a
quote on record, you just got a lot
Richard."". . Mike you just got
a lot richer. What about the person
making 5060 or hundred 20 ? How much did you get how
much richer did you get? Maybe the only time he is told the plain
truth in his entire presidency . In 2018 the year after
that tax cut passed 91 corporations in the
Fortune 500 paid no income tax. Zero tax, zero. Making billions
of dollars. Paying zero tax. I guess you guys got
all of your taxes limited to rate? He said it was going
to be the lowest , going to lower the
cost of prescription drugs. Guess what. Instead big Pharma cut
billions of dollars in tax cuts set in their
manufacture those drugs overseas and then unconscionably
raise them so they beetroot cheaper for
them to produce. Unconscionably raise the
prices to ordinary Americans. How many of you people
knew your mothers, fathers, uncles, aunts,
friends who had to choose between getting
a prescription, not a joke, and putting dinner
on the table. Now he says he's going
to cut drug prices. Like he's going to have
a healthcare plan. All he is done , calling on the
drug prices cut. All he is done is sent to the HHS,
Health and Human Services, he said
study the issue . I have a clear plan. I guarantee I can lower prices in
America for drugs by allowing Medicare
to negotiate the prices full stop
which he said he would do. The House and Senate
were ready to do it and he said he would veto
it if you got it. If you want to
participate in the Medicare program you have to negotiate
with Medicare. For the price
of that drug. To significantly
lower prices. And for any new
specialty drugs that do not have competition , I'm sending a review
Board to recommend a reasonable price based
on the boards evaluation. And that price will not
be able to be increased on the cost of medical
inflation. Unless they can prove
that they've gone and done some more research
and changed the nature of the drug. And now astonishingly
and with my staff told me this, I know both the
Senators do this, but when they told me this
I said he cannot be proposing this. He is now proposing, in
this budget, another multi-billion dollar cut
tax cut for the very wealthy millionaires
and billionaires. Here's what he
wants to do. He wants to lower the
capital gains tax down to 15% . To 15%. Everyone of you including the reporters
in this room unless you make a lot
more than I think you were, everyone of you is
going to be paying at a higher tax rate than
someone making $1 billion off their investment. You're going to pay
a higher tax rate . Because they make their money by investing not
by the sweat of their brow. Another tax cut worth
billions of dollars. And who , whose high do you
think that's going to come out of. What is to come from? The deficit is
already bonkers. When you think it's
going to Kamala? Come out of you and the
programs and the things that help the
American people . Like I said it's about
time we start rewarding work and not well. I'm not looking to
punish anyone. But, dammit, it is about
time that the super wealthy and corporate America
start paying their fair share. That is all. Just pay their
fair share. So hard-working families
can certainly break on elderly care, child
care, by the first home, the cost of education
beyond high school, being able to get
started in life. By the way while all
this is going on Donald Trump is trying to rip
away your healthcare. Saying he has a new
healthcare program and protect conditions. He is in the Supreme
Court saying get rid of pre-existing conditions. They should be able to
stand in the way of you getting insurance
because it helps insurance companies. Also gimmick he
has a new one. He is going to and the
payroll tax that you pay on Social Security. Yet the actuary at the
Social Security says if that were to occur,
Social Security will be bankrupt by the
middle of 2023 . You may get a few more
bucks on your paycheck and then go home and
tell your mom and dad Social Security is about
to come to an end. They never liked Social
Security and Medicare to begin with. So look we cannot let
this happen . This Social Security
will run dry by 2023. Were so much better
than this. This is the United
States of America. We have never ever ever
ever been unable to do something when we've done
it together. Never. So it is time to stand up , Democrats and
Republicans. I said last night. My colleagues know
Democrats get mad this. I'm running as
a Democrat. But I'm going to be
president of the United States not president of
the Democratic Party. It's time to take the
country back folks. And it's going
to start here. Today with Bodie in
Minnesota. So God bless you'll and may God protect
our troops. Thank you thank

ndure this pandemic have make over n$ billion do PRON hear what ni just say in the middle of a npandemic PRON be leave to wonder be the consequence who nis look out for the ordinary folk that be be the entire nstory of donald trump presidency now in the midst of this nunprecedente national crisis trump have given nup on even pretend to do PRON job almost laws nlive lose in the last six month and experts ntell PRON now the same study that PRON relied non the administration rely on to predict nwhat come next that PRON will lose nanother life between now and njanuary the united states has nlost another new covid case per day per day another average ndeaths a day just across the border nfigure really speak a stone throw nindicate that one day earlier this month nthe united states the united states have a nthousand death of covid in canada have zero just three day ago ni believe PRON be america have ndeaths canada have nine nine so many life lost nunnecessarily because the president be only worry about nthe stock market in PRON reelection PRON refuse to do what nyou be do right here in this program social distance wear nmasks sanitize you re protect your napprentice and PRON be not protect america PRON be estimate by the nscientist that if PRON just wear masks nnationally PRON would save life between nnow and january let PRON say that again if PRON would just wear nmask nationally PRON would save lives nbetween now and january accord to the nsame study PRON be estimate by ngreat medical school the columbia medical nschool that if the president have just nstarte one week earlier in march then PRON do we nwould have more people sit at the ndinner table tonight be able to put your narm around grampa or grandma tonight again in PRON own word record by bob nwoodward the president know back in february that this was nan extremely dangerous communicable disease think about PRON how many people across nthe iron range how many empty chairs naround the dinner table because of his nnegligence and selfishness how many lie say and live lost imagine if PRON just at the state of the nunion that year speak up and say PRON have a nproblem and PRON can handle PRON and here s nwhat PRON have to do i can not think nof any president who be ever active in nmy view so selfishly on PRON own reelection instead of his nsworn obligation to protect and defend nthe american people as i say last night in PRON hometown i view this campaign nis between scranton and part of park avenue all trump see from park navenue be wall street that be why the only nmetric of the american press for PRON be the nvalue of the dow jones like a lot of PRON but na lot of PRON life with guy like donald ntrump look down on PRON look down the people nwho make a living with PRON hand people who take care nof PRON kid people who cleaner nstreet maybe what bother me nmost be the way PRON talk about to make sources nconfirme by many outlet where PRON be talk about nthe man and woman who join the military and ngave full measure to PRON country nas sucker and loser unless PRON think PRON is nmade up remember how PRON talk about jon mccain a political opponent nbut a close friend when i be at nhis eulogy jon mccain be no sucker or loser PRON be a hero PRON son who volunteer nto spend to year in a rack and win the nbronze star PRON be a loser nor sucker PRON be a proud patriot these be the guy who nis think PRON be well than me nbetter than PRON because PRON had na lot of money guy who inherit neverythe under god and still nmanage to squander i have to admit which i nguess

97,ml5-xY3P8L4,biden,2020-09-20T18:53:46Z,Joe Biden Speech on The Supreme Court & Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg LIVE,speech,">> Good afternoon. Welcome to the nations
constitution center. I had the great
privilege of being a guest leader of this
outfit for a year. It is an appropriate
place to make a speech that
I am about to make. I attended mass
earlier today and prayed for justice Ruth
Bader Ginsburg and her family. The nation lost
to heroin, and icon in a mother. , grandmother and
a matriarch. We know how hard that is to watch a piece
of your soul to absorb the cruelty
and pain of the dreadful disease cancer. I spoke to her daughter
and granddaughter last night expressing my whole family's
sorrow, particularly my
granddaughters. One of whom
was a student of Ruth Bader
Ginsburg's daughter at Columbia. They made clear to me , the daughter and
granddaughter, that until the very end Justice Ginsburg displayed the character and courage
we would expect of her. She said they held her
hands and give them strength and purpose
to carry on. It has been noted that
she passed away on Rosh Hashanah. By tradition the person that dies
during the Jewish new year is considered a soul of great righteousness. That was Ruth Bader
Ginsburg, a righteous soul. It was my great honor when I was in the
Senate and chairman of the judiciary committee
to preside over her confirmation hearings
and strongly support her accession
to the Supreme Court bench. Justice Ginsburg achieved a standing
few justices have or ever will. She became a presence
in the lives of so many Americans and part of our culture. I agree with what
others have said, that she did as much to advance the
constitutional rights, opportunities and
justice for women as Justice Marshall did
for African-Americans. Yes, there was humor and
mentions of the notorious RPG and her impressive
exercise routines but there was so much more. She used an overused word,
a trailblazer, role model, a source of hope in a powerful voice
for justice. She was proof that
courage, conviction and moral clarity can change not only the
law, can change our culture, can change the
world and I believe in the days, months
and years ahead she will continue to
inspire millions of Americans all across
this country. And together we can and we will continue to
be a voice for justice in her name. Her granddaughter
said yesterday , and said publicly, that her dying
words were "" my most fervent wish is that I not
be replaced until a new president
is installed."" As a nation we should heed her
final call to us. Not as a personal
service to her but as a service
to the country, our country at
a crossroads. There is so much
at stake. Right to healthcare. Clean air. Clean water. The environment, equal
pay for equal work, the rights for voters,
immigrants, workers, women. And right now our
country faces a choice. A choice about whether
we will come back from the brink. That is what I would
like to talk to about for a few minutes today. Within an hour of news
of her passing, Senate majority leader
Mitch McConnell said President Trump's
nominee to replace Justice Ginsburg will receive a vote
in the Senate. Within an hour
of her passing. The exact opposite
from what he said when President Obama
made a nomination . in 2016. At that time majority McConnell made up a
rule based on the fiction that I somehow
believe there should be no nomination to the court in
an election year. It is ridiculous. The only rule I have
ever followed related to the Supreme Court
nomination was the Constitution's
obligation for senators to provide their
advice and consent to a presidents
judicial nominee. But he created
a new rule. McConnell world. Absolutely no hearing, no vote for nominee
in the election year. Period. No caveats. Many but Republican
senators agree with them including then chairman of the
judiciary committee. Including the current chairman of the
judiciary committee is Lindsey Graham of
South Carolina. With the time said and I will quote
verbatim. Here's what he said, ""I
want you to use my words against me if there is a
Republican president in 2016 and the
vacancy occurs in the last year of the
first term, you can say Lindsay Graham said let's let the next
president, whoever it might be, make
the nomination ."" ""And you can use
my words against me and you be absolutely
right. "" End of quote. That's what Republicans
said when Justice Scalia passed away about
nine months before election
day that year. Now having lost Justice Ginsburg less
than seven weeks before an election this year. After Americans have
already begun to cast their vote. It is estimated that up to 40%
of Americans will have voted
by October 1. At least 30%. Tens of millions. And you can't
unring the bell. Having made this their
standard and to serve their interest they
cannot just, four years later, change course
when it doesn't serve their ends . Look, I am not
being naïve. I'm not speaking
to President Trump who will do whatever
he wants. I'm not speaking
to Mitch McConnell it will do what he
wants and he does. I am speaking to those
Republicans out there, Senate Republicans, who know deep down what
is right for the country and consistent with
the Constitution as I stand here in the
Constitution Center. Not just what is
best for the party. I am speaking for
millions of Americans out there who already
have voted and continue to vote in many more
will have voted by the time this
process is finished. Millions of Americans
were voting because they know their
healthcare hangs in the balance. In the middle
of the worst global health crisis
in living memory , Donald Trump is before
the Supreme Court trying to strip healthcare
coverage away from tens of millions
of families. To strip away the peace
of mind of more than 100 million Americans
with pre-existing conditions. If he succeeds, insurers can once
again discriminate or drop coverage
completely for people living with pre-existing
conditions like asthma, diabetes,
cancer and so many other problems. And perhaps , most cruelly of all,
if Donald Trump has his way complications from
COVID-19 which are well beyond what they should
be, it's estimated that 200 million people will have died probably by the time I finish
this talk. The complications
of COVID-19 like lung scarring
and heart damage could become the next deniable
pre-existing condition for over 6 million Americans who have
already contracted the disease. Millions of Americans are also voting because they don't want nearly
1/2 a century of legal precedent to overturn
and lose the right to choose. Millions of Americans are at risk of losing
their right to vote. Millions of Dreamers
are at risk for being expelled from the only
country they have ever known. Millions of workers,
union workers, are at risk of losing
the right to collectively bargain. Millions of Americans who are demanding that their voices
be heard and equal justice to guarantee for
all, not just some. They know we all know
what should happen now. Voters in this country
should be heard. As I said, voting has already
begun. By the time we get to the middle of
October there will be millions and millions
and millions who have already voted. In just a few weeks all
boats of this nation will be heard. They are the ones with the Constitution
vision can decide who has
the power to make this appointment. This appointment is
not about the past. It is about the future. and the Pizzo people of this nation. And the people of this
nation are choosing this right now as the boat. To Jim this to the
Senate is an exercise in raw political power. I do not believe the
people of this nation will stand for it. President Trump has
already made it clear this is about power. Pure and simple power. Whether the voters
should make it clear on this issue and so many others , the power in this
nation resides with them the American people,
the voters. Even if President Trump
wants to put forward a name now, the Senate
should not act until after the American
people select their next president. The next Congress,
their next Senate. If Donald Trump wins
the election than the Senate should move on
his selection and way the nominee he
chooses fairly. If I win this election,
President Trump 's nominee should be
withdrawn and as the new president I should be
the one nominates Justice Ginsburg's
successor. And nominees should get a fair hearing
in the Senate before confirmation
hearing -- a confirmation vote
I should say after a confirmation hearing. We are in the middle
of a pandemic. Like I said, as we speak
we are probably passing 200,000 deaths
lost to this virus. Tens of millions of
Americans are unemployed. Healthcare in this
country hangs in the balance before the court. And now in a raw
political move this President and the
Republican leader have decided to jam a lifetime
appointment to the Supreme Court
through the United States Senate. It's the last thing we
need at this moment. As I have said, voters have already
begun casting their votes. In the millions . In just a few weeks we
are going to know who the voters of this
nation have chosen as the next president. The United States
Constitution was designed to give voters
one chance. When chance to have
their voice heard and who serves in the court. And by the way, there is
no court session between now and the end of
this election. That moment is now
for the voters to get a chance
to be heard. And their voice
should be heard. And I believe voters are going to
make it clear they will not stand for this
abuse of power. This constitutional abuse . There is no discussion
about what happens if the Senate confirms on
the eve of election or lame duck after Donald
Trump loses. The successor to Justice Ginsburg,
what happens? But that discussion
assumes that we lose this
effort to protect -- prevent the grave
wrong that Trump and McConnell are
pursuing here. I'm not going to assume
failure at this point. I believe the voice of
the American people should be heard
and will be hurt. This vote, despite,
this nomination will not be over until
the Senate votes , if it does vote. Winning that vote, if
it happens, is everything. Action and reaction , anger and more anger. Sorrow and frustration
at the way things are in this
country now politically. That is the cycle that Republican senators
will continue to perpetuate if they go
down this dangerous path that they have
put us on. We need to de-escalate. Not escalate. That's why I appeal
to those few Senate Republicans. The handful that really
will decide what happens. Please follow
your conscience , do not vote to confirm
anyone nominated under the circumstances
President Trump and Senator McConnell
have created. Don't go there. Uphold your
constitutional duty. Your conscience. Let the people speak. Cool the flames that
have been engulfing our country. We can't keep rewriting
history, scribbling norms, ignoring our cherished
system of checks and balances. That includes this
whole business of leasing a list of potential
nominees that I would put forward and now saying after
Ruth Bader Ginsburg gin up emotions
and anger. There's no reason why residential canon other
than Donald Trump has ever done
such a thing. Putting out a list like
that could influence that person's
decision-making as a Judge. Second, anyone putting
a list out like that under these circumstances will be subject to
unrelenting political attacks because any
nominee I would select would not get a hearing
until 2021 at the earliest. She would endure those attacks for
months on end without being able to defend
herself. Thirdly and finally,
perhaps most importantly, if I win I will make my choice
for the Supreme Court not based on a partisan
election campaign but on what prior
presidents have done, Republican and
Democrats, and I have served with many of them. Only after consulting
Democrats and Republicans in the
United States Senate and seeking their
advice and asking for the consent. It says advice and
consent of the Senate. The president is the
person that gets to name someone, proposed. The Senate disposes. As everyone knows, I made it first clear
my first choice of the Supreme Court will make history as
the first African American woman justice. I will consult with
senators on both parties. As well as the legal
and civil leaders in our country. In the end, the choice
will be mine and mine alone but I will consult . It will be the product of a process that
restores our finest traditions. Not the extension
of one that has torn this country apart
the last years. Let me conclude
with this. As I said in
this campaign we are in the battle
of the soul for this country. We face historic crises . Once in a generation
pandemic , a devastating economic
recession, the rise of white
supremacy that the FBI directors oneness against unseen
since the 60s and a reckoning on race that
is long overdue. A challenging climate,
a changing climate that is ravaging our
nation and the world as we speak. The Supreme Court
decisions will touch every part
of these crises. Every part of our lives
and our future. The last thing we
need is to add a constitutional crisis that plunges us deeper
into the abyss, deeper into the darkness. If we go down this path I predict it will cause
irreversible damage . The infection this
president has unleashed on our democracy
can be fatal. Enough. Enough. Enough. We must come together as a nation. Democrats, Republicans,
independents, liberals, conservatives. Everybody. I'm not saying we have
to agree and everything but we have to reason our way to what ails us and citizens , voters, public
servants. That is the guide book
called the Constitution. We have to act
in good faith and mutual goodwill in the spirit of conciliation not
confrontation. This nation will
continue to be inspired by Ruth Bader Ginsburg we should not only be
inspired by her but we should be guided by her. By her willingness to
listen to those with whom she disagreed, to
respect other points of view. Famously Justice Ginsburg got
along well with some of the most conservative
justices on the court. She did it without
compromising her principles, clouding
her moral clarity or losing her
core principles. If she can do this, so can we. How we talk to one
another it matters. How we treat on
another matters. Respecting others,
matters. Justice Ginsburg proved it's important
to have a spine of steel. But also important to have an open hand,
not a clenched fist. to those with whom
we disagree. This nation needs
to come together. I have said it many
times in this election. We are the united
states of America. There's nothing we
cannot overcome. There's nothing we
cannot do we do it together. Donald Trump seems
to want us to divide this nation between red
states and blue states. Representing those
states that Bo -- vote for him and
those that don't. I do not. I cannot. I will not. Be that President. Will be a president
for the whole country. But those who
vote for me and those who
vote against me. We need to rise
to this moment. For the sake
of the country we love so dearly , indeed boards
very soul. May God bless the
United States of America. May God bless
our troops. May God bless Ruth Bader Ginsburg.

nmillion of americans out there who already nhave vote and continue to vote in many more nwill have vote by the time this nprocess be finish million of americans nwere voting because PRON know their nhealthcare hang in the balance in the middle nof the bad global health crisis nin live memory donald trump be before nthe supreme court try to strip healthcare ncoverage away from ten of millions nof family to strip away the peace nof mind of more than million americans nwith pre existing condition if PRON succeed insurer can once nagain discriminate or drop coverage ncompletely for people live with pre existing ncondition like asthma diabetes ncancer and so many other problem and perhaps most cruelly of all nif donald trump have PRON way complication from ncovid which be well beyond what PRON should nbe it estimate that million people will have die probably by the time i finish nthis talk the complications nof covid like lung scarring nand heart damage could become the next deniable npre exist condition for over million americans who have nalready contract the disease million of americans be also vote because PRON don t want nearly n a century of legal precedent to overturn nand lose the right to choose million of americans be at risk of losing ntheir right to vote million of dreamers nare at risk for be expel from the only ncountry PRON have ever know million of workers nunion worker be at risk of losing nthe right to collectively bargain million of americans who be demand that PRON voices nbe hear and equal justice to guarantee for nall not just some PRON know PRON all know nwhat should happen now voter in this country nshould be hear as i say voting have already nbegun by the time PRON get to the middle of noctober there will be million and millions nand million who have already vote in just a few week all nboat of this nation will be hear PRON be the one with the constitution nvision can decide who has nthe power to make this appointment this appointment is nnot about the past PRON be about the future and the pizzo people of this nation and the people of this nnation be choose this right now as the boat to jim this to the nsenate be an exercise in raw political power i do not believe the npeople of this nation will stand for PRON president trump has nalready make PRON clear this be about power pure and simple power whether the voters nshould make PRON clear on this issue and so many other the power in this nnation reside with PRON the american people nthe voter even if president trump nwant to put forward a name now the senate nshould not act until after the american npeople select PRON next president the next congress ntheir next senate if donald trump wins nthe election than the senate should move on nhis selection and way the nominee he nchoose fairly if i win this election npresident trump nominee should be nwithdrawn and as the new president i should be nthe one nominate justice ginsburg s nsuccessor and nominee should get a fair hearing nin the senate before confirmation nheare a confirmation vote ni should say after a confirmation hearing PRON be in the middle nof a pandemic like i say as PRON speak nwe be probably pass deaths nlost to this virus ten of million of namerican be unemployed healthcare in this ncountry hang in the balance before the court and now in a raw npolitical move this president and the nrepublican leader have decide to jam a lifetime nappointment to the supreme court nthrough the united states senate it be the last thing we nneed at this moment as i have say voter have already nbegun cast PRON vote in the million in just a few week we nare go to know who the voter of this nnation have choose as the next president the united states nconstitution be design to give voters none chance when chance to have ntheir voice hear and who serve in the court and by the way there is nno court session between now and the end of nthis election that moment be now nfor the voter to get a chance nto be hear and PRON voice nshould be hear and i believe voter be go to nmake PRON clear PRON will not stand for this nabuse of power this constitutional abuse there be no discussion nabout what happen if the senate confirm on nthe eve of election or lame duck after donald ntrump lose the successor to justice ginsburg nwhat happen but that discussion nassume that PRON lose this neffort to protect prevent the grave nwrong that trump and mcconnell are npursue here i m not go to assume nfailure at this point i believe the voice of nthe american people should be heard nand will be hurt this vote despite nthis nomination will not be over until nthe senate vote if PRON do vote win that vote if nit happen be everything action and reaction anger and more anger sorrow and frustration nat the way thing be in this ncountry now politically that be the cycle that republican senators nwill continue to perpetuate if PRON go ndown this dangerous path that PRON have nput PRON on PRON need to de escalate not escalate that be why i appeal nto those few senate republicans the handful that really nwill decide what happen please follow nyour conscience do not vote to confirm nanyone nominate under the circumstances npresident trump and senator mcconnell nhave create don t go there uphold your nconstitutional duty PRON conscience let the people speak cool the flame that nhave be engulf PRON country PRON can t keep rewriting nhistory scribble norm ignore PRON cherished nsystem of check and balance that include this nwhole business of lease a list of potential nnominee that i would put forward and now say after nruth bader ginsburg gin up emotions nand anger there be no reason why residential canon other nthan donald trump have ever done nsuch a thing put out a list like nthat could influence that person s ndecision make as a judge second anyone putting na list out like that under these circumstance will be subject to nunrelente political attack because any nnominee i would select would not get a hearing nuntil at the early PRON would endure those attack for nmonth on end without be able to defend nherself thirdly and finally nperhap most importantly if i win i will make PRON choice nfor the supreme court not base on a partisan nelection campaign but on what prior npresident have do republican and ndemocrats and i have serve with many of PRON only after consulting ndemocrat and republicans in the nunited state senate and seek their nadvice and ask for the consent PRON say advice and nconsent of the senate the president be the nperson that get to name someone propose the senate dispose as everyone know i make PRON first clear nmy first choice of the supreme court will make history as nthe first african american woman justice i will consult with nsenator on both party as well as the legal nand civil leader in PRON country in the end the choice nwill be mine and PRON alone but i will consult PRON will be the product of a process that nrestore PRON fine tradition not the extension nof one that have tear this country apart nthe last year let PRON conclude nwith this as i say in nthis campaign PRON be in the battle nof the soul for this country PRON face historic crisis once in a generation npandemic a devastating economic nrecession the rise of white nsupremacy that the fbi director oneness against unseen nsince the and a reckoning on race that nis long overdue a challenging climate na change climate that be ravage our nnation and the world as PRON speak the supreme court ndecisions will touch every part nof these crisis every part of PRON lives nand PRON future the last thing we nneed be to add a constitutional crisis that plunge PRON deeper ninto the abyss deep into the darkness if PRON go down this path i predict PRON will cause nirreversible damage the infection this npresident have unleash on PRON democracy ncan be fatal enough enough enough PRON must come together as a nation democrats republicans nindependents liberal conservative everybody i m not say PRON have nto agree and everything but PRON have to reason PRON way to what ail PRON and citizen voter public nservant that be the guide book ncalle the constitution PRON have to act nin good faith and mutual goodwill in the spirit of conciliation not nconfrontation this nation will ncontinue to be inspire by ruth bader ginsburg PRON should not only be ninspire by PRON but PRON should be guide by PRON by PRON willingness to nlisten to those with whom PRON disagree to nrespect other point of view famously justice ginsburg got nalong well with some of the most conservative njustice on the court PRON do PRON without ncompromise PRON principle clouding nher moral clarity or lose her ncore principle if PRON can do this so can PRON how PRON talk to one nanother PRON matter how PRON treat on nanother matter respect others nmatters justice ginsburg prove it important nto have a spine of steel but also important to have an open hand nnot a clenched fist to those with whom nwe disagree this nation needs nto come together i have say PRON many ntime in this election PRON be the united nstates of america there nothing we ncannot overcome there nothing we ncannot do PRON do PRON together donald trump seems nto want PRON to divide this nation between red nstate and blue state represent those nstate that bo vote for PRON and nthose that don t i do not i can not i will not be that president will be a president nfor the whole country but those who nvote for PRON and those who nvote against PRON PRON need to rise nto this moment for the sake nof the country PRON love so dearly indeed boards nvery soul may god bless the nunited state of america may god bless nour troop may god bless ruth bader ginsburg thank so much
98,b-1S_pkGQw4,biden,2020-09-21T20:07:16Z,Live: Biden speaks in Wisconsin,speech,F THE DAY BECAUSE OF A CORONAVIRUS. TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND DEATHS. ALL ACROSS THIS NATION. THE NAMES THE NAMES THERE ARE EMPTY CHAIRS IN DINING ROOM TABLES AND KITCHEN TABLES. THE WEEKS AND MONTHS AGO WERE FILLED WITH A LOT OF ONE ON MOM AND DAD OR BROTHER OR SISTER. IN MANY CASES THE PAIN WAS MADE A LOT WORSE BECAUSE- AND I'VE HAD PEOPLE TELL ME THIS AND CLOSE FAMILY CLOSE FRIENDS OF THE FAMILY TELL ME. BECAUSE THEY ARE UNABLE TO VISIT THEIR ELDERLY PARENT OR GRANDPARENT NURSING HOME JUST BEFORE THE PASSED AWAY. DON'T KNOW HOW MANY STORIES I'VE HEARD. ABOUT A FROM THE NURSES SAY THEY HELD UP A CELLPHONE. TO THE PATIENT ON A VENTILATOR IN THE BED ABOUT THE PAST MISDEMEANOR. AND THAT'S ALL THEY CAN SPEAK TO. SO THE FACT THAT PEOPLE WEREN'T ABLE TO HOLD FUNERAL SERVICES FOR FAMILY AND FRIENDS CAN PLAY TOGETHER REMEMBER THE LOVED ONES THEY LOST. PLACE THEM AS A PLACE IN THE HANDS OF GOD. AND SO MANY OF THE RITUALS WE'VE COME TO HELP US COPE WITH PAIN AND LOSS. TRUMP WAS HONORED THE LIVES OF THOSE WE LOVE. TROUBLES COME TO CLOSURE- JUST AREN'T AVAILABLE THE NUMBERS PANDEMIC. WHAT WORRIES ME NOW. IS WE'VE BEEN LIVING WITH THIS PANDEMIC FOR SO LONG. I WERE RISKING BECOMING NON TO THE TOLL IS TAKEN ON US AND OUR COUNTRY IN COMMUNITIES LIKE THIS. WE CAN'T LET THAT HAPPEN. YOU CAN'T LOSE THE ABILITY TO FEEL THE SORROW ON THE LOSS IN THE ANGER FOR SO MANY LIVES LOST. WE CAN'T LET THE NUMBERS BECOME STATISTICS OF BACKGROUND NOISE. JUST A BLOWER. AND SHE ON THE NIGHTLY NEWS. TWO HUNDRED MOMS DADS SONS DAUGHTERS GRANDPARENTS UNCLES AUNTS FRIENDS CO WORKERS. WHO NO LONGER WITH US AND SO MANY AND DIDN'T HAVE TO LOSE THEIR LIVES INSPIRES. CALLED TRACKING ONLY THE PRESIDENT ACTED SOONER. BACK IN MAY COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY RELEASED A STUDY THAT SAID THAT IF THE PRESIDENT ACTED JUST ONE WEEK SHOWED. WE WILL SAVE THIRTY SIX THOUSAND LIFE. TODAY LEADING MODEL BEING USED TO TRACK THE VIRUS ONE WAS THE WHITE HOUSE AND MANY OTHERS RELY ON THAT MODEL SAYS BETWEEN NOW AND THE END OF THIS YEAR. WHILE WE'RE WAITING FOR VACCINE. BETWEEN NOW AND THE END OF THE YEAR WE'RE GONNA LOSE UP TO TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND ADDITIONAL LIVES IT RANGE FROM A HUNDRED SEVENTY EIGHT THOUSAND. TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND. THE POINTS OUT AS WELL THAT IF WE ACT. BY DOING WHAT YOU'RE DOING HERE WISCONSIN WEARING MASK MAKING MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS TO MEET THIS WEEK IN SAY. BECAUSE SAY. OVER A HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS LIVES. SO I HOPE TO GOD WILL NOT LEARN THE SAME LESSON. MAKE CAPITOLINUS SAME BAD LESSON WE LEARNED FIRST FIVE. DONALD TRUMP FLIES IN THE CONFERENCE IN THE PAST SIX MONTHS AND SHE ONE OF THE GREATEST LOSSES OF AMERICAN LIFE AND HISTORY. IN HISTORY. BUT SADLY. IT'S NOT OVER. AS AWFUL AS THE FAST UNDER EIGHTY DAYS OF BED THE NEXT NINETY DAYS COULD BE TWICE AS BAD. AS FAR AS THE ABOUT. WE COULD BE LOOKING AT GOES I SAID BETWEEN 1-007-200-1000 LIVES LOST IN ALL THE PRESIDENT DOZENS DELIVERED TO CHANGE THE SUBJECT. WHICH IS ESPECIALLY INFURIATING ONCE AGAIN. WE'RE BEING TOLD THAT. YOU CAN SAVE LIVES THIS TIME AS MANY AS EIGHT HUNDRED TEN THOUSAND LIVES WE JUST TAKE A SIMPLE STEPS CHIEF AMONG THE MORE MASS. IT'S STILL THE PRESERVATION IS. IN FACT WE JUST WATCHED IN HOLDING INDOOR RALLY WITH THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE. MANY OF WHOM WERE WEARING MASKS DESPITE THE CLEAR EVIDENCE. THAT THE PRETTY EVERYONE OF THOSE PEOPLE'S LIVES AT RISK. PRESIDENT NEW OF THESE DANGERS BACK IN FEBRUARY. ANY HIDDEN FROM THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. EXACTLY YEARS ON VOICE RECORDER BY BOB WOULD RIGIDITY WITH. SAYING THAT HE UNDERSTOOD HOW BAD IT WAS WE HEAR PRIVATELY SAYING THIS IS A DEADLY VIRUS FAR MORE DEADLY THAN ANY FLU. BUT THAT'S NOT WHAT HE WAS SAYING HE WAS PUBLICLY. PUBLICLY HE TOLD US THAT IT WAS JUST LIKE THE FLU. AND IT WOULD DISAPPEAR. THE WARM WEATHER LIKE AMERICA. IT WAS ALL A LIE. HE KNEW IT. WHAT WHAT'S THE EXPLANATION HE SAID HE DIDN'T WANT TO SEE THE AMERICAN PEOPLE PANIC YOU WANT TO PANIC. VIRUSES TOO BIG FOR HIM. ALL HIS LIFE DONALD TRUMP HAS BEEN BAILED OUT VERY PROBLEM WE FACED WITH THIS CRISIS REAL CRISIS TO CRISIS REQUIRED SURE IS PRESIDENTIAL LEADERSHIP. HE JUST ONE UP TO. HEATHROW A FAILED ACT YOU PANIC. AND AMERICANS PAID THE WORST PRICE OF ANY NATION IN THE WORLD. STILL IT'S FOR ANOTHER STANLEY DONALD TRUMP WAS SAYING MAJORITY BACK PEOPLE DON'T PANIC. YOU DON'T PANIC. I UNDERSTAND WHAT HE WAS SAYING BECAUSE A CRYSTALLIZES WHOLE WORLDVIEW. DONALD TRUMP SAID HE DIDN'T CREATE IT YOU WANT TO CREATE A PANIC. HE WASN'T JUST TALKING ABOUT HEALTH PLANNING. IS FOCUSED ON THE STOCK MARKET. TRUMP WAS WORRIED THAT HE TOLD THE PUBLIC THE TRUTH- BE A PANIC ON THE FINANCIAL MARKETS. NETWORKERS CHANCES BE REELECTED. I TELL DONALD TRUMP VIEWS THE WORLD. HE SEES THE WORLD FROM PARK AVENUE. I SEE FROM MY GREW UP IN A TIME LIKE THIS SCRANTON PENNSYLVANIA. HARDSCRABBLE HARDWORKING TOWN JUST LIKE THIS AND SO MANY MORE ACROSS WISCONSIN. WHEN I LOOK AT THE WORLD FROM. THE WORLD FROM PARK AVENUE BEIJING LEGACY'S WALL STREET. YOU THINK WALL STREET BUILT THIS COUNTRY. WHEN WE TELL YOU. YOU THINK THAT DONALD TRUMP HAS CHILDREN'S. THAT HANDY NOW A HALTER ONE FOUR FIVE DOLLAR TAX GIVEAWAY. PRIMARILY FOR LARGE CORPORATIONS AND WEALTHY QUALIFIERS IS AN ECONOMIC PLAN. YOU THINK LIKE TRUMP THAT FIFTEEN DOLLARS AN HOUR IS TOO MUCH FOR AMERICA'S ESSENTIAL WORKERS. ELIMINATE OVERTIME PAY FOR MILLIONS OF AMERICAN WORKERS. WE TRY TO TAKE AWAY HEALTH CARE. TWENTY MILLION AMERICANS IN THE MIDDLE OF THIS PANDEMIC YOU SEE COURT TODAY TRYING TO GET THAT DONE. YOU TRY TO TAKE AWAY PROTECTIONS FOR PRE EXISTING CONDITIONS FOR A HUNDRED THIRTY MILLION AMERICANS. WE PROPOSE A PLAN THAT. IN ORDER TO MAKE IT LOOK GOOD. YOU'RE GONNA GET A LITTLE BUMP IN YOUR PAYCHECK TO TAKE UP WITH HOLDING FOR SO SECURITY. BUT GUESS WHAT. THE EXPERTS- SECURITY SAYS IF HE DOES THAT SOCIAL SECURITY WILL BE BANKRUPT. BY THE MIDDLE OF TWENTY TWENTY THREE. YOU MIGHT GET THAT. OUT OF YOUR PAYCHECK WILL MORE IN YOUR PAYCHECK GUESS WHAT COMMENT TELL YOUR MOM AND DAD. SAY GOODBYE TO SO SECURITY WORK FOR THEIR WHOLE LIVES. THANK THREE TOUGH WITH CHINA. IS A TRADE DEAL THAT OPENS THE DOOR TO BIG BANKS TO MAKE MONEY IN CHINA. I SPACEY WHILE WE GOT OUT OF A LOT OF. GERRY FARMERS FARMERS IN MANUFACTURING ONE UNDER. BUT GUESS WHAT. WE STARTED TO TRADE WARS ARE LEADS THE SURGEON FORM BANKER AMERICA THROWS AMERICAN MANUFACTURING INTO IT. INTO RECESSION BUT YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENED. I DON'T KNOW THIS IS FOR FINISHED I WAS IT'S ABOUT. AMERICA'S BANK CITIBANK EVER GOT OPEN. HE BEIJING. THEY WERE ABLE TO BEFORE. DESCRIBING THE DEAL LOWER PRESCRIPTION DRUG PRICES. HE PROBABLY HAD TO DEAL. WE WANT THE PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES BEFORE THEY LOWER THE PRICES TO DO SOMETHING THAT THEY FELT WAS UNETHICAL. YES IN THE SENATE OUT HUNDRED DOLLAR CHECK WITH HIS NAME ON IT. TWO SOCIAL SECURITY RESEARCH TO IT TO ADD TO THE ELDERLY. SAYING THAT THAT'S THE DOWN PAYMENT WE SAID WE'RE NOT GONNA DO THAT. IT WAS THEY WERE GONNA DO WHAT'S THE DEAL FELL APART. AND NOW SOME THIRTY MILLION AMERICANS ARE ON A PLANET. I THINK THE WAY TO GET AMERICAN ECONOMY BACK ON TRACK IF YOU GIVE ANOTHER GIGANTIC MULTI MILLION DOLLAR TAX CUTS TO THE VERY WEALTHY. REGIONS ARE DOING. THE TAX RATE ALL THE FAILURE. IT'S GOING TO BE HIGHER THE BILLIONAIRE SHOULD MAKE THE MONEY ON INVESTMENTS IS NOT EXAGGERATION HE WANTS TO LOWER AGAIN THE THIRTY BILLION DOLLARS IN THE TREASURY. LOWER THE CAPITAL GAINS TAX 250% SO SOMEONE WHO MAKES THE MONEY IS OFF THE MARKET. IS PAYING THE 50% RATE. REPENT OF THE TWENTY FOUR TWENTY SIX TWENTY EIGHT TWENTY NINE NEW TAX BRACKET. IT'S NOT RIGHT. WORKERS HERE PLACE CLOSE TO TWICE THAT. CLOSE 230% TRUMP'S TAX CUT FOR THE WEALTHY IS GOING TO COST BILLIONS OF DOLLARS A YEAR DOES YOU AND HI TO COME OUT OF. THE KIDS ARE YOUR HIGH. THE CHAPEL SERVICES INVOLVED TRUMP RAN FOR OFFICE. SAYING HE WOULD REPRESENT FOR GOT MEN AND WOMEN IN THIS COUNTRY. AND THEN ONCE WE GOT IN OFFICE FOR GODDESS. NOT ONLY FORGET THEM ALL THE TRUST THE TRUTH IS THAT- HE NEVER REALLY RESPECTED VERY MUCH. HOW HE LOVES RALLY. THE NEXT TIME YOU HOLDS ONE LOOK CLOSELY. TRUMP KEEPS HIS DISTANCE FROM ANYONE RALLY. THE FOLKS WHO COME ARE PACKED IN TIGHT AS THEY CAN BE. RISKING DISEASE MOSTLY WITHOUT MASS BUT NOT TRUMP. HE SAID HE KEEPS HIS DISTANCE AS A REPORTER THEY SHOWED OF A COUPLE DAYS AGO REPORTER TRYING TO COME UP OR SOME CONSTRUCTION ON A YOU GOTTA KEEP YOUR DISTANCE I DON'T GET CLOSE TO THESE PEOPLE. WE'LL LET EVERYBODY ELSE. THE CROWD RESTAURANT BUT NOT HIM. AND NOW WE KNOW WHAT HE REALLY THINKS OF THE PEOPLE COME TO THIS RALLY FROM SOMEONE WHO SAW IT UP CLOSE AND WROTE ABOUT. OF CLOSE TO THE WHITE HOUSE. THE FORMER EMPLOYEE SAID HE CALLS ON SUPPORTERS PRO DISCUSSED THE- ONE OF THE BENEFITS OF THIS PANDEMIC IS HE DOESN'T HAVE TO SHAKE THEIR HANDS. HE DOESN'T HAVE TO SHAKE YOUR HAND THAT'S A GOOD THING ABOUT. FOR TRUMP THESE RALLIES ARE ABOUT ENTERTAINMENT ADORATION NOT RESPECT. BUT YOU DON'T KID YOURSELF THIS IS A ONE WAY STREET. ALL THE THINGS THE TRUMP OR SEVEN DONE NOTHING IS MORE OFFENSIVE THE WAY SPOKEN ABOUT. ANY OF YOU AND THE BRIEFING THE MINISTER OF THE NATION IN UNIFORM. DOES IT GIVE THE LICENSE TO THIS NATION.

105,s97yjAdqCXg,biden,2020-09-27T16:25:37Z,"LIVE: Biden Delivers Remarks on Trump's Supreme Court Pick in Wilmington, Delaware",speech,good afternoon on friday my wife jill and i had the honor of paying respects to justice ginberg and uh her family first woman first woman in history of our nation to lie and state the u.s capitol and though it should not have taken nearly this long to bestow that honor on a woman it nevertheless speaks to the unique and powerful impact justice ginsburg has made on our society and her her enduring legacy of equal rights and equal justice under the law shortly before justice ginberg's passed she she told her granddaughter and i quote my most fervent wish is that i will not be replaced until a new president is installed and a quote it wasn't a personal request it wasn't a favor being asked for it was the last act of a long unflinching career of standing up for american democracy never before in our nation's history has the supreme court justice been nominated and installed while a presidential election is already underway it defies every precedent every expectation of a nation where the people the people are sovereign and the rule of law reigns but yesterday before justice ginsburg could be laid to rest and after a hundred thousands of americans had already cast their ballots the president nominated a successor to her seat it's no mystery about what's happening here president trump is trying to throw out the affordable care act he's been trying to do it for the last four years the republican party has been trying to eliminate it for a decade twice already the stream the supreme court has upheld that law the affordable care act and the congress expressing the popular will of the american people has rejected president trump's efforts as well now all of a sudden this administration believes they found a loophole in the tragedy of justice ginsburg's death it doesn't matter to them the republicans set the precedent just four years ago when they denied even the courtesy of a hearing to president obama's nominee after justice scalia passed after he had only passed away nine months prior to election day didn't matter to them but millions of americans already voting on a new president in the new congress had begun all that does matter is that they see an opportunity to overturn the affordable care act on their way out the door and as i speak we are still in the midst of the worst global health crisis in a century a crisis has already taken over two hundred thousand lives between seven hundred and fifty and a thousand lives a day and counting and yet the trump administration is asking the supreme court right now as i speak to eliminate the entire affordable care act the administration filed a brief in the supreme court that concludes and i quote the entire aca thus must fall the entire aca thus must fall president trump can claim all he wants is going to protect people with pre-existing conditions but the fact is he's already fighting to take those protections away as we speak if he has his way more than 100 million people with pre-existing conditions like asthma diabetes and cancer could once again be denied coverage complications from covet 19 like lung scarring and heart damage could become the next flood of pre-existing conditions used as an excuse to deny coverage to millions of people women could once again be charged higher premiums just because they are women pregnancy becoming a pre-existing condition again seniors let's see the prescription drug prices go up and the funding for medicare go down it doesn't matter it doesn't matter what the american people want president trump sees a chance to fulfill his explicit mission steal away the vital protections of the aca from countless families who've come to rely on them for their health their financial security the lives of those they love president trump just tweeted an hour ago on my way here and i quote obamacare will be replaced with a much better and far cheaper alternative if it is terminated in the supreme court it would be a big win for the usa it should come as no surprise that on saturday president trump would nominate judge amy coney barrett and on sunday lay out clearly what his objective is to terminate obamacare the judge is written as a written track record written tracker of disagreeing adamantly with the supreme court's decisions on two occasions upholding the aca in fact not as a judge but prior to going on the bench she publicly criticized chief justice roberts opinion upholding the law eight years ago the american people understand the urgency this moment they're already voting in droves because they know their health care hangs in the balance they understand that if donald trump gets his way they could lose the right to vote their right to clean air and water their right to equal pay for equal work workers could lose their collective bargaining rights dreamers could be thrown out of the only country they've ever known and women could lose the bedrock rights enshrined in roe v wade for 50 years people are voting right now because they know the very soul of this country is at stake and because they know that the decisions of the supreme court affect their everyday lives their voices may not matter to donald trump they may not matter to mitch mcconnell but there are senate republicans out there who know in their hearts they should but if they shut out the voices of those during a voting period during an election and closing the door on american democracy thereafter this is where the power of the nation resides in the people in the rule of law in precedence we abide by to subvert both openly and needlessly even as americans cast their vote would be an irreversible step toward the brink and a betrayal of a single quality that america has borne and built on the people decide senate has to stand strong for our democracy they must not act on this nomination until the american people finish the process they're already begun of selecting their president and their congress they've said before if the people choose donald trump then the senate should give his nominee a hearing and a vote if people do not choose trump and choose me president trump's nomination should be withdrawn i should nominate chosen by a president who's just been elected and by the people to get a fair hearing which would not even occur until early february a confirmation vote the u.s concert constitution provides one chance one for the americans to have their voices heard on who serves a lifetime appointment on the supreme court who makes those big decisions about their health care their civil rights and much else that chance is now that moment is now and the voters in my view are not going to stand for this abuse of power and if we're to call ourselves a democracy their voices must be heard i urge the american people to keep voting to let your current senators know that you want to be heard before a vote on confirmation of a new justice i urge every senator to take a step back from the brink take off the blinders of politics for just one critical moment and stand up for the constitution you swore to uphold this is a time to de-escalate to put an end to the shattering of precedence that's thrown our nation in the chaos under this president just because you have the power to do something doesn't absolve you of your responsibility to do right by the american people uphold your constitutional duty summon your conscience stand up for the people stand up for our cherry system of checks and balances americans are watching americans are voting we must listen to them now we must we must allow them to exercise this sacred power so please listen thank you may god bless america may god protect our troops and i'll take a few questions yes republicans sir they force judge barrett's nomination through and confirm they should see to it that the american public will vote on the senate races in this election and they'll vote republicans out of office that's the consequence that's the focus that's why i want to make it clear and stay on message here the clear focus is this is about your health care this is about whether or not the aca will exist this is about whether or not pre-existing conditions will be continued to be covered this is about whether or not a woman can be charged more for the same procedure as a man this is about people's health care in the middle of a pandemic yes you asked me one question fire away no i have not i i concluded that that would put them in a position if they were to vote the right way that they'd be compromised because i called them and so but i know and i have great respect for a number of my republican colleagues my former republican colleagues and uh i'm hoping they will do the right thing he's almost no i have no comment yes i am not and i i i know you're going to be upset with my answer but what i'm not going to do is play the trump game which is a good game he plays take your eye off the issue before us if i were to say yes or no to that that becomes a big issue that's the headline here i am focused on one thing right now and i really mean it i'm focused on making sure the american people understand that they're being cut out of this process they're entitled to be part of and the cutout designed in order to take away the aca and your health care in the midst of a pandemic that's the focus that's what it's on and that's the deal thank you all so very very much thank you what do you what do you feel like you have to accomplish to be successful on tuesday what just tell the truth thank you you,b good afternoon on friday PRON wife jill and i have the honor of pay

The American people have a right to have a say in who the Supreme Court nominee is and that say occurs when they vote for United States Senators and when they vote for the President of United States. They're not going to get that chance now because we're in the middle of an election already. The election has already started. Tens of thousands of people already voted and so the thing that should happen is we should wait. We should wait and see what the outcome of this election is because that's the only way the American people get to express their view is by who they elect as President and who they elect as Vice President. Now, what's at stake here is the President's made it clear, he wants to get rid of the Affordable Care Act. He's been running on that, he ran on that and he's been governing on that. He's in the Supreme Court right now trying to get rid of the Affordable Care Act, which will strip 20 million people from having health insurance now, if it goes into court. And the justice, I'm not opposed to the justice, she seems like a very fine person. But she's written, before she went in the bench, which is her right, that she thinks that the Affordable Care Act is not Constitutional. The other thing that's on the court, and if it's struck down, what happens? Women's rights are fundamentally changed. Once again, a woman could pay more money because she has a pre-existing condition of pregnancy. They're able to charge women more for the same exact procedure a man gets. And that ended when we, in fact, passed the Affordable Care Act, and there's a hundred million people who have pre-existing conditions and they'll be taken away as well. Those pre-existing conditions, insurance companies are going to love this. And so it's just not appropriate to do this before this election. If he wins the election and the Senate is Republican, then he goes forward. If not, we should wait until February. He's elected to the next election. That's simply not true. Open discussion. Number one, he knows what I proposed. What I proposed is that we expand Obamacare and we increase it. We do not wipe any. And one of the big debates we had with 23 of my colleagues trying to win the nomination that I won, were saying that Biden wanted to allow people to have private insurance still. They can. They do. They will under my proposal. That is simply a lie. The party is me. Right now, I am the Democratic Party. I am the Democratic Party right now. The platform of the Democratic Party is what I, in fact, approved of, what I approved of. Now, here's the deal. The deal is that it's going to wipe out pre-existing conditions. And, by the way, the 200,000 people that have died on his watch, how many of those have survived? Well, there's seven million people that contracted COVID. What does it mean for them going forward if you strike down the Affordable Care Act? I'm happy to talk about this. You're not going to be able to shut him up. Let me finish. The point is that the President also is opposed to Roe V. Wade. That's on the ballot as well and the court, in the court, and so that's also at stake right now. And so the election is all- It's on the ballot in the court. In the court. Donald would you just be quiet for a minute. All right. Good healthcare. He has not done healthcare. Yes. It is not. It does not. It's only for those people who are so poor they qualify for Medicaid they can get that free in most States, except Governors who want to deny people who are poor Medicaid. Anyone who qualifies for Medicaid would automatically be enrolled in the public option. The vast majority of the American people would still not be in that option. Number one. Number two. Look, hey. I'm not going to listen to him. The fact of the matter is I beat Bernie Sanders. I beat him by a whole hell of a lot. I'm here standing facing you, old buddy. All he knows how to do- Look he's the deal. I got very lucky. I'm going to get very lucky tonight as well. And tonight I'm going to make sure. Because here's the deal, here's the deal. The fact is that everything he's saying so far is simply a lie. I'm not here to call out his lies. Everybody knows he's a liar. God, I want to make sure- No, he doesn't know how to do that. The wrong guy, the wrong night, at the wrong time. There is no manifesto, number one. Number two. Number two. I'll tell you what, he is not for any help for people needing healthcare. Because he, in fact, already has costs 10 million people their healthcare that they had from their employers because of his recession. Number one. Number two, there are 20 million people getting healthcare through Obamacare now that he wants to take it away. He won't ever look you in the eye and say that's what he wants to do. Take it away. He doesn't know how. He doesn't know how to do that. He has never offered a plan. He has no plan for healthcare. He sends out wishful thinking. He has Executive Orders that have no power. He hasn't lowered drug costs for anybody. He's been promising a healthcare plan since he got elected. He has none, like almost everything else he talks about. He does not have a plan. He doesn't have a plan. And the fact is this man doesn't know what he's talking about. [crosstalk 00:17:14]. Sure. Whatever position I take on that, that'll become the issue. The issue is the American people should speak. You should go out and vote. You're voting now. Vote and let your Senators know strongly how you feel. Vote now. Make sure you, in fact, let people know, your Senators. I'm not going to answer the question. Will you shut up, man? This is so un-Presidential. That was really a productive segment, wasn't it? Keep yapping, man. They sure do. Good luck. 200,000 dead. As you said, over seven million infected in the United States. We, in fact, have 4% of the world's population, 20% of the deaths. 40,000 people a day are contracting COVID. In addition to that, about between 750 and 1000 people a day are dying. When he was presented with that number, he said, ""It is what it is."" Well, it is what it is because you are who you are. That's why it is. The President has no plan. He hasn't laid out anything. He knew all the way back in February how serious this crisis was. He knew it was a deadly disease. What did he do? He's on tape as acknowledging he knew it. He said he didn't tell us or give people a warning of it because he didn't want to panic the American people. You don't panic. He panicked. In addition to that, what did he do? He went in and we were insisting that the people we had in the ground in China should be able to go to Wuhan and determine for themselves how dangerous this was. He did not even ask Xi to do that. He told us what a great job Xi was doing. He said we owe him debt of gratitude for being so transparent with us. And what did he do then? He then did nothing. He waited and waited and waited. He still doesn't have a plan. I laid out back in March, exactly what we should be doing. And I laid out again in July, what we should be doing. We should be providing all the protective gear possible. We should be providing the money the House has passed in order to be able to go out and get people the help they need to keep their businesses open. Open schools cost a lot of money. You should get out of your bunker and get out of the sand trap in your golf course and go in the Oval Office and bring together the Democrats and Republicans and fund what needs to be done now to save lives. I know how to do the job. I know how to get the job done. 14,000 people died, not 200,000. And there was no one ... We didn't shut down the economy. This is his economy he shut down. The reason it's shut down is because, look, you folks at home. How many of you got up this morning and had an empty chair at the kitchen table because someone died of COVID? How many of you are in a situation where you lost your mom or dad and you couldn't even speak to them, you had a nurse holding a phone up so you could in fact say goodbye? His own CDC Director says we could lose as many as another 200,000 people between now and the end of the year. And he said, if we just wear a mask, we can save half those numbers. Just a mask. And by the way, in terms of the whole notion of a vaccine, we're for a vaccine, but I don't trust him at all. Nor do you. I know you don't. What we trust is a scientist. God. This is the same man who told you- ... by Easter, this would be gone away. By the warm weather, it'd be gone. Miraculous, like a miracle. And by the way, maybe you could inject some bleach in your arm, and that would take care of it. This is the same man. So here's the deal. This man is talking about a vaccine. Every serious company is talking about maybe having a vaccine done by the end of the year, but the distribution of that vaccine will not occur until sometime beginning of the middle of next year to get it out, if we get the vaccine. And pray God we will. Pray God we will. No more than the question you just asked him. You pointed out he puts pressure and disagrees with his own scientists. Everybody knows- Well, no, no. You can trust the scientist. She didn't say that. You can trust the- Yes. Well, that's what he's going to try to do, but there's thousands of scientists out there, like here at this great hospital that don't work for him. Their job doesn't depend on him. They're the people... And by the way- By the way- Do you believe for a moment what he's telling you in light of all the lies he's told you about the whole issue relating to COVID? He still hasn't even acknowledged that he knew this was happening, knew how dangerous it was going to be back in February, and he didn't even tell you. He's on record as saying it. He panicked or he just looked at the stock market. One of the two. Because guess what? A lot of people died and a lot more are going to die unless he gets a lot smarter, a lot quicker- Oh, give me a break. Well, let's have this debate- Because he doesn't have a plan. If I were running it, I'd know what the plan is. You've got to provide these businesses the ability to have the money to be able to reopen with the PPE, as well as with the sanitation they need. You have to provide them classic- Will he just shush for a minute? Nancy Pelosi and Schumer, they have a plan. He won't even meet with them. The Republicans won't meet in the Senate. He sits in his golf course. Well, I mean, literally, think about it. Think about it. You just admitted you'd shut it down. I got to respond to that. I got to respond to that. Just like your rally. Look, the way to open businesses is give them the wherewithal to be able open. We provided money, the- Well, masks make a big difference. His own head of the CDC said if we just wore masks between now, if everybody wore a mask and social distanced between now and January, we'd probably save up to 100,000 lives. It matters. It matters. No serious person has said the opposite. No serious person. He did not say the opposite. By the way, did you see one of the last big rallies he had? A reporter came up to him to ask him a question, he said, ""No, no, no. Stand back, put on your mask, put on a mask. Have you been tested? I'm way far away from those other people."" That's what he said, ""I'm going to be okay."" He's not worried about you. He's not worried about the people out there [crosstalk 00:08:48]. No negative effect. Come on. Yes, I would. He's been totally irresponsible the way in which he has handled the social distancing and people wearing masks, basically encouraged them not to. He's a fool on this. The difference is millionaires and billionaires like him in the middle of the COVID crisis have done very well. Billionaires have made another $300 billion because of his profligate tax proposal, and he only focused on the market. But you folks at home, you folks living in Scranton and Claymont and all the small towns and working class towns in America, how well are you doing? This guy paid a total of $750 in taxes. Do I get my time back? The fact is that he has in fact, worked on this in a way that he's going to be the first president of the United States to leave office, having fewer jobs in his administration than when he became president. Fewer jobs than when he became president. First one in American history. Secondly, the people who have lost their jobs are those people who have been on the front lines. Those people who have been saving our lives, those people who have been out there dying. People who've been putting themselves in the way to make sure that we could all try to make it. And the idea that he is insisting that we go forward and open when you have almost half the states in America with a significant increase in COVID deaths and COVID cases in the United States of America, and he wants to open it up more. Why is he want to open it up? Why does he take care of the... You can't fix the economy until you fix the COVID crisis. And he has no intention of doing anything about making it better for you all at home in terms of your health and your safety. Schools. Why aren't schools open? Because it costs a lot of money to open them safely. They were going to give, his administration going to give the teachers and school students masks, and then they decided no, couldn't do that because it's not a national emergency. Not a national emergency. They've done nothing to help small businesses. Nothing. They're closing. One in six is now gone. He ought to get on the job and take care of the needs of the American people so we can open safely. People want to be safe. People want to be safe. Show us your tax returns. Show us your tax returns. Release your tax return. When? In [crosstalk 00:16:04]? Yeah, I do want to respond. Look, the tax code that put him in a position that he pays less tax than on the money a school teacher makes is because of him... He says he's smart because he can take advantage of the tax code. And he does take advantage of the tax code. That's why I'm going to eliminate the Trump tax cuts. And I'm going to eliminate those tax cuts. And make sure that we invest in the people who in fact need the help. People out there need help. Because you weren't president- Because you weren't president and screwing things up. You're the worst president America has ever had. Come on. Well, just take a look at what is the analysis done by Wall Street firms, points out that my economic plan would create 7 million more jobs than his in four years, number one. And number two, it would create an additional $1 trillion in economic growth, because it would be about buying American. The federal government spends $600 billion a year on everything from ships, to steel, to buildings and the like. And under my proposal, we're going to make sure that every penny of that has to be made by a company- By the way, I'm going to eliminate a significant number of the taxes. I'm going to make the corporate tax 28%. It shouldn't be 21%. You have 91 companies federal, I mean, the fortune 500, who don't pay a single penny in tax making billions of dollars. Because you in fact passed that, that was your tax proposal. Yeah, you got it done- The economy- Let me finish. Not lower tax for the American people. Look- ... we inherited the worst recession, short of a depression in American history. I was asked to bring it back. We were able to have an economic recovery that created the jobs you're talking about. We handed him a booming economy, he blew it. He blew it. Yeah, because what he did, even before COVID, manufacturing went in the hole. Manufacturing went in a hole- ... number one. Number two- Number three. No. This guy- We did not. [crosstalk 00:21:21] I'm the guy that brought back the automobile industry. I was asked to bring back Chrysler and General Motors. He brought them back right here in the state of Ohio and Michigan. He blew it. They're gone. He blew it. And in fact, they're gone- That is not true. And so you take a look at what he's actually done. He's done very little. His trade deals are the same way. He talks about these great trade deals. He talks about the art of the deal. China's perfected the art of the steel. We have a higher deficit with China now than we did before. We have the highest trade deficit- ... with Mexico. That is not true. None of that is true. None of that is true. Is totally- Totally discredited. Totally discredited. And by the way- Mr. Vice- That is not true. It is not a fact. It's been totally discredited. My son did nothing wrong at Barisma- He doesn't want to let me answer, because he knows I have the truth. His position has been totally thoroughly discredited- And you can- by everybody. Well, by the media, by our allies. By the World Bank- By everyone, has discredited. And matter of fact [crosstalk 00:23:30] Matter of fact- Even the people who testified under oath- Even the people under- ... testified under oath in his administration said I did my job and I did it very well. I did it honorably. Well, I'll give you the list of the people who- I'm sure that you've already fired most of them, because they did a good job. Well, here's the- [crosstalk 00:23:57] Well, it's hard to get any word in with this clown. Excuse me, this person. No, no. Mr. President- [crosstalk 00:24:05] That is simply not true. Look, here's the deal. We want to talk about families and ethics. I don't want to do that. I mean, his family, we could talk about all night. His family's already- And that's such a- [crosstalk 00:24:25] This is not about my family or his family. It's about your family, the American people. [crosstalk 00:24:32] That's not true. It doesn't want to talk about what you need. You, the American people, it's about you. That's what we're talking about here. [crosstalk 00:24:42] He didn't take that. Try to be honest. That is absolutely not true. That's a good point. It's about equity and equality. It's about decency. It's about the constitution. And we have never walked away from trying to require equity for everyone, equality for the whole of America. But we've never accomplished it, but we've never walked away from it like he has done. It is true, the reason I got in the race is when those people... Close your eyes, remember what those people look like coming out of the fields, carrying torches, their veins bulging, just spewing anti-Semitic bile and accompanied by the Ku Klux Klan. A young woman got killed and they asked the president what he thought. He said, ""There were very fine people on both sides."" No president's ever said anything like that. [crosstalk 00:27:10]. Now- ... second point I'd make to you, is that when Floyd was killed, when Mr. Floyd was killed, there was a peaceful protest in front of the White House. What did he do? He came out of his bunker, had the military use tear gas on them so he could walk across to a church and hold up a Bible. And then what happened after that? The Bishop of that very church said that it was a disgrace. The general who was with him said all he ever wants to do is divide people, not unite people at all. This is a president who has used everything as a dog whistle, to try to generate racists hatred, racist division. This is a man who, in fact, you talk about helping African-Americans, one in 1000 African Americans has been killed because of the coronavirus. And if he doesn't do something quickly, by the end of the year, one in 500 will have been killed. One in 500 African Americans. This man is as a savior of African-Americans? This man cares at all? This man's done virtually nothing. Look, the fact is that you have to look at what he talks about. You have to look at what he did. And what he did has been disastrous for the African-American community. I've never said- Yes, there is. There's systemic injustice in this country, in education and work and in law enforcement and the way in which it's enforced. But look, the vast majority of police officers are good, decent, honorable men and women. They risk their lives every day to take care of us, but there are some bad apples. And when they occur, when they find them, they have to be sorted out. They have to be held accountable. They have to be held accountable. And what I'm going to do as President of the United States is call together an entire group of people at the White House, everything from the civil rights groups, to the police officers, to the police chiefs, and we're going to work this out. We're going to work this out. So we changed the way in which we have more transparency, in when these things happen. These cops aren't happy to see what happened to George Floyd. These cops aren't happy to see what happened to Breonna Taylor. Most don't like it, but we have to have a system where people are held accountable when... And by the way, violence in response is never appropriate, never appropriate. Peaceful protest is, violence is never appropriate. That is not peaceful protest. Nobody's doing that. He's the racist. Here's the deal. I know a lot more about this- [crosstalk 00:15:43]. The fact is that there is racial insensitivity. People have to be made aware of what other people feel like, what insults them, what is demeaning to them. It's important people know. Many people don't want to hurt other people's feelings, but it makes a big difference. It makes a gigantic difference in the way a child is able to grow up and have a sense of self-esteem. It's a little bit like how this guy and his friends look down on so many people. They look down their nose on people like Irish Catholics, like me, who grow up in Scranton. They look down on people who don't have money. They look down on people who are of a different faith. They looked down on people who are a different color. In fact, we're all Americans. The only way we're going to bring this country together is bring everybody together. There's nothing we cannot do, if we do it together. We can take this on and we can defeat racism in American. Oh my Lord. This is ridiculous. Absolutely ridiculous. Violent crime- I'm in favor of law. You- [crosstalk 00:35:15]. Law and order with justice, where people get treated fairly. And the fact of the matter is, violent crime went down 17%, 15% in our administration. It's gone up on his watch. He wouldn't know a suburb unless you took a wrong turn. I was raised in the suburbs. This is not 1950. All these dog whistles and racism don't work anymore. Suburbs are by and large integrated. There's many people today driving their kids to soccer practice and/or black and white and Hispanic in the same car as there have been any time in the past, what really is a threat to the suburbs and their safety is his failure to deal with COVID. They're dying in the suburbs. His failure to deal with the environment, they're being flooded, they're being burned out because his refusal to do anything. That's why the suburbs are in trouble. Look, what I support are the police having the opportunity to deal with the problems they face and I'm totally opposed to defunding the police offices. As a matter of fact police, local police, the only one defunding in his budget calls for a $400 million cut in local law enforcement assistance. They need more assistance. They need when they show up for a 9-11 call to have someone with them as a psychologist or psychiatrist to keep them from having to use force and be able to talk people down. We have to have community policing like we had before where the officers get to know the people in the communities. That's when crime went down, it didn't go up. It went down. And so we have to be... That is not true. That's not true. We don't have time to do anything. I don't hold public office. Now I am a former vice president. I've made it clear. I've made it clear in my public statements that the violence should be prosecuted. It should be prosecuted and anyone who committed it should be prosecuted. They can in fact take care of it if he just stay out of the way. And by the way his own former spokesperson said, “Riots and chaos and violence help he cause.” That's what this is all about. I do. I think Kellyanne Conway. She said that. Here's the point, the point is that that's why he keeps trying to rile everything up. He doesn't want to calm things down instead of going in and talking to people and saying, “Let's get everybody together. Figure out how to deal with this.” What's he do? He just pours gasoline in the fire constantly and every single solitary time. Say it, do it say it. He's own FBI Director said unlike white supremacist, Antifa is an idea not an organization- ... not a militia. That's what his FBI Director said. Every body in your administration tells you the true, it's a bad idea. You have no idea about anything. Under this president, we become weaker, sicker, poor, more divided and more violent. When I was vice president, we inherited a recession. I was asked to fix it. I did. We left him a booming economy and he caused the recession. With regard to being weaker, the fact is that I've gone head to head with Putin and made it clear to him we're not going to take any of his stuff. He's Putin's puppy. He still refuses to even say anything to Putin about the bounty on the heads of American soldiers. By the way, my son... He never keeps his word. Can you get back 30 seconds? So thirdly, we're poor. The billionaires have gotten much more wealthy by a tune of over $3- $400 billion more just since COVID. You in the home, you got less you're in more trouble than you were before. In terms of being more violent. When we were in office there were 15% less violence in America than there is today. He's President United States. It's on his watch. And with regard to more divided the nation, it can't stay divided. We can't be this way. And speaking of my son, the way you talk about the military, the way you talk about them being losers and being and just being suckers. My son was in Iraq. He spent a year there. He got the Brown Star. He got the Conspicuous Service Medal. He was not a loser. He was a Patriot and the people left behind there were heroes. And I resent- I'm talking about my son, Beau Biden, you're talking about Hunter? That's not true he was not dishonorably discharged. None of that is true. That is not true. My son like a lot of people at home had a drug problem. He's overtaking it. He's fixed it. He's worked on it. And I'm proud of him, I'm proud of my son. He wasn't given tens of millions of dollars. [crosstalk 00:48:23] It was all discredited. That is not true. That report is totally discredited. Mitt Romney on that committee said it wasn't worth taxpayer's money. That report was written for political reason. So would I. Why have you relaxed fuel economy standards that are going to create more pollution from cars and trucks? He's absolutely wrong, number one. Number two, if in fact, during our administration in the recovery act, I was in charge able to bring down the cost of renewable energy to cheaper than are as cheap as coal and gas and oil. Nobody's going to build another coal fired plant in America. No one's going to build another oil fire plant in America. They're going to move to renewable energy. Number one, number two, we're going to make sure that we are able to take the federal fleet and turn it into a fleet that's run on their electric vehicles. Making sure that we can do that, we're going to put 500,000 charging stations in all of the highways that we're going to be building in the future. We're going to build a economy that in fact is going to provide for the ability of us to take 4 million buildings and make sure that they in fact are weatherized in a way that in fact will they'll emit significantly less gas and oil because the heat will not be going out. There's so many things that we can do... Gas and oil because the heat will not be going out. There's so many things that we can do now to create thousands and thousands of jobs. We can get to net zero, in terms of energy production, by 2035. Not only not costing people jobs, creating jobs, creating millions of good-paying jobs. Not 15 bucks an hour, but prevailing wage, by having a new infrastructure that in fact, is green. And the first thing I will do, I will rejoin the Paris Accord. I will join the Paris Accord because with us out of it, look what's happening. It's all falling apart. And talk about someone who has no relationship with foreign policy. The rainforests of Brazil are being torn down, are being ripped down. More carbon is absorbed in that rainforest than every bit of carbon that's emitted in the United States. Instead of doing something about that, I would be gathering up and making sure we had the countries of the world coming up with $20 billion, and say, ""Here's $20 billion. Stop tearing down the forest. And If you don't, then you're going to have significant economic consequences."" Well, he hasn't drawn a line. He wants to make sure that methane's not a problem. You can now emit more methane without it being a problem. Methane. This is a guy who says that you don't have to have mileage standards for automobiles that exist now. This is the guy who says that, the fact that- It's all true. And here's the deal- I'm talking about the Biden plan [crosstalk 00:55:51]- No. That is not- Not true- Not true. Not true. Simply... Look- That is simply not the case- What it's going to do, it's going to create thousands and millions of jobs. Good paying jobs [crosstalk 00:02:41]. He doesn't know how to do that- The fact is, it's going to create millions of good paying jobs, and these tax incentives for people to weatherize, which he wants to get rid of. It's going to make the economy much safer. Look how much we're paying now to deal with the hurricanes, deal with... By the way, he has an answer for hurricanes. He said, maybe we should drop a nuclear weapon on them, and they may- Yeah, he did say that- And here's the deal- ... we're going to be in a position where we can create hard, hard, good jobs by making sure the environment is clean, and we all are in better shape. We spend billions of dollars now, billions of dollars, on floods, hurricanes, rising seas. We're in real trouble. Look what's happened just in the Midwest with these storms that come through and wipe out entire sections and counties in Iowa. They didn't happen before. They're because of global warming. We make up 15% of the world's problem. But the rest of the world, we've got to get them to come along. That's why we have to get back into the Paris Accord. For 47- That is not my plan [crosstalk 00:58:10]. The Green New Deal [crosstalk 00:58:14] is not my plan. [crosstalk 00:58:15]- I did not say that- Play it. Play it- The final question is, I can't remember which of all his rantings [crosstalk 00:04:44]. Yeah. The economy- The Green New Deal will pay for itself as we move forward. We're not going to build plants that, in fact, are great polluting plants- Pardon me? No, I don't support the Green New Deal. I support [crosstalk 00:05:13]- I support [crosstalk 00:59:17] the Biden plan that I put forward. The Biden plan, which is different than what he calls the radical Green New Deal. Prepare to let people vote. They should go to iwillvote.com, decide how they're going to vote, when they're going to vote, and what means by which they're going to vote. His own Homeland Security director, and as well as the FBI director, says that there is no evidence at all that mail-in ballots are a source of being manipulated and cheating. They said that. The fact is that there are going to be millions of people because of COVID that are going to be voting by mail-in ballots like he does, by the way. He sits behind the Resolute Desk and sends his ballot to Florida, number one. Number two, we're going to make sure that those people who want to vote in person are able to vote because there are enough poll watchers are there to make sure they can socially distance. The polls are open on time, and the polls stay open until the votes are counted. And this is all about trying to dissuade people from voting because he's trying to scare people into thinking that it's not going to be legitimate. Show up and vote. You will determine the outcome of this election. Vote, vote, vote. If you're able to vote early in your state, vote early. If you're able to vote in person, vote in person. Vote whatever way is the best way for you, because you will... He cannot stop you from being able to determine the outcome of this election. And in terms of whether or not... When the votes are counted and they're all counted, that will be accepted. If I win, that will be accepted. If I lose, that'll be accepted. But by the way, if in fact he says, he's not sure what he's going to accept. Well, let me tell you something, it doesn't matter, because if we get the votes, it's going to be all over. He's going to go. He can't stay in power. It won't happen. It won't happen, so vote. Just make sure you understand, you have it in your control to determine what this country is going to look like the next four years. Is it going to change, or are you going to get four more years of these lies? There is no [crosstalk 01:05:32]... There is no evidence of that- There is no evidence of that- Five states have had mail-in ballots for the last decade or more. Five, including two Republican states. And you don't have to solicit the ballot. It's sent to you. It's sent to your home. What they're saying is that it has to be a postmark by election day. If it doesn't get in until the seventh, eighth, ninth, it still should be counted. He's just afraid of counting the votes- I am concerned that any court would settle this, because here's the deal. When you get a ballot and you fill it out, you're supposed to have an affidavit. If you didn't know, you have someone say that, this is me. You should be able to, if in fact you can verify that's you before the ballot is thrown out, that's sufficient to be able to count the ballot because someone made a mistake and not dotting the correct I. Who they voted for, testify, say who they voted for, say it's you. That is totally legitimate. Mail service delivers [crosstalk 01:07:21] 185 million pieces of mail a day [crosstalk 01:07:24]- Yes. And here's the deal. We count the ballots, as you pointed out. Some of these ballots in some states can't even be opened until election day. And if there's thousands of ballots, it's going to take time to do it. And by the way, our military... They've been voting by ballots since the end of the Civil War, in effect. And that's what's going to happen. Why is it, for them, somehow not fraudulent. It's the same process. It's honest. No one has established at all that there is fraud related to mail-in ballots, that somehow it's a fraudulent process. He has no idea what he's talking about. Here's the deal. The fact is, I will accept it, and he will too. You know why? Because once the winner is declared after all the ballots are counted, all the votes are counted, that'll be the end of it. That'll be the end of it. And if it's me, in fact, fine. If it's not me, I'll support the outcome. And I'll be a president, not just for the Democrats. I'll be a president for Democrats and Republicans. And this guy-",b how PRON do man i m well well first of all thank PRON for do this and look forward to this mr president the american people have a right to have a say in who the supreme court nominee be and that say occur when PRON vote for united states senator and when PRON vote for the president of united states they re not go to get that chance now because we re in the middle of an election already the election have already start ten of thousand of people already vote and so the thing that should happen be PRON should wait PRON should wait and see what the outcome of this election be because that be the only way the american people get to express PRON view be by who PRON elect as president and who PRON elect as vice president now what at stake here be the president make PRON clear PRON want to get rid of the affordable care act he be be run on that PRON run on that and he be be govern on that he be in the supreme court right now try to get rid of the affordable care act which will strip million people from have health insurance now if PRON go into court and the justice i m not opposed to the justice PRON seem like a very fine person but she be write before PRON go in the bench which be PRON right that PRON think that the affordable care act be not constitutional the other thing that be on the court and if it strike down what happen women right be fundamentally change once again a woman could pay more money because PRON have a pre exist condition of pregnancy they re able to charge woman more for the same exact procedure a man get and that end when PRON in fact pass the affordable care act and there be a hundred million people who have pre existing condition and they ll be take away as well those pre existing condition insurance company be go to love this and so it be just not appropriate to do this before this election if PRON win the election and the senate be republican then PRON go forward if not PRON should wait until february he elect to the next election that be simply not true open discussion number one PRON know what i propose what i propose be that PRON expand obamacare and PRON increase PRON PRON do not wipe any and one of the big debate PRON have with of PRON colleague try to win the nomination that i win be say that biden want to allow people to have private insurance still PRON can PRON do PRON will under PRON proposal that be simply a lie the party be PRON right now i be the democratic party i be the democratic party right now the platform of the democratic party be what i in fact approve of what i approve of now here be the deal the deal be that it be go to wipe out pre existing condition and by the way the people that have die on PRON watch how many of those have survive well there seven million people that contract covid what do PRON mean for PRON go forward if PRON strike down the affordable care act i m happy to talk about this you re not go to be able to shut PRON up let PRON finish the point be that the president also be oppose to roe v wade that be on the ballot as well and the court in the court and so that be also at stake right now and so the election be all it be on the ballot in the court in the court donald would PRON just be quiet for a minute all right good healthcare PRON have not do healthcare yes PRON be not PRON do not it be only for those people who be so poor PRON qualify for medicaid PRON can get that free in most state except governor who want to deny people who be poor medicaid anyone who qualify for medicaid would automatically be enrol in the public option the vast majority of the american people would still not be in that option number one number two look hey i m not go to listen to PRON the fact of the matter be i beat bernie sander i beat PRON by a whole hell of a lot i m here stand face PRON old buddy all PRON know how to do look he the deal i get very lucky i m go to get very lucky tonight as well and tonight i m go to make sure because here be the deal here be the deal the fact be that everything he say so far be simply a lie i m not here to call out PRON lie everybody know he be a liar god i want to make sure no PRON doesn t know how to do that the wrong guy the wrong night at the wrong time there be no manifesto number one number two number two i ll tell PRON what PRON be not for any help for people need healthcare because PRON in fact already have cost million people PRON healthcare that PRON have from PRON employer because of PRON recession number one number two there be million people get healthcare through obamacare now that PRON want to take PRON away PRON won t ever look PRON in the eye and say that be what PRON want to do take PRON away PRON doesn t know how PRON doesn t know how to do that PRON have never offer a plan PRON have no plan for healthcare PRON send out wishful thinking PRON have executive order that have no power PRON hasn t lower drug cost for anybody he be be promise a healthcare plan since PRON get elect PRON have none like almost everything else PRON talk about PRON do not have a plan PRON doesn t have a plan and the fact be this man doesn t know what he be talk about crosstalk sure whatever position i take on that that ll become the issue the issue be the american people should speak PRON should go out and vote you re vote now vote and let PRON senator know strongly how PRON feel vote now make sure PRON in fact let people know PRON senator i m not go to answer the question will PRON shut up man this be so un presidential that be really a productive segment wasn t PRON keep yapping man PRON sure do good luck dead as PRON say over seven million infect in the united states PRON in fact have of the world population of the death people a day be contract covid in addition to that about between and people a day be die when PRON be present with that number PRON say PRON be what PRON be well PRON be what PRON be because PRON be who PRON be that be why PRON be the president have no plan PRON hasn t lay out anything PRON know all the way back in february how serious this crisis be PRON know PRON be a deadly disease what do PRON do he on tape as acknowledge PRON know PRON PRON say PRON didn t tell PRON or give people a warning of PRON because PRON didn t want to panic the american people PRON don t panic PRON panic in addition to that what do PRON do PRON go in and PRON be insist that the people PRON have in the ground in china should be able to go to wuhan and determine for PRON how dangerous this be PRON do not even ask xi to do that PRON tell PRON what a great job xi be do PRON say PRON owe PRON debt of gratitude for be so transparent with PRON and what do PRON do then PRON then do nothing PRON wait and wait and wait PRON still doesn t have a plan i lay out back in march exactly what PRON should be do and i lay out again in july what PRON should be do PRON should be provide all the protective gear possible PRON should be provide the money the house have pass in order to be able to go out and get people the help PRON need to keep PRON business open open school cost a lot of money PRON should get out of PRON bunker and get out of the sand trap in PRON golf course and go in the oval office and bring together the democrats and republicans and fund what need to be do now to save life i know how to do the job i know how to get the job do people die not and there be no one PRON didn t shut down the economy this be PRON economy PRON shut down the reason it shut down be because look PRON folk at home how many of PRON get up this morning and have an empty chair at the kitchen table because someone die of covid how many of PRON be in a situation where PRON lose PRON mom or dad and PRON couldn t even speak to PRON PRON have a nurse hold a phone up so PRON could in fact say goodbye PRON own cdc director say PRON could lose as many as another people between now and the end of the year and PRON say if PRON just wear a mask PRON can save half those number just a mask and by the way in term of the whole notion of a vaccine we re for a vaccine but i don t trust PRON at all nor do PRON i know PRON don t what PRON trust be a scientist god this be the same man who tell you by easter this would be go away by the warm weather it d be go miraculous like a miracle and by the way maybe PRON could inject some bleach in PRON arm and that would take care of PRON this be the same man so here be the deal this man be talk about a vaccine every serious company be talk about maybe have a vaccine do by the end of the year but the distribution of that vaccine will not occur until sometime begin of the middle of next year to get PRON out if PRON get the vaccine and pray god PRON will pray god PRON will no more than the question PRON just ask PRON PRON point out PRON put pressure and disagree with PRON own scientist everybody knows well no no PRON can trust the scientist PRON didn t say that PRON can trust the yes well that be what he be go to try to do but there thousand of scientist out there like here at this great hospital that don t work for PRON PRON job doesn t depend on PRON they re the people and by the way by the way do PRON believe for a moment what he tell PRON in light of all the lie he tell PRON about the whole issue relate to covid PRON still hasn t even acknowledge that PRON know this be happen know how dangerous PRON be go to be back in february and PRON didn t even tell PRON he on record as say PRON PRON panic or PRON just look at the stock market one of the two because guess what a lot of people die and a lot more be go to die unless PRON get a lot smart a lot quicker oh give PRON a break well let have this debate because PRON doesn t have a plan if i be run PRON i d know what the plan be you ve get to provide these business the ability to have the money to be able to reopen with the ppe as well as with the sanitation PRON need PRON have to provide PRON classic will PRON just shush for a minute nancy pelosi and schumer PRON have a plan PRON won t even meet with PRON the republicans won t meet in the senate PRON sit in PRON golf course well i mean literally think about PRON think about PRON PRON just admit you d shut PRON down i get to respond to that i get to respond to that just like PRON rally look the way to open business be give PRON the wherewithal to be able open PRON provide money the well mask make a big difference PRON own head of the cdc say if PRON just wear mask between now if everybody wear a mask and social distance between now and january we d probably save up to life PRON matter PRON matter no serious person have say the opposite no serious person PRON do not say the opposite by the way do PRON see one of the last big rally PRON have a reporter come up to PRON to ask PRON a question PRON say no no no stand back put on PRON mask put on a mask have PRON be test i m way far away from those other people that be what PRON say i m go to be okay he be not worried about PRON he be not worried about the people out there crosstalk no negative effect come on yes i would he be be totally irresponsible the way in which PRON have handle the social distancing and people wear mask basically encourage PRON not to he be a fool on this the difference be millionaire and billionaire like PRON in the middle of the covid crisis have do very well billionaire have make another $ billion because of PRON profligate tax proposal and PRON only focus on the market but PRON folk at home PRON folk live in scranton and claymont and all the small town and work class town in america how well be PRON do this guy pay a total of $ in taxis do i get PRON time back the fact be that PRON have in fact work on this in a way that he be go to be the first president of the united states to leave office have few job in PRON administration than when PRON become president few job than when PRON become president first one in american history secondly the people who have lose PRON job be those people who have be on the front line those people who have be save PRON life those people who have be out there die people who ve be put PRON in the way to make sure that PRON could all try to make PRON and the idea that PRON be insist that PRON go forward and open when PRON have almost half the state in america with a significant increase in covid death and covid case in the united states of america and PRON want to open PRON up more why be PRON want to open PRON up why do PRON take care of the PRON can t fix the economy until PRON fix the covid crisis and PRON have no intention of do anything about make PRON well for PRON all at home in term of PRON health and PRON safety school why aren t school open because PRON cost a lot of money to open PRON safely PRON be go to give PRON administration go to give the teacher and school student mask and then PRON decide no couldn t do that because it be not a national emergency not a national emergency they ve do nothing to help small business nothing they re closing one in six be now go PRON ought to get on the job and take care of the need of the american people so PRON can open safely people want to be safe people want to be safe show PRON PRON tax return show PRON PRON tax return release PRON tax return when in crosstalk yeah i do want to respond look the tax code that put PRON in a position that PRON pay less tax than on the money a school teacher make be because of PRON PRON say he smart because PRON can take advantage of the tax code and PRON do take advantage of the tax code that why i m go to eliminate the trump tax cut and i m go to eliminate those tax cut and make sure that PRON invest in the people who in fact need the help people out there need help because PRON weren t president because PRON weren t president and screw thing up you re the bad president america have ever have come on well just take a look at what be the analysis do by wall street firm point out that PRON economic plan would create million more job than PRON in four year number one and number two PRON would create an additional $ trillion in economic growth because PRON would be about buy american the federal government spend $ billion a year on everything from ship to steel to building and the like and under PRON proposal we re go to make sure that every penny of that have to be make by a company by the way i m go to eliminate a significant number of the taxis i m go to make the corporate tax PRON shouldn t be PRON have company federal i mean the fortune who don t pay a single penny in tax make billion of dollar because PRON in fact pass that that be PRON tax proposal yeah PRON get PRON done the economy let PRON finish not lower tax for the american people look PRON inherit the bad recession short of a depression in american history i be ask to bring PRON back PRON be able to have an economic recovery that create the job you re talk about PRON hand PRON a booming economy PRON blow PRON PRON blow PRON yeah because what PRON do even before covid manufacturing go in the hole manufacturing go in a hole number one number two number three no this guy PRON do not crosstalk i m the guy that bring back the automobile industry i be ask to bring back chrysler and general motors PRON bring PRON back right here in the state of ohio and michigan PRON blow PRON they re go PRON blow PRON and in fact they re gone that be not true and so PRON take a look at what he actually do he be do very little PRON trade deal be the same way PRON talk about these great trade deal PRON talk about the art of the deal china perfect the art of the steel PRON have a high deficit with china now than PRON do before PRON have the high trade deficit with mexico that be not true none of that be true none of that be true be totally totally discredit totally discredit and by the way mr vice that be not true PRON be not a fact it be be totally discredit PRON son do nothing wrong at barisma PRON doesn t want to let PRON answer because PRON know i have the truth PRON position have be totally thoroughly discredited and PRON can by everybody well by the medium by PRON ally by the world bank by everyone have discredit and matter of fact crosstalk matter of fact even the people who testify under oath even the people under testify under oath in PRON administration say i do PRON job and i do PRON very well i do PRON honorably well i ll give PRON the list of the people who i m sure that you ve already fire most of PRON because PRON do a good job well here be the crosstalk well it be hard to get any word in with this clown excuse PRON this person no no mr president crosstalk that be simply not true look here be the deal PRON want to talk about family and ethic i don t want to do that i mean PRON family PRON could talk about all night PRON family already and that such a crosstalk this be not about PRON family or PRON family it be about PRON family the american people crosstalk that be not true PRON doesn t want to talk about what PRON need PRON the american people it be about PRON that be what we re talk about here crosstalk PRON didn t take that try to be honest that be absolutely not true that be a good point it be about equity and equality it be about decency it be about the constitution and PRON have never walk away from try to require equity for everyone equality for the whole of america but we ve never accomplish PRON but we ve never walk away from PRON like PRON have do PRON be true the reason i get in the race be when those people close PRON eye remember what those people look like come out of the field carry torch PRON vein bulge just spew anti semitic bile and accompany by the ku klux klan a young woman get kill and PRON ask the president what PRON think PRON say there be very fine people on both side no president ever say anything like that crosstalk now second point i d make to PRON be that when floyd be kill when mr floyd be kill there be a peaceful protest in front of the white house what do PRON do PRON come out of PRON bunker have the military use tear gas on PRON so PRON could walk across to a church and hold up a bible and then what happen after that the bishop of that very church say that PRON be a disgrace the general who be with PRON say all PRON ever want to do be divide people not unite people at all this be a president who have use everything as a dog whistle to try to generate racist hatred racist division this be a man who in fact PRON talk about help african americans one in african americans have be kill because of the coronavirus and if PRON doesn t do something quickly by the end of the year one in will have be kill one in african americans this man be as a savior of african americans this man care at all this man be do virtually nothing look the fact be that PRON have to look at what PRON talk about PRON have to look at what PRON do and what PRON do have be disastrous for the african american community i ve never said yes there be there systemic injustice in this country in education and work and in law enforcement and the way in which it enforce but look the vast majority of police officer be good decent honorable man and woman PRON risk PRON life every day to take care of PRON but there be some bad apple and when PRON occur when PRON find PRON PRON have to be sort out PRON have to be hold accountable PRON have to be hold accountable and what i m go to do as president of the united states be call together an entire group of people at the white house everything from the civil right group to the police officer to the police chief and we re go to work this out we re go to work this out so PRON change the way in which PRON have more transparency in when these thing happen these cop aren t happy to see what happen to george floyd these cop aren t happy to see what happen to breonna taylor most don t like PRON but PRON have to have a system where people be hold accountable when and by the way violence in response be never appropriate never appropriate peaceful protest be violence be never appropriate that be not peaceful protest nobody be do that he be the racist here be the deal i know a lot more about this crosstalk the fact be that there be racial insensitivity people have to be make aware of what other people feel like what insult PRON what be demean to PRON it important people know many people don t want to hurt other people feeling but PRON make a big difference PRON make a gigantic difference in the way a child be able to grow up and have a sense of self esteem it be a little bit like how this guy and PRON friend look down on so many people PRON look down PRON nose on people like irish catholics like PRON who grow up in scranton PRON look down on people who don t have money PRON look down on people who be of a different faith PRON look down on people who be a different color in fact we re all americans the only way we re go to bring this country together be bring everybody together there nothing PRON can not do if PRON do PRON together PRON can take this on and PRON can defeat racism in american oh my lord this be ridiculous absolutely ridiculous violent crime i m in favor of law you crosstalk law and order with justice where people get treat fairly and the fact of the matter be violent crime go down in PRON administration it be go up on PRON watch PRON wouldn t know a suburb unless PRON take a wrong turn i be raise in the suburb this be not all these dog whistle and racism don t work anymore suburb be by and large integrated there many people today drive PRON kid to soccer practice and or black and white and hispanic in the same car as there have be any time in the past what really be a threat to the suburb and PRON safety be PRON failure to deal with covid they re die in the suburb PRON failure to deal with the environment they re be flood they re be burn out because PRON refusal to do anything that be why the suburb be in trouble look what i support be the police have the opportunity to deal with the problem PRON face and i m totally opposed to defunde the police office as a matter of fact police local police the only one defunding in PRON budget call for a $ million cut in local law enforcement assistance PRON need more assistance PRON need when PRON show up for a call to have someone with PRON as a psychologist or psychiatrist to keep PRON from have to use force and be able to talk people down PRON have to have community police like PRON have before where the officer get to know the people in the community that be when crime go down PRON didn t go up PRON go down and so PRON have to be that be not true that be not true PRON don t have time to do anything i don t hold public office now i be a former vice president i ve make PRON clear i ve make PRON clear in PRON public statement that the violence should be prosecute PRON should be prosecute and anyone who commit PRON should be prosecute PRON can in fact take care of PRON if PRON just stay out of the way and by the way PRON own former spokesperson say riot and chaos and violence help PRON cause that be what this be all about i do i think kellyanne conway PRON say that here be the point the point be that that why PRON keep try to rile everything up PRON doesn t want to calm thing down instead of go in and talk to people and say let get everybody together figure out how to deal with this what be PRON do PRON just pour gasoline in the fire constantly and every single solitary time say PRON do PRON say PRON he own fbi director say unlike white supremacist antifa be an idea not an organization not a militia that be what PRON fbi director say every body in PRON administration tell PRON the true it be a bad idea PRON have no idea about anything under this president PRON become weak sicker poor more divided and more violent when i be vice president PRON inherit a recession i be ask to fix PRON i do PRON leave PRON a booming economy and PRON cause the recession with regard to be weak the fact be that i ve go head to head with putin and make PRON clear to PRON we re not go to take any of PRON stuff he putin puppy PRON still refuse to even say anything to putin about the bounty on the head of american soldier by the way PRON son PRON never keep PRON word can PRON get back second so thirdly we re poor the billionaire have get much more wealthy by a tune of over $ $ billion more just since covid PRON in the home PRON get less you re in more trouble than PRON be before in term of be more violent when PRON be in office there be less violence in america than there be today he president united states it be on PRON watch and with regard to more divide the nation PRON can t stay divided PRON can t be this way and speak of PRON son the way PRON talk about the military the way PRON talk about PRON be loser and be and just be sucker PRON son be in iraq PRON spend a year there PRON get the brown star PRON get the conspicuous service medal PRON be not a loser PRON be a patriot and the people leave behind there be hero and i resent i m talk about PRON son beau biden you re talk about hunter that be not true PRON be not dishonorably discharge none of that be true that be not true PRON son like a lot of people at home have a drug problem he overtake PRON he fix PRON he work on PRON and i m proud of PRON i m proud of PRON son PRON wasn t give ten of million of dollar crosstalk PRON be all discredit that be not true that report be totally discredit mitt romney on that committee say PRON wasn t worth taxpayer money that report be write for political reason so would i why have PRON relaxed fuel economy standard that be go to create more pollution from car and truck he be absolutely wrong number one number two if in fact during PRON administration in the recovery act i be in charge able to bring down the cost of renewable energy to cheap than be as cheap as coal and gas and oil nobody be go to build another coal fire plant in america no one be go to build another oil fire plant in america they re go to move to renewable energy number one number two we re go to make sure that PRON be able to take the federal fleet and turn PRON into a fleet that run on PRON electric vehicle make sure that PRON can do that we re go to put charge station in all of the highway that we re go to be build in the future we re go to build a economy that in fact be go to provide for the ability of PRON to take million building and make sure that PRON in fact be weatherize in a way that in fact will they ll emit significantly less gas and oil because the heat will not be go out there be so many thing that PRON can do gas and oil because the heat will not be go out there be so many thing that PRON can do now to create thousand and thousand of job PRON can get to net zero in term of energy production by not only not cost people job create job create million of good pay job not buck an hour but prevail wage by have a new infrastructure that in fact be green and the first thing i will do i will rejoin the paris accord i will join the paris accord because with PRON out of PRON look what happening it be all fall apart and talk about someone who have no relationship with foreign policy the rainforest of brazil be be tear down be be rip down more carbon be absorb in that rainfor than every bit of carbon that emit in the united states instead of do something about that i would be gather up and make sure PRON have the country of the world come up with $ billion and say here $ billion stop tear down the forest and if PRON don t then you re go to have significant economic consequence well PRON hasn t draw a line PRON want to make sure that methane be not a problem PRON can now emit more methane without PRON be a problem methane this be a guy who say that PRON don t have to have mileage standard for automobile that exist now this be the guy who say that the fact that it be all true and here be the deal i m talk about the biden plan crosstalk no that be not not true not true not true simply look that be simply not the case what it be go to do it be go to create thousand and million of job good pay job crosstalk PRON doesn t know how to do that the fact be it be go to create million of good pay job and these tax incentive for people to weatherize which PRON want to get rid of it be go to make the economy much safe look how much we re pay now to deal with the hurricane deal with by the way PRON have an answer for hurricane PRON say maybe PRON should drop a nuclear weapon on PRON and PRON may yeah PRON do say that and here be the deal we re go to be in a position where PRON can create hard hard good job by make sure the environment be clean and PRON all be in well shape PRON spend billion of dollar now billion of dollar on flood hurricane rise sea we re in real trouble look what happen just in the midwest with these storm that come through and wipe out entire section and county in iowa PRON didn t happen before they re because of global warming PRON make up of the world problem but the rest of the world we ve get to get PRON to come along that be why PRON have to get back into the paris accord for that be not PRON plan crosstalk the green new deal crosstalk be not PRON plan crosstalk i do not say that play PRON play it the final question be i can t remember which of all PRON ranting crosstalk yeah the economy the green new deal will pay for PRON as PRON move forward we re not go to build plant that in fact be great pollute plants pardon PRON no i don t support the green new deal i support crosstalk i support crosstalk the biden plan that i put forward the biden plan which be different than what PRON call the radical green new deal prepare to let people vote PRON should go to iwillvote com decide how they re go to vote when they re go to vote and what mean by which they re go to vote PRON own homeland security director and as well as the fbi director say that there be no evidence at all that mail in ballot be a source of be manipulate and cheat PRON say that the fact be that there be go to be million of people because of covid that be go to be vote by mail in ballot like PRON do by the way PRON sit behind the resolute desk and send PRON ballot to florida number one number two we re go to make sure that those people who want to vote in person be able to vote because there be enough poll watcher be there to make sure PRON can socially distance the poll be open on time and the poll stay open until the vote be count and this be all about try to dissuade people from voting because he be try to scare people into think that it be not go to be legitimate show up and vote PRON will determine the outcome of this election vote vote vote if you re able to vote early in PRON state vote early if you re able to vote in person vote in person vote whatever way be the good way for PRON because PRON will PRON can not stop PRON from be able to determine the outcome of this election and in term of whether or not when the vote be count and they re all count that will be accept if i win that will be accept if i lose that ll be accept but by the way if in fact PRON say he be not sure what he be go to accept well let PRON tell PRON something PRON doesn t matter because if PRON get the vote it be go to be all over he be go to go PRON can t stay in power PRON won t happen PRON won t happen so vote just make sure PRON understand PRON have PRON in PRON control to determine what this country be go to look like the next four year be PRON go to change or be PRON go to get four more year of these lie there be no crosstalk there be no evidence of that there be no evidence of that five state have have mail in ballot for the last decade or more five include two republican state and PRON don t have to solicit the ballot it send to PRON it send to PRON home what they re say be that PRON have to be a postmark by election day if PRON doesn t get in until the seventh eighth ninth PRON still should be count he just afraid of count the votes i be concerned that any court would settle this because here be the deal when PRON get a ballot and PRON fill PRON out you re suppose to have an affidavit if PRON didn t know PRON have someone say that this be PRON PRON should be able to if in fact PRON can verify that be PRON before the ballot be throw out that be sufficient to be able to count the ballot because someone make a mistake and not dot the correct i who PRON vote for testify say who PRON vote for say it be PRON that be totally legitimate mail service deliver crosstalk million piece of mail a day crosstalk yes and here be the deal PRON count the ballot as PRON point out some of these ballot in some state can t even be open until election day and if there thousand of ballot it be go to take time to do PRON and by the way PRON military they ve be vote by ballot since the end of the civil war in effect and that what be go to happen why be PRON for PRON somehow not fraudulent it be the same process it honest no one have establish at all that there be fraud relate to mail in ballot that somehow it be a fraudulent process PRON have no idea what he be talk about here be the deal the fact be i will accept PRON and PRON will too PRON know why because once the winner be declare after all the ballot be count all the vote be count that ll be the end of PRON that ll be the end of PRON and if it PRON in fact fine if it be not PRON i ll support the outcome and i ll be a president not just for the democrats i ll be a president for democrats and republicans and this guy
111,RtOB47APY3A,biden,2020-09-30T22:18:20Z,Joe Biden holds campaign event in Pennsylvania,speech,honor on behalf of our 550 000 men and women that we represent to endorse joe biden for president and kamala harris for vice president you're welcome vice president you know leaders stand up for what's right even when it's hard that's joe biden leaders tell the truth even when it's inconvenient that's joe biden leaders understand that the strength of our country is tied to the strength of the middle class that means strong unions protection for workers and a fair tax policy joe biden knows that joe stands with working americans and knows the value the union brings to our communities joe stands with working carpenters and because of that we're proud to stand with joe biden the next president of the united states thank you [Applause] good evening my name is james callahan i'm the general president of the operating engineers 400 members strong 400 000 members strong and it's our honor to have the next president of the united states tour our great local 66 training center that underscores what we do in labor and if we didn't have to it wasn't a far reach to explain to someone like joe biden what working americans do i want to thank jim kuntz the president and vice president of local 66 my secretary treasurer brian hickey who's flown in from chicago to underscore and relay to vice president biden that we at our general executive board wholly endorse him and senator harris for the next ticket of the president and vice president of the united states as i as joe said to us many a times he understands what a paycheck does to working people not a dividend check for people that are just waiting for a dividend check on their savings or their investment he understands that people live check to check and the guidance that go with that and the way that this administration current administration wants to tear that down so we wholeheartedly endorse as the next president of the united states joe biden thank you very much i better not touch it hello everybody it's great to be here i just want the record to show that jim promised if i get elected president united states i can go down to houston facility and work and try to drive any of this machinery i get a shot at i used to have a license to drive tractor trailers but i tell you what i'm looking to get that sucker that big caterpillar that's a good one but i'm not sure i want to try that crane man that looks awful that looks awful tough i know well i'll tell you what it's great to be here you know there was an old expression when i was growing up in scranton you go home with them that bring you to the dance and labor brought me to the dance a long long time ago they're the ones who are the operating engineers and the carpenters early on first time that i ran people who laid the tracks in the pipeline to operate the cranes and shape the skyline and build the foundations of everything we rely on labor as i said brought me to the dance not an exaggeration and the only reason i'm standing here today as a candidate for president if i hadn't been for the labor back in 1972 when i was a 29 year old kid just after labor day i was losing the election i think it was 54 to 19 going into the election and then labor came on board carpenters across the board just up and down operating engineers the steel workers and we ended up winning by a overwhelming margin of 3200 votes statewide when nixon won the state with 68 percent of the vote so i don't forget and my dad used to have an expression for real he said the only way to deal with the abuse of power joey is with power and the only people can take on the major corporate interests and the oligarchs who are abusing power the working men and women are organized labor that's not that's not an exaggeration the only ones the only ones and that's why i've been so supportive of labor my whole career i've never forgotten everything that they've done for me you've done for me but not just for me but for the country you are literally not figuratively the backbone of america the military is the spine of america you're the backbone of america an awful lot of you served in the military as well you're the ones who actually built this country not wall street bankers and ceos you built the country and you're going to build it you're going to build it back better than it was before and i want to thank uh jim i want to thank president callahan and his team as well as the folks in local 66 for welcoming here today and giving us an inside look at everything you're doing to rebuild and energize western pennsylvania i'm from eastern pennsylvania i'm from up in lackawanna county in that valley and a lot a lot's gonna happen here i'm i am so confident i really am that we're not only coming back we're going to come back big i mean i mean hard-working folks i want to thank vice president frank spencer and the carpenters for all they do as well i'm honored to trust your place to man i want to thank you a lot for it and if i have the honor becoming president i'll be fighting for you every single day and i promise you hear me now you will have a seat at the table at the white house no fundamental decisions will be made without you sitting in literally not figuratively literally that's a word you have my word on it and folks you know i've i've been on a train today i've traveled just kind of like going back home i i traveled over 2 million 100 000 miles over 40 years on amtrak going back and forth every single solitary night to see my kids a 250 mile round trip but we came today we ran around an amtrak train to do a whistle-stop tour we started off in cleveland across ohio and went to western pennsylvania and riding the rails uh reminds me of when i would take the train home from wilmington to washington and back every night and i used to go back when you get through beyond the beltway going into baltimore you go through a number of middle-class neighborhoods like houses like like i grew up in three-bedroom split-level homes that kind of thing and i used to literally when we have debates on the floor of the senate i'd look out that window and i'd sit there and i'd see the lights on and the homes were passing just like we saw coming from cleveland into pittsburgh and pittsburgh to here and i'd wonder do they have the same kind of conversations at that table that my mom and dad had at our table are they having the same kind of conversations the guys i grew up with and women i grew up with dad no honey we can't get four new tires in the car we can't we can't afford it we got to wait another month literally not figuratively literally or you know i know i you know i i know we need a new hot water heater but we can't afford it we got to wait it's going to take a little while longer you have a vast majority of the middle class saying before we got into this recession that if they got a bill for for an unexpected bill for 400 in a month that they didn't expect that you have to borrow the money or put it off they're neighbors i grew up in and you're the only ones that have saved them from people from having to do that if in fact you're able to have work you know folks i knew all those families inside and those families and on that route today i didn't know their names but i know what was on their minds and what their concerns were they're not looking for a handout all they're looking for is a hand up my dad used to say joe i don't expect the government to solve my problems but i sure didn't expect them to understand my problem we're not understanding the problems of the vast majority of americans today all they're looking for is a fair shot and a little bit of dignity and a little bit of respect instead of being looked down on so that the parents could look their kids in the eye and say honey everything's going to be okay my dad just had that expression and jobs a lot after we left scranton and he had to move to delaware and commute every day for over a year and then finally be able to get us down not every day once a week come back every week and finally we got to go to we got apartment and climb on delaware a little still town has no more steel now but and then we finally ever get a home four years later but you know it's um it's what a lot of people are still going through there's a stark difference from what i saw last night on the debate stage an entitled self-serving president who inherited everything in his life and squandered it a president who calls his own supporters according to some staff members his own supporters disgusting who thinks that folks who put their lives on in line for our country in the military are losers and suckers it's despicable i've dealt with guys like trump my whole life the guys who might let you park the cars at their country club pick up a few bucks but even if you had the money wouldn't let you join that country club because you're religion or because of your background guys who stiff contractors building their hotels and their golf courses just to put a few more bucks in their pocket and seem to take some joy in it guys who think the rules don't apply to them guys who make tens of millions of dollars and pay 750 dollars in federal taxes in a year donald trump sees things from park avenue i see him from where i grew up in scranton and clemont my mom gene finnegan biden had a backbone like a ramrod all five foot one of her but my mom used to have an expression i really mean it i used to be a stutterer and it's when you're a stutter you're used to bullies it's easy to make fun of somebody who talks like that that's how i learned to fight the joke used to be brides like shoe leather you can beat him but he's going to hurt you because you have to stand up to these folks well my mom would say joey look at me look at me remember nobody is better than you nobody but everybody's your equal and she meant it she meant it as i said you know my dad's expression when we moved to delaware so you talk about how a job is a lot more than about a paycheck it's about your dignity it's about respect it's about your place in the community those values shaped my whole life if you look back on my career you notice it shaped my whole career my build back better plan it shaped my views as president what i'll do it's all about giving communities like greensburg and new alexandria and claymont and scranton and places in parts of cleveland i just came out of given women and men who work on pipelines and construction sites a fair shot we're going to invest two trillion dollars in infrastructure including more than 50 billion in one year to get to repairing our schools our highways our bridges revitalizing our locks and our dams making our inland waterways the finest in the world that's what attracts businesses that's what brings employment they talk about how much my plan cost well guess what those investments are going to create millions of high-paying jobs building a modern infrastructure and a durable energy future i promise you this in my administration collective bargaining now hear me collective bargaining will be sacred it's a guarantee a guarantee and union apprenticeships union apprenticeships will be sacred the last thing we need is corporate america taking over apprenticeships programs like they tried to do we're going to stand up for prevailing wage and benefit predictions of the davis-bacon act i had a guarantee you may recall the president who used to like to surprise me at state of the union addresses says and sheriff joe will take care of the bill back and we didn't call bill back better as a recovery act 800 billion dollars not a single project was not prevailing wage as a guarantee every single solitary project we built and so folks we're going to level the playing field for you and for your families we're going to have wages and benefits we're going to lower healthcare costs prescription drug prices we're going to take on the opioid crisis for real with effective treatment making four years of public college universities apprentice programs tuition-free anybody making less than 125 000 a year if they go to a state university they go to a community college it's automatic if they're an apprentice program it's going to be free my wife has an expression she's a community college professor any country that out educates us will out-compete us and the cost is staggering for people having to carry the burden and we're going to do without asking anyone who makes under 400 000 a year to pay one more penny in taxes guarantee my word on it because what we're going to do we're going to get rid of that god-awful 2 trillion dollar tax cut that trump passed 1.4 trillion going to the top 1 significant portion that going the top 1 10th of one percent we're going to start rewarding work not wealth we're going to make sure corporations begin to pay their free you know the fortune 500 companies 91 don't pay a single penny in taxes and some of them make multi-billion dollars how about your taxes you pay no nothing in taxes we're not going to punish anybody everyone's going to pay their fair share look a lot of people around here voted for donald trump last time i get it i understand why i've been asked many times in recent years how do we get to a place where the people who teach our kids take care of our sick build our bridges operate our cranes who race into burning buildings and don't ask who's in the other in there whether you're black or white or muslim or christian people who who in fact grow our food how do we get to a place where they don't think we don't see them or hear them or respect them well i see them i hear them i respect them i know them they're family and it's going to change it's going to change with me look this is not a partisan moment this is an american moment and i mean that seriously think about it we have a chance to put the anger and division has overtaken this country behind us we can be what we are at our best one people one america we just need to remember who in god's name we are this is the united states of america think about this never once in our history when we've set our mind to it have we not been able to accomplish whatever we set our mind to when we've done it together there's not a single thing we can't do and with your help i'm going to get elected and with us working together i promise you i promise you there's going to be a different america we again reward work not just wealth where people are treated with i'll decency by saying a president's words matter no matter how good or bad a president is the words they utter matter they can take us to war they can bring peace it can make the market rise or fall it can change people's lives this president has hate and division under the rocks here hate only hides it doesn't go away and it matters what presidents say you heard he said last night when he was asked by the moderator when you condemn white supremacy and he fuddled around didn't say anything i said how about the proud boys and he said well in context of lexi said just tell them to stand down and stand by go online look at problems they've got a new emblem now literally it says stand down and stand by implying that if he loses the election something may have to be done i promise you that won't happen the american people are going to speak they're going to speak in large numbers and nobody is going to get in the way of our democratic process going forward nobody period this is the united states of america we're not some tin horn dictatorship or a third world country it's the united states of america so i want to thank you all for your endorsements i really mean it it means a lot to me personally just on a personal level i appreciate it so god bless you all and may god protect our troops thank you so very

outlined by health experts in the state of michigan thanks everyone please welcome our first speaker an essential worker at a grocery store and a ufcw local 876 member matt hoffman thank you mr vice president for the opportunity to speak about what essential grocery workers including countless ufcw members like myself are dealing with my name is matt hoffman and i'm a grocery store worker in emily city michigan and i have been on the front lines of the pandemic since day one working around the clock to help make sure families in my community have the food they need during this crisis i live in a small town and our community has been devastated by cobia 19 and the damage it has done to our economy over these many months there is not a day that goes by workers like me are not putting our lives on the line in the beginning we had no productive equipment and were even told we would be sent home without pay if we wore mass or gloves on the job the health risks we face are real we interact with the public every day we are vital to the food supply but we cannot do our job if we are not protected essential workers like us deserve essential precautions like hazard pay i am here today because we need to build a better america than one we see we need to create good jobs we need to make sure employers do the right and pay us for the risks we face we can't afford to listen to companies that make billions in profit and then cut hazard pay we need a leader who puts hard-working men and women and their families first this is why i'm supporting joe biden lastly i would like to urge all my friends and family regardless of their party to vote for vice president biden so we can have a president who prior towards us in our jobs from everything i've heard you say and the way you clearly care for others i know you are the leader we need thank you again for listening to michigan workers and welcome mr vice president hey folks good afternoon before i start let me explain the delay we wanted to make sure that we're doing everything by the numbers and so i uh got two uh two coveted tests this morning one in delaware and one by the former white house doc who came up and everything's cleared we want to make sure everything was clear before i came we were supposed to have an event after this at a uh at a headquarters but uh based on the crowd size and an indoor was concluded by the doc said best not to do it but i want to thank all of you i want to thank matt and matt you're dead right you were putting yourself on the line and a lot of other people did all across this country in your union and i want to thank david way secretary treasurer of local 951 uh for having me here today look let's i'd like to start by acknowledging which i'm sure all of you do as well sending my prayers for the health and safety of the first lady and president of president united states after they tested positive for coven 19. my wife jill and i prayed that they'll make a quick and full recovery this is not a matter of politics it's a bracing reminder to all of us that we have to take this virus seriously it's not going away automatically we have to do our part to be responsible means following the science listening to the experts washing our hands social distancing it means wearing a mask in public and means encouraging others to do so as well it means having masking mandates nationwide the director of the cdc center for disease control dr redfield said and i quote and he held up a mask he said these face masks are the most important powerful public health tool we have then he held the mask up again and said this face mask is more guaranteed to protect me against covid than a vaccine end of quote leading scientists from the university of washington tell us that we can save more than one hundred thousand american lives in the next hundred days alone if everyone wore a mask in public so let me repeat that because it's so important we can save 100 000 lives in the next 100 days according to the head of the cdc if everyone wears a mask in public so be patriotic it's not about being a tough guy it's about doing your part wearing a mask is not only going to protect you but also protects those around you your mom your dad your brother your sister husband wife neighbor co-worker don't just do it for yourself do it for the people you love the people you work with the seriousness of this virus also underscores that we need regular testing with results turned around rapidly and that's available to everyone it's not just the folks in the white house or who travel with me that deserve regular testing is folks in the meatpacking and food processing plants grocery store workers every single american deserves safety and peace of mind and it means we need transparency those who test positive need to participate and contact tracy so that everyone who they may have exposed can get tested themselves that's how you stop transmission for any epidemic it's basic we need to take the science of fighting this disease seriously if we're going to save lives and above all the news is a reminder that we as a nation need to do better in dealing with this pandemic taking these steps is how we'll protect ourselves and just as important is how we will protect one another i hope that all those who are fighting this virus including the first family and so many americans today recover and recover soon my prayers are with the families on the more than 200 i think it's seven now 207 000 americans who have died from this virus many of them got up this morning at the breakfast table with an empty chair of someone they lost and they loved we understand and there's more than seven million americans who are now infected have been infected that includes folks here in grand rapids and all across michigan especially all of you at the uf with ufcw who are on the front lines of this pandemic and on the front lines of this economic crisis ufcw workers who have always been on the front lines of fighting for dignity and respect you deserve i know it's been tough this morning september jobs report came out the last one before election day i'm grateful for all those who were able to get their jobs back to work again but there's fewer jobs than we had hoped for millions of families millions are still wondering when it will be their turn to come back from the brink and the signs according to the national press are not encouraging once again the pace of job gains is slowing down once again we're seeing temporary layoffs turn permanent this month marked the largest single month increase in long-term unemployment since we started keeping records in 1948. there are now an additional 781 000 americans who've been trying to find work at least for at least six months they've been looking to work for at least six months and haven't found it and in the past that's a sign for permanency for them we're still down 647 000 manufacturing jobs nationwide since the crisis started all told we are now 30 million workers who have either lost ours lost paychecks or lost their jobs entirely participating in the labor force participation fell last month and remained sharply down since this crisis began especially for women there's another roughly 700 000 people who've dropped out of the labor force stopped looking for a job the vast majority were women demonstrating once again how this economic crisis has been especially tough on women and families in this country this will be the first presidency in modern history to leave office with fewer jobs than when it came into office michigan has lost more than 361 thousand jobs since the beginning of 2017. in fact factories were already closing before covert like the knoll plan here in grand rapids they announced back in january they were shutting down and cutting 210 local jobs manufacturing has already slipped in a recession last year the net loss of auto manufacturing jobs you saw here in michigan and that economic pain was only amplified by the pandemic your schools and local businesses are closed like all places around america more than 26 million unemployment claims were filed by americans last month 46 million americans have exhausted their emergency savings and essential workers here in grand rapids won't forget how the ufcw members saw their jobs turn suddenly into a life and death task folks today today's report reinforces another painful trend the continuing of what economists call a k shaped recovery the k means that letter going up that's those who on the top it keeps going up well everyone else in the middle is going down and below we're seeing things get worse it means essential workers ufcw workers who sacrifice to keep us going through the pandemic and continue it are being left behind by the most unequal recovery in modern history because while workers are struggling this is a fact the top 100 billionaires in america have done pretty well just the top 100 of them they've made up more than 30 billion dollars this year the last nine months and everyone else though you get you keep hoping you get the bottom of that k-shaped recovery you get the downward slide you'll have to figure out how you're going to pay the bills and put food in the table how to balance doing your job with being a teacher to your kids because their school has gone remote you're asked to risk your neck because you can't work from home or the risks for covet are kept outside because you work at a meatpacking plan or an assembly line or at a checkout counter you know i do understand this is a scary time non-certain time i understand and i see you because i see the world from where i grew up in scranton pennsylvania a lot like grand rapids it's filled with awful lot of good people busting their neck every day doing the right thing for the families and scrant my mom used to have an expression she said not just in scranton but from the time we left there say joey nobody's better than you joey but everybody's your equal my dad's constantly refrained after he lost a job in scranton when there were no more work and he had to move to delaware he moved away for a little over a year come back every weekend to see us by the time we finally a couple years down the road in delaware gotta finally be able to buy a home my dad used to use this expression he said joey a job's about a lot more than a paycheck it's about your dignity it's about respect it's about your place in the community these are the values that shaped my growing up and i suspect most of you they shaped my whole life so i know and understood from the very beginning of consciousness about this that wall street and ceos didn't build this country the middle class built this country and unions built the middle class that's why i've laid out a comprehensive agenda not just to rebuild our communities but to make bold investments so we can build back and build back better an independent analysis actually from wall street moody's projected that my plan will create 18.6 million jobs 7 million more than the administration's economic plan and 1 trillion more in economic growth than the president's plan that's not coming from a liberal think tank that's coming from moody's here's how my plan works i'm going to raise taxes on people only making over 400 anyone making less than 400 000 a year won't pay a penny more but i'm going to ask the very big corporations the fortune 500 and the wealthy to pay their fair share for a change that means raising the corporate tax rate which was in the mid 30s and now is 21 back to 28 that means making sure that no big company gets away with paying zero taxes as 91 fortune 500 companies do today making billions of dollars zero taxes how many you pay zero taxes it means making sure the wealthiest americans don't get to pay at a lower tax rate because they're making money on their investments but they pay at the same rate that they pay for their salary these changes in the tax code will raise the money they'll allow me to invest in working people and growing the middle class which when i announced i was running i said that's the reason to rebuild the backbone of this country hard-working folks in the middle class we're going to invest in creating millions of good paying jobs union jobs and this is by the way this my plan has been thoroughly analyzed by a whole bunch of folks take infrastructure building roads bridges highways ports airports will put millions of people to work in good paying union jobs and create the foundation for growth in this country clean energy just upgrading four million buildings and weatherizing two million homes will create at least one million good paying jobs leading the world on electric vehicles and building 500 000 electric vehicle charging stations on our highways will create 1 million new auto jobs here in this state the manufacturing and technology in those areas making sure making sure the future is made in america made in michigan with good union jobs you know the federal government spends 600 billion dollars a year your tax dollars 600 billion a year to purchase everything from military equipment to steel to cars to trucks to federal fleets at 600 million billion dollars well i'm president we're going to make sure we finally make good on a commitment made a long time ago that these products all these contracts that the president united states and the federal government can award make sure those products are made by americans in america making sure that that's done it's estimated that will create 5 million new manufacturing jobs and technology jobs for small businesses we're going to make sure small businesses come out of the out on the other side of this terrible circumstance with access to capital and the ability to deal with the debts that have been accumulated during this pandemic and we'll make investments to increase incomes as well 15 minimum wage no one no one should be in a position to have to work two jobs just to get above the poverty line we're going to bring jack brack jobs from america from overseas to america direct billions of dollars in revitalization funds and competitive grants to help communities like those in western michigan compete for new business startups for our central workers we're not just going to praise you we're going to pay you a good wage to ensure you have a strong benefits we're going to ease the burden of the major costs in your life health care we'll build on the affordable care act through a new health insurance option a not-for-profit public option which will give private insurers a real competitor we'll increase subsidies for your premiums that are so they're lower so you can afford the plans with lower deductions and lower out-of-pocket expenses it will cost that plan alone will cost over 700 billion over 10 years but it's paid for by eliminating those tax cuts for a 40 year old making 50 000 a year your monthly premium will go down by a third will take on the pharmaceutical companies with a plan that slashes the cost of prescription drugs for up to 60 percent medicare will be able to negotiate prices for drugs fundamentally lowering those prices and child care a lot of you are dealing with that now how do you go to work if you have work and take care of your kids or an aging relative that's in trouble we're going to make high quality child care affordable and accessible every three and four-year-old will have access to free quality preschool we're going to make sure that low and middle income families will never have to pay more than seven percent of their income for caring for a young child an education beyond high school we're going to make sure that four-year college tuitions of a state university is tuition free for any family making less than 125 000 community college will be free and programs will be free as well if you're buying your first home you'll have a fifteen thousand dollar help to get there these are all things that people have been talking about for a while we're going to protect social security increases for millions of seniors the president's talking about giving uh eliminating the withholding tax well that's wonderful except for one thing the actuary of social security said if that plan goes through social security bankrupt by 2023 folks i promise you we can do this let me close by saying this i know i know a lot of people around here are tired of feeling overlooked and disrespected i get that the people i met this week taking a train through northeastern ohio and western pennsylvania people like the dedicated elementary school teacher from lordstown ohio whose husband when lordstown shut down accepted a transfer kentucky eight hours away each direction in order to be able to keep his health care and his pension after the gm plant closed folks who worry about health care will the affordable care act still be there for them why why they ask will i be among the 100 million americans who could lose the protections for pre-existing conditions like asthma and diabetes where once again women will be able to charge the higher premium just simply because they're a woman where insurers no longer have to allow you to be able to keep your kids on a health care plan unless 26. what will happen to your medicare benefits your social security will they still be there when you retire i'm asked many times in recent years how do we get to the place where people who stock our shelves pack our food teach our kids like my family take care of my wife take care of our sick who race in the burning buildings and pick up the garbage off our streets who did how do we get to the place where you all don't think we see you anymore or hear them and most importantly respect them that has to change i know it can i come from those neighborhoods we can get this pandemic under control so we can get our economy working again for everyone but this cannot be a partisan moment it must be an american moment we have to come together as a nation i'm running as a democrat but i am overrun and governed as an american president whether you voted for me or against me i will represent you and those who see each other as fellow americans who just don't live in red states or blue states but who live in and love the united states of america that's who we are and there's never been a single solitary thing america's been unable to do think of this not once not a single thing we've not been able to overcome when we've done it together so let's get the heck up remember who in god's name we are this is the united states of america there's nothing beyond our capacity i want to say god bless you may god protect the first family and every family is dealing with this virus and may god protect our troops thank you thank you thank you foreign,b music event

114,UZMnkq5WaSE,biden,2020-10-05T20:51:18Z,"LIVE: Biden Delivers Remarks in Little Havana in Miami, Florida",speech,good afternoon my name is esther segura i moved to miami when i was nine i'm a veteran and a single mom with two teenage daughters who i love more than anything and i am so proud to serve this community as a nurse in the jackson health system i chose to become a nurse because my grandmother was a nurse in cuba before she came to this country for a better life like my grandmother i love what i do i love helping people it's in my blood i spent eight years serving my country in the u.s army reserves as an operating room technician after my time in the military i attended nursing school here in miami and have been serving our community for 27 years today i work at jackson south and i love what i do i love my job but when covet 19 hit it hit miami hard miami became an epicenter of this virus and it was difficult for our patients but it was also difficult for my fellow health care workers and my colleagues it didn't have to be this bad i'm supporting joe for president because he has a plan and he's going to beat kobit 19. i know joe is fighting to protect the affordable care act and make sure health care is a right for everyone i know joe will look out for health care workers who are on the front lines of this pandemic i am supporting joe because i know he will be a president for working people working people made this country and deserve to have a seat at the table and that's why i joined my union sciu 1991 joe will bring us together as a country and united we can build back this country better than it's ever been i love miami we are a city of immigrants working people with many different cultures we need a president who embraces that and will fight for us miami it's my honor to introduce our next president a man who will always have our back joe [Applause] biden [Music] good afternoon everyone it's great to be back in miami and uh thank you esther i told you uh our family has been unfortunately this considerable consumer of health care please all sit down of healthcare and uh i've learned from personal experience as my sons my daughter my wife my family has learned is there any angels in heaven they're all nurses male and female docs let you live the nurses make you want to live i really mean it you're there at the tough times and by the way thank you for your service in the military but also thank you for the beginning of this pandemic being a surgical nurse wasn't easy when there wasn't the ppe available to all of you as you walked in those operating rooms and dealt with all the problems i know my son is a physician my grandma's son-in-law is a physician surgeon in philadelphia and the stories at the beginning of this process when we should have had everything available so thank you not only for your skill and your courage but for your bravery and doing what you've done i want to thank you for the care and dedication that you and all your fellow seiu members all your nurses show up and struggle with illness you're coping with the loss of a loved one in terrible times so many of you had to hold a phone to a patient's ear to say goodbye to a family member because they couldn't be there they couldn't see him in the hospital as they passed i want to thank victoria victoria for sharing her family's journey with us today victoria and i were talking a little bit earlier i was in south asia speaking with a president and he asked me what made america unique and i said immigration because it's the history of this this country and he's looked at me funny so why is that and i said because almost everybody who's come here other than those who came in chains 400 years ago beginning came because they were escaping something and it took enormous courage i really mean this think about enormous courage leave everything they knew everything that was familiar sometimes leaving family members to get in the boat and train whatever the means was to be able to leave and start a new life to do that you have to have optimism courage you have to be resilient you have to be willing to believe you can make things change for the better that's what's built this country immigration we are not figuratively it's a phrase used but not often fully appreciate a nation of immigrants that's why we're the most unique and strongest nation in the world it's family like yours and esther's that have made this country what it is through the hard work and faith and perseverance the richness and beauty of miami is built from the connections of family culture values that we share with our friends throughout the caribbean and latin america early this afternoon i visited little haiti it's been some years since i've been there when the earthquake occurred and i came to deliver some assistance to the haitian community as well as making sure we had temporary protective status granted it's a cultural complex and now here at the site named for one of cuba's most celebrated poets and thinkers this city is living proof of the incredible strength we draw from families and communities from every culture choosing america so thank you victoria for choosing us and i'm really honored that you're going to vote for me in your first election i promise you i will not let you down promise y'all let me also say at the top my prayers continue to be with the president of first lady for their health and safety as they're like so many american families are dealing with coba 19. i was glad to see the president speaking and recording videos over the weekend now that he's busy tweeting campaign messages i would ask him to do this listen to the scientists support mass support a mass mandate nationwide require masks in every federal building and facility and interstate travel urge every governor and mayor to do the same we know it saves lives his administration just rejected a masked mandate for public transportation on friday seiu came along and said we need to be protected and they said no i believe that was wrong and not very rational experts say that universal masking could save between now and january a hundred thousand lives let me say that again between now and january mandatory masking could save thousand lives you know i backed that mandate months ago he should back it now since the president entered the hospital on friday more than one hundred since friday more than 100 000 more people have been diagnosed with covet and this week at least 5 000 more will die cases and deaths are climbing in many states i hope the president's recovery is swift and successful but our nation's coveted crisis is far far from over today my prayers are with the families of the 210 000 americans who died from the virus all those families who got up this morning there was an empty chair at the breakfast table tonight an empty chair at the dinner table where one should be a husband wife son daughter mother father and nearly 7.5 million americans have been infected with the virus to date this pandemic in the economic collapse has hit the hispanic communities particularly hard nationally the infection rate among hispanics is almost three times higher than white non-hispanics more than 40 000 hispanics have died from cove in 19 devastating families and close-knit communities of loved ones and here in florida where hispanics make up about one quarter of the population they make up 37 percent of the cova deaths nearly 3 million hispanics are unemployed you break that down that that last data unemployment for hispanic women hispanic youth actually went up last month one in three hispanic small business owners have taken a hit and many are likely to have to close permanently some economists are calling this what they call a k-shaped recovery it means those at the top they keep going up their income but everyone from the middle and lower income it keeps going down keeps getting worse it means that essential workers so many of whom are hispanic who have sacrificed to keep us going through this pandemic are being left behind by the most unequal recovery in modern american history because while workers are struggling this is a shocking statistic but it's true the top 100 billionaires in america have done pretty well just since the covert crisis they have made an additional 300 billion dollars the top 100 made an additional 300 billion dollars for everyone else though they got the bottom half of that k downward the downward slide you're left to figure out how you're going to pay your bills put food in the table pay the rent or if you're lucky enough to own a home when you have enough money to pay the mortgage how to balance doing your job with being a teacher to your kids because your school has gone remote you're asked to risk your neck because you can't work from home or the risk of covet are mostly kept outside because you're one of our first responders a union nurse like esther or on an assembly line or working in a customer service or tourism industry or at a checkout counter a police officer a firefighter i know this is an easy time but i also think this pandemic has just helped us rip off the blinders in this country as how inequitable so many things are people didn't even realize until now they've seen it i truly believe we have a tremendous opportunity to turn this moment of crisis into a moment of great progress for the country that's why i've laid out a comprehensive agenda not just to rebuild our communities but to build them back make bold investments in them so we can build back better than before the crisis an independent analysis president talks about he loves talking about wall street he never talks about moody's on wall street that pointed out they did a detailed assessment of my economic plan and his and here's what moody's concluded they projected my economic plan will create 18.6 million jobs seven million more jobs in the prisons economic plan will in four years and one trillion dollars more in growth than the president's plan and here's how it works i'm not going to raise taxes on anyone who makes less than four hundred thousand dollars a year you won't pay a penny more i guarantee you but i'm going to ask the big corporations and the super wealthy to begin to fair pay their fair share it's not punishment it's just about time you start paying your fair share the money we raise from making sure they pay their fair share allow me invested in working people in a growing middle class when i announced i said i wanted to rebuild the backbone of this country working folks the middle class they weren't built by wall street it was built by labor advance racial equity across the economy to make sure everyone is included in the deal this time we're going to invest invested in creating millions of good paying jobs union jobs in manufacturing and technology making sure our future is made in america in infrastructure building roads bridges highways ports and airports like i was able to do when i ran the recovery act for our administration putting billions of dollars in the port of miami creating so good hard working people with good decent union jobs able to accommodate the new super tankers coming through the canal generating some stability my plan will make sure hispanic communities benefit from hundreds of billions of dollars in investments to fill the cracks in the sidewalks install broadband close the digital divide create spaces to live work and play and safely and clean energy we upgrade four million buildings weatherize 2 million homes will create at least the estimates are at least 1 million good paying jobs and save us millions and millions of barrels of oil we're going to meet the threat of climate change and invest in strengthening climate resilience where we are already dealing with the existential threat of climate change i don't have to tell you in miami i have to tell you in south florida or in my state which has the lowest sea level lowest degree of height from sea level than any state in the nation stronger more frequent hurricanes rising tides flooding and no matter what the president says maybe you should consider dropping an atomic weapon on a hurricane coming our way it's not a good idea it doesn't work look that's not some distant future in miami or south florida you're dealing with it right now what do you have to do get knocked in the head to understand it we're going to make sure the small businesses come out the other side of this crisis with access to capital and the ability to deal with their debts my plan will get 50 billion dollars in capital flowing to small businesses which should get repaid in employment and taxes especially minority owned small businesses and make another 100 billion dollars in low-interest loans available those businesses to get back on their feet and stay alive because you know as well as i do and nothing communities they are the heartbeat they're the center of a community whether it's a grocery store a beauty shop a barber shop the hardware store the essence of a community we're going to make investments to increase incomes as well it's long past time i've worked with governor cuomo to get it done to new york and other governors across the country no one should have to work two jobs to be able to be 40 hours a week so they're out above the poverty rate 15 should be a minimum wage in the united states america period and for our essential workers i'm not just going to praise you we're going to begin to pay you a good wage ensure you have strong benefits we're going to ease the burden of the major costs in your life what are they health care we're going to build on the affordable care act which gave 4 million hispanic people in this country health insurance by adding a new health insurance option a not for public not-for-profit public option we're going to give private insurers a real competitor we're going to increase subsidies so your premiums are lower and you can afford plans with lower deductibles and lower out-of-pocket expenses we're going to take on the pharmaceutical industry a plan that slashes the cost of prescription drugs by 60 and think i'm making these numbers up if we just let medicare negotiate independently for all the drugs they purchase i promise you the rates are going to fall through the floor affordable and accessible every three and four-year-old will have access to a free quality preschool all the studies at your great universities and all the ones around the country have shown that no matter what zip code a child comes from no matter what background if they go to preschool not daycare preschool in school at three four and five years old they increase exponentially over by over 50 percent the prospect they'll go through all 12 years and many beyond and we'll make sure that low and middle income and by the way the total cost of that is called title one program we now spend 15 15 billion dollars for in school districts that don't have high tax rates well guess what you change that to 45 you can put every one of these kids in school pay the teachers a legitimate rate and make sure you have school psychologists and social workers in those schools we're gonna make sure that for child care for someone under the age of five six no one ever has to pay more than seven percent of their income for their young children to get quality child care because if you truly want to reward work in this country we have to ease the financial burden of the care that families are carrying even before the pandemic and many of you know it and many of you are doing it millions of working families faced enormous financial and personal strains trying to raise their kids and care for their parents or loved ones living with a disability it's going to sound strange when i first got elected when i was 29 years old of the senate right after i got elected my wife and daughter were killed my two sons survived after hospitalized for a long time i needed help to do my job i could not possibly afford child care even though i was making a really good salary of 42 000 a year more than i had ever made but i couldn't afford it being a single mom or dad or a family that has two people working with young children it's incredibly costly and by the way and the professional caregivers out there home health workers child care workers who are more often women women of color and immigrants and too often underpaid unseen and undervalued that's why my buildback better plan will elevate the compensation benefits and dignity with caregivers and workers and early childhood educators that's what we're going to do it's also going to invest in education beyond high school we're going to make if you qualify to get into community college you'll automatically be able to go and you'll be able to go for free if you are qualified to go to a four-year public school in your state public college and your family makes less than 125 000 a year you get to go free if you're buying your first home you're gonna have a tax credit up to fifteen thousand dollars to get there what happened after the great recession and this one an awful lot of you were that in a range in age from the millennials who started off back in after 9 11 all the way to the people graduating this year are not in a position to do that because your jobs have been postponed or non-existent but providing an opportunity can get you into the system we're also going to protect social security increase the benefits for millions of seniors we're going to do that all in a partnership on lockstep with the hispanic community and by the way the president's proposal to eliminate the tax you pay when you get your paycheck for social security without any means by which to re replace it the actuary social security said social security will be bankrupt by 2023. they've had they've never liked it to begin with so look the success and prosperity of hispanic americans is indispensable to the success and prosperity of the united states and of all america it's that simple hispanic families are responsible today for 2.6 trillion dollars of our gross domestic product and growing if that was a standalone economy a country all by itself it would be the eighth largest economy in the world think of that now imagine how much more that would grow if everyone had access to the tools they need to succeed by investing in hispanic communities we're making the smartest possible investment with the greatest possible returns that our nation could make period you know we also need to rebuild our ability to work with our partners throughout the western hemisphere to realize the enormous potential of this region in the world to confront those leaders who continue to oppress the rights of their people we should be leading the international effort to confront the massive humanitarian crisis in venezuela maduro who i've met is a dictator plain and simple and he's causing incredible suffering among the venezuelan people to maintain his grip on power the venezuelan people need our support to recover their democracy and rebuild their country that's why i would immediately grant temporary protective status to venezuelans as president so the republicans in the senate can't keep blocking it like they did again just last week i'll make sure we're supporting neighboring countries that are being overrun with immigration because of maduro like colombia which are caring for millions of venezuelans who fled their country in desperation i'll use sanctions as one of the tools for a comprehensive strategy that includes humanitarian assistance international pressure and support for democratic actors in venezuela to force the regime to embark on the road to a free and fair election we also need a new cuba policy the administration's approach is not working cuba is no closer to freedom and democracy than it was four years ago the fact there's more political prisoners the secret police are as brutal as ever and russia is once again a major presence in cuba and havana for my entire career i stood for democracy and human rights for freedom of the press assembly and religion against dictators of the left and the right and as president my policy will be governed by two principles first americans especially cuban-americans are the best ambassadors for freedom in cuba second empowering the cuban people to determine their own future is central to a national security interest in the united states i think it's unconscionable the current administration is deporting hundreds of cubans back to a dictatorship but there are almost 10 000 cubans languishing in tent camps along the mexican border because the administration's an immigration agenda that's the administration actively separating cuban families by not processing visas through restrictions on family visits and remittances i think we have to reverse that the bottom line is that president trump cannot advance to macro democracy and human rights for the american people when he has embraced so many autocrats around the world starting with vladimir putin folks we can do this we can reach for more as a nation we can rebuild we can rebuild the backbone of this country and finally bring everybody along america has always done best coming out of crisis we're the only nation that's always come out of every crisis better than we went in we can build a new administration that reflects the full diversity of our nation including hispanic communities and hispanic voters especially in florida can help put our nation on a new path forward and here in florida today as the deadline to register to vote ends today if you haven't registered go out right now because it is an obligation every vote will make a difference check and make sure your family and friends are registered and then make sure everyone you know has a plan to vote if you can vote by mail vote by mail if you can vote in person vote in person if you can vote early vote early you can vote early in person starting on october 19th in many places in florida including right here in miami just make sure you vote together we can win we can't let this pandemic change everything we've got to get under control so we can get our economy working again for everyone we can come together as a nation i'm running as a democrat proud of it but i will be an american president not a democratic president but it's capital d i'll fight as hard for you and your family whether you vote for me or whether you vote against me because there's nothing we can't do when we do it together folks i've been more optimistic about our chances as a nation owned the 21st century and i've been my whole career there's not a single solitary thing that's beyond our capacity as a nation i mean that sincerely the most talented workers in the world the most incredible system in the world we have a people when they stand together have never ever ever ever failed so every time i'd walk out of my grandpa's house up in scranton pennsylvania he dealt joey keep the faith my grandma when she was live would yell back no joey spread it let's go spread the faith take

benefit PRON be go to ease the burden of the major cost in PRON life what be PRON health care PRON be go to build on the affordable care act which give million hispanic people in this country health insurance by add a new health insurance option a not for public not for profit public option PRON be go to give private insurer a real competitor PRON be go to increase subsidy so PRON premium be low and PRON can afford plan with low deductible and low out of pocket expense PRON be go to take on the pharmaceutical industry a plan that slash the cost of prescription drug by and think PRON be make these number up if PRON just let medicare negotiate independently for all the drug PRON purchase i promise PRON the rate be go to fall through the floor affordable and accessible every three and four year old will have access to a free quality preschool all the study at PRON great university and all the one around the country have show that no matter what zip code a child come from no matter what background if PRON go to preschool not daycare preschool in school at three four and five year old PRON increase exponentially over by over percent the prospect PRON will go through all year and many beyond and PRON will make sure that low and middle income and by the way the total cost of that be call title one program PRON now spend billion dollar for in school district that do not have high tax rate well guess what PRON change that to PRON can put every one of these kid in school pay the teacher a legitimate rate and make sure PRON have school psychologist and social worker in those school PRON be go to make sure that for child care for someone under the age of five six no one ever have to pay more than seven percent of PRON income for PRON young child to get quality child care because if PRON truly want to reward work in this country PRON have to ease the financial burden of the care that family be carry even before the pandemic and many of PRON know PRON and many of PRON be do PRON million of work family face enormous financial and personal strain try to raise PRON kid and care for PRON parent or love one live with a disability PRON be go to sound strange when i first get elect when i be year old of the senate right after i get elect PRON wife and daughter be kill PRON two son survive after hospitalize for a long time i need help to do PRON job i could not possibly afford child care even though i be make a really good salary of a year more than i have ever make but i could not afford PRON be a single mom or dad or a family that have two people work with young child PRON be incredibly costly and by the way and the professional caregiver out there home health worker child care worker who be more often woman woman of color and immigrant and too often underpaid unseen and undervalued that be why PRON buildback well plan will elevate the compensation benefit and dignity with caregiver and worker and early childhood educator that be what PRON be go to do PRON be also go to invest in education beyond high school PRON be go to make if PRON qualify to get into community college PRON will automatically be able to go and PRON will be able to go for free if PRON be qualified to go to a four year public school in PRON state public college and PRON family make less than a year PRON get to go free if PRON be buy PRON first home PRON be go to have a tax credit up to fifteen thousand dollar to get there what happen after the great recession and this one an awful lot of PRON be that in a range in age from the millennial who start off back in after all the way to the people graduate this year be not in a position to do that because PRON job have be postpone or non existent but provide an opportunity can get PRON into the system PRON be also go to protect social security increase the benefit for million of senior PRON be go to do that all in a partnership on lockstep with the hispanic community and by the way the president proposal to eliminate the tax PRON pay when PRON get PRON paycheck for social security without any mean by which to re replace PRON the actuary social security say social security will be bankrupt by PRON have have PRON have never like PRON to begin with so look the success and prosperity of hispanic americans be indispensable to the success and prosperity of the united states and of all america PRON be that simple hispanic family be responsible today for trillion dollar of PRON gross domestic product and grow if that be a standalone economy a country all by PRON PRON would be the eighth large economy in the world think of that now imagine how much more that would grow if everyone have access to the tool PRON need to succeed by invest in hispanic community PRON be make the smart possible investment with the great possible return that PRON nation could make period PRON know PRON also need to rebuild PRON ability to work with PRON partner throughout the western hemisphere to realize the enormous potential of this region in the world to confront those leader who continue to oppress the right of PRON people PRON should be lead the international effort to confront the massive humanitarian crisis in venezuela maduro who PRON have meet be a dictator plain and simple and PRON be cause incredible suffering among the venezuelan people to maintain PRON grip on power the venezuelan people need PRON support to recover PRON democracy and rebuild PRON country that be why i would immediately grant temporary protective status to venezuelans as president so the republicans in the senate can not keep block PRON like PRON do again just last week PRON will make sure PRON be support neighboring country that be be overrun with immigration because of maduro like colombia which be care for million of venezuelans who flee PRON country in desperation PRON will use sanction as one of the tool for a comprehensive strategy that include humanitarian assistance international pressure and support for democratic actor in venezuela to force the regime to embark on the road to a free and fair election PRON also need a new cuba policy the administration approach be not work cuba be no close to freedom and democracy than PRON be four year ago the fact there be more political prisoner the secret police be as brutal as ever and russia be once again a major presence in cuba and havana for PRON entire career i stand for democracy and human right for freedom of the press assembly and religion against dictator of the left and the right and as president PRON policy will be govern by two principle first americans especially cuban americans be the good ambassador for freedom in cuba second empower the cuban people to determine PRON own future be central to a national security interest in the united states i think PRON be unconscionable the current administration be deport hundred of cubans back to a dictatorship but there be almost cuban languish in tent camp along the mexican border because the administration be an immigration agenda that be the administration actively separate cuban family by not process visa through restriction on family visit and remittance i think PRON have to reverse that the bottom line be that president trump can not advance to macro democracy and human right for the american people when PRON have embrace so many autocrat around the world start with vladimir putin folk PRON can do this PRON can reach for more as a nation PRON can rebuild PRON can rebuild the backbone of this country and finally bring everybody along america have always do best come out of crisis PRON be the only nation that be always come out of every crisis better than PRON go in PRON can build a new administration that reflect the full diversity of PRON nation include hispanic community and hispanic voter especially in florida can help put PRON nation on a new path forward and here in florida today as the deadline to register to vote end today if PRON have not register go out right now because PRON be an obligation every vote will make a difference check and make sure PRON family and friend be register and then make sure everyone PRON know have a plan to vote if PRON can vote by mail vote by mail if PRON can vote in person vote in person if PRON can vote early vote early PRON can vote early in person start on october th in many place in florida include right here in miami just make sure PRON vote together PRON can win PRON can not let this pandemic change everything PRON have get to get under control so PRON can get PRON economy work again for everyone PRON can come together as a nation PRON be run as a democrat proud of PRON but i will be an american president not a democratic president but PRON be capital d PRON will fight as hard for PRON and PRON family whether PRON vote for PRON or whether PRON vote against PRON because there be nothing PRON can not do when PRON do PRON together folk PRON have be more optimistic about PRON chance as a nation own the st century and PRON have be PRON whole career there be not a single solitary thing that be beyond PRON capacity as a nation i mean that sincerely the most talented worker in the world the most incredible system in the world PRON have a people when PRON stand together have never ever ever ever fail so every time PRON would walk out of PRON grandpa house up in scranton pennsylvania PRON deal joey keep the faith PRON grandma when PRON be live would yell back no joey spread PRON let PRON go spread the faith take back this country PRON be so much well than this god bless PRON all and may god protect PRON troop thank PRON thank PRON music give baby music
115,NKbhNPHxGdI,biden,2020-10-06T20:58:17Z,FULL VIDEO: Joe Biden delivers address on national unity,speech,honor on behalf of our 550 000 men and women that we represent to endorse joe biden for president and kamala harris for vice president you're welcome vice president you know leaders stand up for what's right even when it's hard that's joe biden leaders tell the truth even when it's inconvenient that's joe biden leaders understand that the strength of our country is tied to the strength of the middle class that means strong unions protection for workers and a fair tax policy joe biden knows that joe stands with working americans and knows the value the union brings to our communities joe stands with working carpenters and because of that we're proud to stand with joe biden the next president of the united states thank you [Applause] good evening my name is james callahan i'm the general president of the operating engineers 400 members strong 400 000 members strong and it's our honor to have the next president of the united states tour our great local 66 training center that underscores what we do in labor and if we didn't have to it wasn't a far reach to explain to someone like joe biden what working americans do i want to thank jim kuntz the president and vice president of local 66 my secretary treasurer brian hickey who's flown in from chicago to underscore and relay to vice president biden that we at our general executive board wholly endorse him and senator harris for the next ticket of the president and vice president of the united states as i as joe said to us many a times he understands what a paycheck does to working people not a dividend check for people that are just waiting for a dividend check on their savings or their investment he understands that people live check to check and the guidance that go with that and the way that this administration current administration wants to tear that down so we wholeheartedly endorse as the next president of the united states joe biden thank you very much i better not touch it hello everybody it's great to be here i just want the record to show that jim promised if i get elected president united states i can go down to houston facility and work and try to drive any of this machinery i get a shot at i used to have a license to drive tractor trailers but i tell you what i'm looking to get that sucker that big caterpillar that's a good one but i'm not sure i want to try that crane man that looks awful that looks awful tough i know well i'll tell you what it's great to be here you know there was an old expression when i was growing up in scranton you go home with them that bring you to the dance and labor brought me to the dance a long long time ago they're the ones who are the operating engineers and the carpenters early on first time that i ran people who laid the tracks in the pipeline to operate the cranes and shape the skyline and build the foundations of everything we rely on labor as i said brought me to the dance not an exaggeration and the only reason i'm standing here today as a candidate for president if i hadn't been for the labor back in 1972 when i was a 29 year old kid just after labor day i was losing the election i think it was 54 to 19 going into the election and then labor came on board carpenters across the board just up and down operating engineers the steel workers and we ended up winning by a overwhelming margin of 3200 votes statewide when nixon won the state with 68 percent of the vote so i don't forget and my dad used to have an expression for real he said the only way to deal with the abuse of power joey is with power and the only people can take on the major corporate interests and the oligarchs who are abusing power the working men and women are organized labor that's not that's not an exaggeration the only ones the only ones and that's why i've been so supportive of labor my whole career i've never forgotten everything that they've done for me you've done for me but not just for me but for the country you are literally not figuratively the backbone of america the military is the spine of america you're the backbone of america an awful lot of you served in the military as well you're the ones who actually built this country not wall street bankers and ceos you built the country and you're going to build it you're going to build it back better than it was before and i want to thank uh jim i want to thank president callahan and his team as well as the folks in local 66 for welcoming here today and giving us an inside look at everything you're doing to rebuild and energize western pennsylvania i'm from eastern pennsylvania i'm from up in lackawanna county in that valley and a lot a lot's gonna happen here i'm i am so confident i really am that we're not only coming back we're going to come back big i mean i mean hard-working folks i want to thank vice president frank spencer and the carpenters for all they do as well i'm honored to trust your place to man i want to thank you a lot for it and if i have the honor becoming president i'll be fighting for you every single day and i promise you hear me now you will have a seat at the table at the white house no fundamental decisions will be made without you sitting in literally not figuratively literally that's a word you have my word on it and folks you know i've i've been on a train today i've traveled just kind of like going back home i i traveled over 2 million 100 000 miles over 40 years on amtrak going back and forth every single solitary night to see my kids a 250 mile round trip but we came today we ran around an amtrak train to do a whistle-stop tour we started off in cleveland across ohio and went to western pennsylvania and riding the rails uh reminds me of when i would take the train home from wilmington to washington and back every night and i used to go back when you get through beyond the beltway going into baltimore you go through a number of middle-class neighborhoods like houses like like i grew up in three-bedroom split-level homes that kind of thing and i used to literally when we have debates on the floor of the senate i'd look out that window and i'd sit there and i'd see the lights on and the homes were passing just like we saw coming from cleveland into pittsburgh and pittsburgh to here and i'd wonder do they have the same kind of conversations at that table that my mom and dad had at our table are they having the same kind of conversations the guys i grew up with and women i grew up with dad no honey we can't get four new tires in the car we can't we can't afford it we got to wait another month literally not figuratively literally or you know i know i you know i i know we need a new hot water heater but we can't afford it we got to wait it's going to take a little while longer you have a vast majority of the middle class saying before we got into this recession that if they got a bill for for an unexpected bill for 400 in a month that they didn't expect that you have to borrow the money or put it off they're neighbors i grew up in and you're the only ones that have saved them from people from having to do that if in fact you're able to have work you know folks i knew all those families inside and those families and on that route today i didn't know their names but i know what was on their minds and what their concerns were they're not looking for a handout all they're looking for is a hand up my dad used to say joe i don't expect the government to solve my problems but i sure didn't expect them to understand my problem we're not understanding the problems of the vast majority of americans today all they're looking for is a fair shot and a little bit of dignity and a little bit of respect instead of being looked down on so that the parents could look their kids in the eye and say honey everything's going to be okay my dad just had that expression and jobs a lot after we left scranton and he had to move to delaware and commute every day for over a year and then finally be able to get us down not every day once a week come back every week and finally we got to go to we got apartment and climb on delaware a little still town has no more steel now but and then we finally ever get a home four years later but you know it's um it's what a lot of people are still going through there's a stark difference from what i saw last night on the debate stage an entitled self-serving president who inherited everything in his life and squandered it a president who calls his own supporters according to some staff members his own supporters disgusting who thinks that folks who put their lives on in line for our country in the military are losers and suckers it's despicable i've dealt with guys like trump my whole life the guys who might let you park the cars at their country club pick up a few bucks but even if you had the money wouldn't let you join that country club because you're religion or because of your background guys who stiff contractors building their hotels and their golf courses just to put a few more bucks in their pocket and seem to take some joy in it guys who think the rules don't apply to them guys who make tens of millions of dollars and pay 750 dollars in federal taxes in a year donald trump sees things from park avenue i see him from where i grew up in scranton and clemont my mom gene finnegan biden had a backbone like a ramrod all five foot one of her but my mom used to have an expression i really mean it i used to be a stutterer and it's when you're a stutter you're used to bullies it's easy to make fun of somebody who talks like that that's how i learned to fight the joke used to be brides like shoe leather you can beat him but he's going to hurt you because you have to stand up to these folks well my mom would say joey look at me look at me remember nobody is better than you nobody but everybody's your equal and she meant it she meant it as i said you know my dad's expression when we moved to delaware so you talk about how a job is a lot more than about a paycheck it's about your dignity it's about respect it's about your place in the community those values shaped my whole life if you look back on my career you notice it shaped my whole career my build back better plan it shaped my views as president what i'll do it's all about giving communities like greensburg and new alexandria and claymont and scranton and places in parts of cleveland i just came out of given women and men who work on pipelines and construction sites a fair shot we're going to invest two trillion dollars in infrastructure including more than 50 billion in one year to get to repairing our schools our highways our bridges revitalizing our locks and our dams making our inland waterways the finest in the world that's what attracts businesses that's what brings employment they talk about how much my plan cost well guess what those investments are going to create millions of high-paying jobs building a modern infrastructure and a durable energy future i promise you this in my administration collective bargaining now hear me collective bargaining will be sacred it's a guarantee a guarantee and union apprenticeships union apprenticeships will be sacred the last thing we need is corporate america taking over apprenticeships programs like they tried to do we're going to stand up for prevailing wage and benefit predictions of the davis-bacon act i had a guarantee you may recall the president who used to like to surprise me at state of the union addresses says and sheriff joe will take care of the bill back and we didn't call bill back better as a recovery act 800 billion dollars not a single project was not prevailing wage as a guarantee every single solitary project we built and so folks we're going to level the playing field for you and for your families we're going to have wages and benefits we're going to lower healthcare costs prescription drug prices we're going to take on the opioid crisis for real with effective treatment making four years of public college universities apprentice programs tuition-free anybody making less than 125 000 a year if they go to a state university they go to a community college it's automatic if they're an apprentice program it's going to be free my wife has an expression she's a community college professor any country that out educates us will out-compete us and the cost is staggering for people having to carry the burden and we're going to do without asking anyone who makes under 400 000 a year to pay one more penny in taxes guarantee my word on it because what we're going to do we're going to get rid of that god-awful 2 trillion dollar tax cut that trump passed 1.4 trillion going to the top 1 significant portion that going the top 1 10th of one percent we're going to start rewarding work not wealth we're going to make sure corporations begin to pay their free you know the fortune 500 companies 91 don't pay a single penny in taxes and some of them make multi-billion dollars how about your taxes you pay no nothing in taxes we're not going to punish anybody everyone's going to pay their fair share look a lot of people around here voted for donald trump last time i get it i understand why i've been asked many times in recent years how do we get to a place where the people who teach our kids take care of our sick build our bridges operate our cranes who race into burning buildings and don't ask who's in the other in there whether you're black or white or muslim or christian people who who in fact grow our food how do we get to a place where they don't think we don't see them or hear them or respect them well i see them i hear them i respect them i know them they're family and it's going to change it's going to change with me look this is not a partisan moment this is an american moment and i mean that seriously think about it we have a chance to put the anger and division has overtaken this country behind us we can be what we are at our best one people one america we just need to remember who in god's name we are this is the united states of america think about this never once in our history when we've set our mind to it have we not been able to accomplish whatever we set our mind to when we've done it together there's not a single thing we can't do and with your help i'm going to get elected and with us working together i promise you i promise you there's going to be a different america we again reward work not just wealth where people are treated with i'll decency by saying a president's words matter no matter how good or bad a president is the words they utter matter they can take us to war they can bring peace it can make the market rise or fall it can change people's lives this president has hate and division under the rocks here hate only hides it doesn't go away and it matters what presidents say you heard he said last night when he was asked by the moderator when you condemn white supremacy and he fuddled around didn't say anything i said how about the proud boys and he said well in context of lexi said just tell them to stand down and stand by go online look at problems they've got a new emblem now literally it says stand down and stand by implying that if he loses the election something may have to be done i promise you that won't happen the american people are going to speak they're going to speak in large numbers and nobody is going to get in the way of our democratic process going forward nobody period this is the united states of america we're not some tin horn dictatorship or a third world country it's the united states of america so i want to thank you all for your endorsements i really mean it it means a lot to me personally just on a personal level i appreciate it so god bless you all and may god protect our troops thank you so very much [Music] and brother,b honor on behalf of PRON man and woman that PRON represent to endorse joe biden for president and kamala harris for vice president PRON be welcome

families came here looking for their opportunities i was lucky to graduate college get married and raise our beautiful son michael michael is now 13 years old fighting a pre-existing condition called brittle bones disease it is thanks to the obama biden administration and their work to pass the affordable care act that my son can't be denied medical care because of his pre-existing condition i vote democrats because they fight for people like my son and their right to quality affordable healthcare the last few months have been have not been easy either we all know how the corona virus has hurt workers here in las vegas before this pandemic i work five different jobs as a banquet server all five of those jobs are offline now it's clear to me that donald trump has failed to do what is necessary to protect americans from the health and economic impact of this virus i am lucky but i still have a job and medical insurance for my family but what about those who aren't so lucky what happens to them who is looking out for them and their families that's why we need joe biden someone who like us grew in a working-class community not on park avenue joe cares about us he'll fight for us yes times are tough but like joe biden one word describes the spirit of nevada resilience with joe biden as our next president we are going to move past the darkness of the last four years onto a

recession you in your case all hundreds still had to work two jobs now it's one you're just trying to do right by your family just like so many people across the country i just left east las vegas community center with assemblyman edgar flores son of mexican immigrants i got to talk to his dad he got to swear at his dad as a united states citizen last week [Music] he became a lawyer to fight for the rights of immigrants he made sure that he met with the i met with a group of latino leaders who fight for respect and dignity that we're all entitled to no matter who we are or where we're from yesterday i was with kamal harris in arizona after her outstanding debate performance i couldn't be prouder of running alongside her she's always looking out for the people for you you know we we took a tour through phoenix we met with the workers and small business owners and tribal leaders remember cindy mccain john mccain's wife a widow and a dear friend of an american hero john mccain we also saw the resilience and the goodness and decency of the american people they're not looking for a handout they just want a fair shot my dad used to have an expression when he lost his job up in scranton when i was in grade school my dad would say and i we had to move in with my grandparents when he went down south from scranton to wilmington delaware looking for a job and he used to always say that you know the fact is joey i'm not looking for government to solve my problems i hope in hell i can at least understand my problems he finally got a job we could afford to buy a small home he worked hard to build a decent middle class life it wasn't easy for him but he had an expression as i said a job joey is about a lot more than a paycheck it's about your dignity it's about respect it's about your place in the community just being able to look your kid in the eye and say honey it's going to be okay you deserve a president who understands what you're going through who sees you where you are and where you want to be the last thing you need is a president who ignores you looks down upon you who just doesn't understand who in god's name we are that's president trump his reckless personal conduct since his diagnosis the stabilizing effect it's having on our government is unconscionable he didn't take the necessary precautions to protect himself or others and the longer donald trump is president the more reckless he gets how can we trust him to protect this country governor you've seen how he picks fights with states and piss them against one another look what's happened more than 210 000 americans are dead 420 000 have been hospitalized we lose anywhere from 700 to 1000 people every single day in america worse than any country in the world more than 7.5 million americans have been affected and we're still counting and here in nevada have been more than 82 000 cases in total more than 1 600 deaths 80 percent of those deaths have been seniors over 60 years of age black latino asian americans and native american communities are especially hit hard nationally the affection rate among latinos is almost three times higher than that of white non-latinos and the death rate as well is three times higher more than forty thousand latinos have died from trove of nineteen my heart goes out to all those families we got up this morning there was an empty chair around the kitchen table i'll go to dinner tonight and the person that should be there is gone you know they've lost part of their soul and lost part of their life it's all about family with you and i it's all about family losing family is a devastating thing we can do so much better my heart goes out to everyone struggling with the economic crisis caused by the neglect the simple neglect of this president nearly 11 million jobs lost since the beginning of this crisis and they still haven't come back including 136 000 jobs here in nevada temporary layoffs have turned to permanent layoffs record growth last month and the number of americans facing long-term unemployment and the problem with long-term unemployment once you get beyond a certain point history shows us that they never get a job again all told there are now 30 million workers who either lost hours lost paychecks or lost their jobs entirely roughly 700 000 people have dropped out of the labor force last month and the vast majority were women we're still down 647 000 manufacturing jobs nationwide since the crisis has started and our balance of payment steps that are going up and here in nevada the unemployment rate is 13.2 percent the highest in the nation because of president trump's negligence the hospitality industry been hit particularly hard the culinary union has recently said publicly that 50 percent of their members are still out of work tourism in june was down 70 percent from a year ago the result president trump will be the first president in modern history since hoover to leave office with fewer jobs than he had when he came into office here in nevada after seeing over two hundred thousand jobs created in the last seven years of the biden obama biden administration nevada has actually seen jobs go down under the trump presidency he's leaving us with he calls he says it's a v-shaped recession it's a k-shaped recession where those at the top keep going up in the middle class and everyone else keeps going down getting worse it means essential workers who sacrifice to keep us going through this pandemic are being left behind by the most unequal recovery in modern history you get this the top 100 billionaires in america have done pretty well just in the pandemic the top 100 billionaires have made an additional 300 billion dollars top 100 but you get the bottom half of that k and it's a downward slide you'll have to figure out how you're going to pay your bills put food on the table so much food insecurity in america in this state how to balance doing your job with being a teacher for your kids because because of the negligence of the president they can't go back to school because they haven't provided the wherewithal for schools to open you're asked to risk your neck because you can't work from home or the risk of covet are kept outside that's because you're a police officer a firefighter a nurse or you work on an assembly line in customer service or a checkout counter or here in vegas in hospitality if you're a housekeeper a casino worker built the ones who built this very stage governor sisalak your members of congress are doing everything they possibly can to help turn things around governor you've been focused and responsible you followed science to put public health and safety first you've made tough calls that save lives working around the clock so we can reopen schools in the economy safely your members of congress have done the same [Music] and the house passed what they call the heroes act months ago would have provided billions of dollars to help states keep first responders on the job the safety measures needed the ppp needed to open our schools and businesses but donald trump and mitch mcconnell republican leader did nothing to move the legislation nothing in june nothing in july nothing in august nothing in september things getting worse and worse and worse and as people struggled and suffered what do they focus on if this wasn't so serious you think i'm making it up what they focused on is more tax cuts for the wealthy not a joke the proposal is another 30 billion dollar tax cut for millionaires and billionaires cuts in funding cutting the means by which we fund the social security system leading the actuary of social security say if they do it by 2023 mid-2023 there'll be no money for social security and a relentless effort to eliminate as alejandro said the affordable care act which provides health care coverage for 22 million people one over 100 million with pre-existing conditions this is going on at the same time he's already cost 10 million people their health insurance because their companies have gone bankrupt it's unconscionable instead of focusing on our needs your needs he's trying to make take your health care away he's literally before the supreme court as i speak to strike down the entire affordable care act take away that health care for 20 million americans that's 282 thousand nevadans take away federal protections for pre-existing conditions 1.2 million nevadans and complications from covet like lung scarring and heart damage could well become the next pre-existing condition striking down the affordable care act would toss out the rule that allows our children to be covered on their parents insurance policy until age 26 take us backward when insurance companies could change charge a woman more for health care than a man for the same procedure just because she's a woman take away medicare benefits for seniors increase their drug protection their drug prescription costs and just as he vowed to quote terminate as i said earlier the funding for social security the idea that in just a few years could put at risk 410 000 nevada's rely on a dignified retirement because of social security and all this during all this not once did president trump call a high-level meeting of democrats and republicans to the white house to resolve these issues i've served with a lot of presidents never no matter good or bad you thought they were do they fail to try to bring parties together in the white house to reach a settlement you know why he spent so much time hiding in the bunker in the white house or on the bunker of his golf course playing hundreds of rounds of golf and then this tuesday what'd he do he said end the discussions he wasn't even started no more negotiations no more negotiations and now today says well i'm back one thing for sure donald trump shows no urgency to deliver hardworking americans like the family i grew up in like all of you what they need now desperately for exactly two months since the emergency small business program your congress people voted for has closed down two months of small business owners in nevada and across the country waiting hoping for just a little extra help to be able to stay open now we have more than four hundred thousand small businesses have been permanently closed by the way the largest employers in america are small businesses millions more are struggling to hang on how many more will go under how many more dreams will be extinguished because of the selfishness of this president of republican leaders in congress make no mistake if you're out of work if your business is closed if your child's school is shut down if you're facing eviction as millions are over 20 million americans worry about whether they're going to be able to pay their mortgage next month none of that seems to matter to donald trump you're a firefighter police officer who depends on state and local budgets he's turned his back on you as well because they've got to balance their budgets they're being laid off all over america when brock and i were elected we inherited the worst recession short of the great depression in history he put me in charge of what's called the recovery act 800 billion dollars we passed and needed to get out into the economy within 18 months to prevent a depression we did it with less than two-tenths of percent of waste or fraud and i was able to see to it to the states in order to keep moving keep teachers firefighters first responders all employed i was able to get 140 billion dollars in aid out to the states right here in clark county i was able to bring two 1.2 billion dollars to keep your economy going we have that ability now the house has already passed a similar piece of legislation and we started the longest sustained recovery in american history but you know what mitch mcconnell said about helping the states i'm not making this up he said let them go bankrupt let them go bankrupt what in the hell is he talking about folks we're so much better than this we can turn this crisis into progress we can contain this virus and fully reopen our economy we make up four percent of the world's population and we have 20 percent of the world's deaths if we just follow the science expand testing and tracing social disease washing our hands implementing nationwide mass mandates don't politicize the race for a vaccine mr president just have a plan for a safe and equitable distribution on economy bring the congress back together to pass real relief to help people who've lost their unemployment checks as well and then implement a comprehensive agenda that i've laid out to make bold investments so we can build back better you know he keeps talking about the republicans some republicans keep a lot of them are acknowledging and supporting me but a lot of them also are talking about well biden's going to spend all this money well guess what the independent analysis put out by moody's on a wall street firm did a detailed analysis of my recovery plan in the presidents and here's what they said it's off of wall street that my plan will create 18 18.6 million jobs in four years seven million more jobs in the president's plan [Music] and one trillion dollars more in economic growth than the president's plan [Music] democrats know how to get things done here's how my plan works it's not going to raise a penny in tax for anyone making less than four hundred thousand dollars a year not a penny and how i'm gonna pay for all this i'm gonna ask the big corporations and the wealthy to start paying their fair share you realize that the forcing 500 companies 92 of them making billions of dollars don't pay a single penny in taxes it's wrong [Music] donald trump paying 720 dollars in taxes come on the money we raise by eliminating the 1.3 trillion of his 2 trillion tax cut that affects the super wealthy and corporations we're going to invest in working people we're going to grow the middle class to make sure everyone's included on the deal the kinds of investment that will stimulate the economy including industries like tourism and hospitality to get back to full employment fast and help build back better than before it means the analysis shows creating millions of good paying union jobs manufacturing and technology making sure our future is made in america we the president in the white house gives out 600 billion dollars in contracts per year well guess what when i'm president it's going to go to no outfit that doesn't make it in america the whole thing and sell it in america i mean it and infrastructure building roads bridges highways ports airports and clean energy upgrading four million buildings and weatherizing two million homes creating at least at least a million good paying jobs in the process making the climate safer saving hundreds of millions of barrels of oil we'll deal with climate change by creating millions of union jobs that build the climate resilience of our cities and our towns fighting back stronger more frequent wildfires beating heatwaves droughts hurricanes and floods by the way did you hear what the president said about hurricanes this summer he was told about how they're coming across the warm water in the in atlantic and if they get to the the closer they get to the shore the more worse they get nobody said helerando alejandro he said maybe we should drop an atomic weapon on them and blow them up as we say in my religion bless me father for i have sinned what's going on here under my plan small business come out the other side of this crisis with access to capital and the ability to deal with their debts we're going to get 50 billion dollars in new capital especially for minority owned businesses and small businesses we're going to make another 100 billion dollars in low-interest loans available to these businesses creating jobs increasing economic growth and increasing incomes a fifteen million dollar fifteen thousand dollar fifteen dollar minimum wage i'm dreaming here but a 15 minimum wage for our central workers we're not just going to praise you we're going to pay you for the good wage and sure you have strong benefits we'll ease the burden of the major cost in your life will bully affordable care act writing new health insurance options not-for-profit public options which give private insurers a real competitor we're going to increase subsidies for premiums and lower your costs increase plans that will lower deductibles and lower out-of-pocket expenses and we're going to take on the pharmaceutical industry with a plan that will slash cost the prescription drugs by 50 percent reason i'm not going to more detail you matter a long time let's give me one example if in fact medicare is able to negotiate for all the drugs they buy and say you're not going to be able to sell them to unless you pay the price we're just suggesting that would drop by 60 percent the cost the cost of drugs we'll also make high quality child care available accessible we'll work with the states to ensure that every three four year old will get access to free high quality preschool not not not daycare we're going to make sure low middle-income families never have to spend more than seven percent of their income to care for young children because if we truly want to reward work in this country we have to ease the financial burdens and create the care for families that are caring for raising a child and an aging loved one look and the professional caregivers out there home health care workers child care workers we're off with more often women women of color immigrants are too often underpaid under seen and undervalued that's why my build back better plan will elevate the compensation benefits and dignity of caring caregiving workers and early childhood educators we're also going to triple the funding for title one schools like the one behind me here which serve high number of children from low-income families we're going to make four years of public college and universities tuition free for any family that makes less than 125 thousand 000 a year we're going to make community college and job training programs free for all hard-working americans that qualify and if you're buying your first home we're going to provide a 15 000 tax credit to help you get there we're going to protect social security increased benefits for millions of seniors look i'm not going to lay it out but go to joebiden.com go to moody's look it up we pay for all this and we grow the economy at the same time the fact is president united states can only see the world from park avenue he thinks wall street built this country and ceos i see the world from where i grew up in scranton pennsylvania and claymont communities like some that you live in i know the middle class working people built this country the measure of economic success is by what our families are talking about around the kitchen table are you able to look your kid in the eye and say honey it's going to be okay how many times do you know somebody this morning had to say i know look i know those those tires are bald but you got to ride on them for another 20 000 miles we just don't have the money we just can't do it now who's gonna tell her she can't go back to school because we can't continue to borrow the money to keep her in that community college there's a discussion that took place around my table and i'm sure yours as well but if we're going to get anything done we've got to come together i made a speech i worked really really hard on and thought really hard about before i made it in gettysburg pennsylvania on the battlefield last week i said at that time that we're facing a crisis not unlike we did after gettysburg i said there that i'm running as a proud democrat but i'm going to govern as an american president [Music] i'm going to work as hard for those who don't support me as those who do because after all this country has been through after all that america has accomplished after all the years we've stood as a beacon of light to the world we cannot be we cannot be that here and now in 2020 we allow the government the government of the people by the people and for the people to perish from this earth folks we have it in our hands and i mean this in the bottom of my heart we have in our hands the ultimate power what's the ultimate power in the democracy the power to vote here in nevada the best thing you can do is vote early and return your ballot quickly ballot share in clark county were mailed two days ago on wednesday you can return your ballot by mail you can drop it off at a drop box or vote in person during the early vote or on election day but just make a plan seriously go to iwillvote.com nv make a plan don't risk any delays return that mail-in ballot as soon as you can make sure your voice is heard we can be better than what we've seen we can be what we are at our best the united states of america i'm confident we can bring democrats and republicans together again with him gone folks conclude by saying there has never ever ever been anything the united states but it's unable to accomplish when we've done it together never never never so folks let's stand up and vote and take back this country now thank you thank you thank you thank you appreciate it [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] is [Music] you,b stage four clear blast almost a matter of month personally for PRON

PRON child to be cover on PRON parent insurance policy until age take PRON backward when insurance company could change charge a woman more for health care than a man for the same procedure just because PRON be a woman take away medicare benefit for senior increase PRON drug protection PRON drug prescription cost and just as PRON vow to quote terminate as i say earlier the funding for social security the idea that in just a few year could put at risk nevada rely on a dignified retirement because of social security and all this during all this not once do president trump call a high level

124,5iCeLlyYWf0,biden,2020-10-10T21:33:38Z,Live: Biden Holds Campaign Event In Pennsylvania  | NBC News,speech,of donald trump and dan laughlin see joe biden and i we're in this fight for the same reasons we want to level the playing field for working families to be able to succeed and ensure everyone has access to quality health care and education and rebuild the middle class with good paying union jobs thank you it's that simple it's leadership that looks out for everyone not just the top one percent and at times like these we see firsthand why leadership matters we are facing an unprecedented health crisis and republicans my opponent included they want to strip health care from families i mean cobit will be the next pre-existing condition and yet even with a hundred and seventy four thousand pennsylvanians having contracted covid trump and republicans they want to go back to a time where people could be charged or deny coverage for pre-existing conditions we can't afford four more years of trump we can't afford former years of laughlin and we can't afford four more years of this politics as usual that's why i'm so excited to vote for joe biden this year joe being here today it really shows that he's not taking a single vote in pennsylvania for granted and as president he'll fight every single day for every single pennsylvanian and make sure families get a fair shot joe has never never forgotten where he's come from his pennsylvania roots have shaped his values and guided his career they're the reason he's fought so hard for union workers and working families and as a senator as and as a vice president and they're the values he'll take with him to the white house when he serves as president for all americans in every town big and small like joe i will never forget where i came from either i grew up right here on blue collar family roots on the east side of town a granddaughter of union members working families deserve leadership that is all about public service not politics when you send me to the state senate and when you send joe to the white house we'll fight like hell every single day for erie county from fairview to northeast from mccain to the city of erie you and we all here deserve a champion in harrisburg and one in the president in the white house that will fight for us as well both of us will do the same fighting for erie county every single day it is with the highest honor to be here today and be here with you as we elect and honor our next president joe biden he's the fighter that we need in the white house and the only way we'll build erie back better now on november 3rd we have a once in a generation opportunity to flip the state senate and take back the white house that path runs right through erie so let's show future president biden what erie is made of onward to victory thank you please welcome a journey worker and recent graduate of the ua local 27 apprenticeship program joel hobson good afternoon my name is joel i'm a journeyman plumber and a recent ua local 27 apprenticeship graduate after work in plumbing for five years i decided to take the leap to further my career in the field and get involved with ua local 27 my life has only approved ever since five years later i'm able to support my community every day while working with the union who supports me my wife stephanie and my two kids quinn and beckett i get to feel the dignity that goes along with finishing a hard day's work it matters when i tuck my kids in at night that they see that i'm proud of what i do i don't know where i would be without plumbers local 27 but even though plumbers local 27 has been so helpful to me and my family unions like mine are facing an uphill climb today the republicans led by president trump have gone to war against unions they have made every effort to weaken the voice of labor and given breaks to wealthy corporations and ceos that don't need any help if we elect donald trump we will continue to face these kinds of attacks that means the next person to face struggles like i was may not be able to lift themselves up by joining a union when unions are threatened the american middle class is threatened now more than ever we need joe biden because he'll support unions and the apprenticeship programs they provide that way everyone no matter if they went to college or not can get a good paying job with benefits that can support their family out here in erie county we know that joe gets us he grew up on the other side of the state but he grew up in a working class family just like mine joe knows that the middle class built this country and that we can build it back better but to do that we need a president who ensures that workers are treated with dignity and earn the pay benefits and workplace protection that they deserve i'm excited to be here today with a man who believes in the dignity of work who believes that a strong middle class is something worth fighting for i hope that everyone who shares their beliefs will join me in voting for joe biden and kamala harris in the election this year thank you [Applause] please welcome a local soybean farmer rick tellez good afternoon my name is rick tellis i am a third generation farmer right here in western pennsylvania back in 2016 i voted for donald trump on the campaign trail four years ago he made tons of promises promises to the working man to the middle class and as he traveled around the country he promised to bring back manufacturing jobs and to fix the economy promote the use of ethanol for farmers it did not take long for me to realize that president trump was nothing more than a con man he sold me and others on ideas that he was going to change things in washington you've heard it drain the swamp make america great for the working man people like myself who felt ignored and underappreciated by our national leaders one of the first things he did that had an impact on thousands of farmers like myself was the start of the trade war with china it was a double whammy the added cost of the inputs due to the tariffs compounded with the effects of what china put on the commodity prices what the press has known mostly talked about soybeans those two have added up to sometimes as much as a 40 percent effect on my on my economy on the farm you know trump referred to farmers as being true patriots well he bought us off with huge subsidies but his policies had already caused tremendous harm to the farming communities and farms across america well it's because that i am a patriot that i'm loudly speaking out against trump and his administration when people ask me why i no longer support him i tell him the list is too long you know the unnecessary trade issues were just the start of the tip of the iceberg the trade war it affected every person in america whether they knew it or not his threats to the affordable care act will impact millions is pushed to eliminate payroll taxes that's funding for social security when people need that safety net the most now don't even get me started on his total disregard for the constitution the values that held this country together for centuries some of you may have seen an ad in which i told held president trump totally accountable and negligent for how he informed the people and misinformed us about the pandemic that ad was aired that ad was made three weeks prior to being aired and when it was aired it was aired on the same day that paul woodruff's book came out and the release of the voice recordings from trump saying he knew how serious this virus was in february and when choosing not to tell the american people i felt so vindicated about making that ad when i heard that recording this guy claims to be pro-life but his negligence helped to lead more than 210 000 people to an early death from the canonical virus he put hundreds of thousands of lives at risk for nothing more than the pure profits of wall street donald trump he is not pro-life he is pure pro-profit always has been our lives and wellness have always been like nothing more than a game to him and we deserve so much more out of a commander-in-chief so why am i supporting and speaking out in favor of vice president joe biden it's pretty simple when i listen to joe i think of my kids and my grandkids i think of the future i want for them the america i want to them to inherit i know that when joe biden becomes president he'll work hard to build a country that works for everybody he'll make sure that the communities have opportunities to succeed and set the next generation up with the tools and resources they'll need to thrive they'll be a leader we can trust and believe one who will fight for our children like as if they were his own and that is why i am honored and proud to introduce the next president of the united states joe biden [Applause] [Applause] hello hello hello hello thank you thank you thank you it's good to be back in erie i want to say hello to all eerie but mainly mr mayor city council president horton and all local elected leaders for joining us here today and to your next senator julie uh we need to turn out and support for democrats down the line here in pennsylvania to win back that pennsylvania state senate folks uh look i want to thank you president mcmanus for coming out you've been a good friend a long time and for everyone at the ua for hosting this incredible training facility and uh you know it's i'm so grateful to have earned ua's endorsement you have over 355 proud plumbers pipefitters and more behind me than uh than i can possibly thank you for i also want to thank rick for sharing his story this today you know uh uh and for being part of a conversation this year where he shared his story with america and uh rick uh delaware is thought of being a great uh uh corporate entity and uh chemical facilities and all those things but we have a four billion dollar as you probably well know agricultural industry in the delmarva peninsula it's a big deal a lot of farmers are being hurt really badly really badly farmers all across the country been gutted by the president's broken promises and reckless trade war and but our farmers just like our union members and anyone who actually does an honest day's work see him and his promises for what they are rick i want to thank you and i think you put a best uh in the op-ed you wrote last year with uh you said it's a bunch of hot air and cold wind folks this is it the election's here the choice couldn't be more stark the stakes couldn't be higher so many pennsylvanians are facing hard times right now after my debate in cleveland last week i took a train which i've ridden a lot at amtrak training north from northeast northeastern ohio into pittsburgh and greensburg latrobe and johnstown and i heard the same stories everywhere i've been hearing all around the country you're trying your best but it never feels like enough you're not looking for a handout you're just looking for a fair shot that's how my dad felt when we had to leave scranton after there was no work when cole died he was in sales he wasn't a guy who was in the coal mines although my my great grandfather was a uh i get they tell me the first irish catholic state senator ever elected in the state of pennsylvania and he was a mining engineer but i i remember him saying he made that walk which a lot of you know here in erie i call it the longest walk any parent has to make up a short flight of stairs to tell his kids we can't play in that ball can't play in greenwich little league anymore you can't go to saint paul's you got to leave dad doesn't have a job i'm going to have to leave i remember him taking me home us home my mom and and three children at the time home to my grandpop's and took on how much pride it must have cost him to ask my grandfather to take care when you take care of gene and the kids i'll be back and he started commuting every weekend 157 miles down to delaware where he had grown up we ended up in a still town called clemont delaware then we went to wilmington my dad got a sales job and he worked hard took about four years to build a decent middle-class life and be able to buy a home but it wasn't easy for him but he had an expression he said joey i don't expect the government to solve my problems but i at least expect them to understand my problems america deserves a president who understands what people are going through you're facing real challenges right now and the last thing you need is a president who exacerbates them more than 210 000 are dead as was pointed out we lose anywhere from 700 to 1000 people a day dead the president was told a little while ago when he was told a hundred thousand people a day were dying you know what he said he says it is what it is well it is what it is because he is who he is more than 7.5 million americans have been affected infected and counting 175 cases 75 000 cases right here in pennsylvania my heart goes out to all those families who like when any of us have lost a child spirit look at that empty chair and dining room table tonight where somebody you love used to sit my heart goes out to everyone struggling in this economic crisis simple neglect on the part of this administration nearly 11 million jobs lost since the beginning of this crisis and still have not come back temporary layoffs have turned into permanent layoffs we're still down 674 000 manufacturing jobs nationwide since the crisis started and more than 40 000 manufacturing jobs here in pennsylvania the trump presidency will be the first presidency since since hoover that is going to end up leaving office with fewer jobs than when he came into office since hoover president trump is leaving he talks about this v recovery like we went down real quick we're coming up quick well he asked what you call a case shape recovery those folks on the top of the care are doing very very well the recession of the top those folks everything's going up for them but everybody in the middle and below is going down seeing things get worse it means essential workers who sacrificed to keep us going through this pandemic are being left behind by the most unequal recovery in american history and it means while the top this is a fact which is startling to me when i found it out the top 100 billionaires in the middle of this pandemic they made 300 billion additional dollars hear me now 100 individuals made one three hundred billion dollars this year and what'd the bottom half get they got the k they got the slide down because the fact is the president can only see the world from park avenue i see it from scranton i see it from claymont for real you all know what i'm talking about you all see it from eerie that's why my program to build back better is focused on working people think about it think about all the people you know who got up this morning and had the following conversation you know honey i know we need four new tires they're bald but we can't do it now we got to wait you got to wait you know what i know i know we just lost our insurance but we're gonna we're gonna be okay we're gonna we're gonna hang in there or you know having to make a choice literally a choice between getting the prescription or putting food on the table if i said to that ten years ago you'd look at me like i was writing a fiction story but that's the truth they're the decisions people are making today right now independent analysis put out by a highly respected wall street firm of all things moody's from a wall street firm projects that my build back better plan is going to create 18.6 million jobs in four years that's harder now that's not that's not a liberal think tank that's moody's and it's going to create seven million more jobs than the president's economic plan and a trillion dollars more in economic growth than the president's plan and here's how it works i'm going to raise taxes i'm not going to raise taxes on anybody making less than 400 grand but but you won't pay a penny more but those making more than that i'm going to ask them to finally begin to pay the fair share i'm going to ask the big corporations and the wealthy to begin to pay 91 of the fortune 500 companies today pay zero tax you hear me zero tax how many of you pay zero tax and billionaires are paying at a tax rate because of all investment money they're paying a lower tax rate than you pay if you have a job as a plumber how can that be so i'm going to raise the money i'm going to raise we're going to allow us to invest in working people and grow the middle class back and make sure everyone comes along this time my plan is about making the kinds of investments that are going to stimulate economic growth to get it back to full employment fast and help us build back better than before we're going to create millions of good paying union jobs i had the honor of being the guy in charge of the recovery act when the great recession occurred the president turned to me he used to love doing it at state of the union messages he never told me what he's going to do and he turns says and joe sheriff joe's going to take care of that 800 billion dollars well we got it we got it done less than two tenths of one percent waster fraud and we built back the longest expansion in american history manufacturing and technology making sure we're going to make the future made in america and infrastructure building airports schools affordable housing upgrading the water and pipes making sure it's sustainable and resilient built and laid down by union plumbers and pipefitters here in pennsylvania and across the country in clean energy we're gonna upgrade four million buildings with weatherization of two million homes and it's estimated that will create one million good paying jobs union jobs union jobs to be filled by when men and women like in this local here look folks we're in a situation now where if you take a look at this build back better i'm going to take a second but i hope i don't take too many seconds before it rains here number one we were talking about it mr president a little while ago he promised an infrastructure plan in 2016 17 18 19. he didn't do a damn thing not one single bit he promised to relieve main street slam by the recession but guess where that money went that that the congress passed it went into the mar-a-lago crowd the wealthy i'm not joking it didn't go to small businesses it didn't go to the people who needed it my plan to revitalize american manufacturing infrastructure says we're going to use buy american rules supposed to be only buying america now well i'm going to invest 2 trillion dollars in infrastructure in clean energy from we're going to raise over 3.7 trillion dollars by eliminating that tax cut for the super wealthy and folks we're going to fix water pipes pipelines replace lead pipes upgrade treatment plants we're going to construct 1.5 million new affordable housing units we're going to build 100 billion dollars rebuilding our schools we're going to retrofit which we start in our administration four million buildings including an advanced heating and cooling system there's going to be such a race to job creation for unions that you're not going to believe it and i really mean this and by the way when i did the recovery act which was 800 billion dollars not one we had the largest infrastructure project short of eisenhower's interstate highway program since that not one single solitary dollar went to anything other than a prevailing wage had to be a prevailing wage and look i'm also going to make sure that corporate america being so kind wanting to take over registered apprenticeships you know what that's all about you guys spend a quarter billion dollars a year making sure that you have apprenticeships that are the best trained people in the world well folks i'm also going to pass the pro act they're spending over 2 billion a year trying to keep you from being able organized around the country that's a promise and also strengthen labor standards especially osha rules there's a lot there's a lot we can do but it's not enough to praise workers we've got to make sure they get benefited folks look my dad had another expression after he lost his job we moved to delaware he'd say you know he said joey a job's about a lot more than a paycheck it's about your dignity it's about respect it's about your place in the community it's about being able to look your kid in the eye and say honey it's going to be okay you know the fact is that every time the word climate change comes up donald trump thinks hoax every time it comes up i think jobs let me be clear no matter how many lies he tells i am not not not banning fracking period we'll also increase income we're going to see the burden and the cost we're going to increase we're going to make sure not prevailing wage we can't mandate that you guys by the way i said inside the other expression my dad had was there's only one way to deal with the abuse of power which corporate corporate america is exercising now it's with power and the only power we have is union power you're the guys that keep the barbarians in the other side of the gate from taking everything that's a fact so look i'll try to move along quickly here the fact is that we not ease the burden on the major costs in your life what's the average middle class person fear most they're trying to tear down the affordable care act we're going to build on it adding a new health insurance option a not-for-profit public option which is going to give private insurers real competition we're going to increase the subsidies so premiums are lower and we can afford plans with lower deductibles and lower out-of-pocket expenses because we're going to be able to do that with the money we take back from the super wealthy we're going to take on the pharmaceutical companies with a plan that slashes the cost of prescription drugs by 60 percent look folks we're going to work with states to ensure that every three four and five-year-olds has access to free high quality preschool not daycare you send them to preschool there's evidence that 58 of them will go all the way through no matter what their background no matter what poor school they poor neighborhood they come from you start them at age three they have a 58 better chance of graduating all the way through high school and beyond we're going to make sure the low and middle-income families will never have to spend more than seven percent of their income caring for their young what's the com talk to the women around here i was a single dad for five years i couldn't afford help i thank god i had my mom and my sister and my brother to help me with my kids when my wife and daughter were killed we're going to make four-year public college and universities tuition-free for families making less than 125 000 a year and when erie gets his first new community college to open in pennsylvania in 27 years we're going to make sure that it's free for anyone who qualifies to get in that's a fact and by the way that costs a lot of money it costs six billion a year that's about as much as we give a tax deduction for race horses i mean this we gotta have priorities if you're buying your first home look at all the people who've gotten out of school since the 9 11 generation where they got a high school without a graduation where they got out of college no graduations where they got they thought they had these good jobs waiting for them but they all got shut down in the great recession and now and what are they doing they're unable to make that first home down payment they're out there busting their neck and a lot of them are college graduates some of them are beyond that some of their graduate degrees and no jobs or no access well i'm going to make sure you get a tax credit for up to 15 000 bucks for your first time home buyer period that's going to provide your down payment we're going to protect social security increase benefits for millions of seniors so you can retire with dignity in some respect folks look but if we're going to get anything done we've got to come together we're going to have to vote like we've never voted before early voting is open here in pennsylvania so go vote if you can and go to the iwillvote.com pa to find out when and where you can vote early and if you requested a mail-in ballot return it as soon as possible make sure you seal it first in the secrecy envelope and then sign the declaration on the outside of the envelope before you return it as i said earlier this week on the sacred grounds of gettysburg battlefield i'm running as a proud democrat but i'm going to govern as an american president i'm going to work as hard for those who don't support me as those who do and i'm so proud in this campaign to have earned the support of so many proud and patriotic republicans including pennsylvania's former governor and secretary of homeland security tom ridge i want to thank him publicly for his endorsement he may we may not agree on everything we agree on this this is a moment to put country above party because after all this country's been through after all that america has accomplished after all the years we've stood as the beacon for the rest of the world it cannot be that here in the year 2020 we'll allow the government of the people by the people and for the people to perish on this earth as lincoln said we can do better we can do better than what we've seen we can be what we are at our best the united states of america all this division being pushed by this president all this stuff about encouraging here without and the debate we had i asked him to condemn the proud boys he said stand back and stand down but stand ready what's going on here this is not who we are this is not who we are as a country for real we can argue like hell but end of the day we come together i am more optimistic about america's chances today than i've ever been why because i think the blinders have been taken off people have realized what's really at stake here i think we can pull this together i'm optimistic i really genuinely are am but here's the deal guys we got to go

127,TJg2XSz82QU,biden,2020-10-12T18:46:22Z,Joe Biden holds drive-in rally at UAW Local 14 in Toledo | FULL RALLY,speech,terrible news for president trump and it's great news for joe biden why because last time donald trump won ohio by eight nine points it was a landslide the fact that ohio is a coin toss today is an indication of how much support donald trump has lost in the last four years and why not under his watch more jobs have been lost in this country than in any other administration since they began keeping the statistic let me say that again they began calculating jobs numbers right after world war ii under donald trump this country has lost roughly 5 million jobs no other president at any time ever since they started keeping this statistic has presided over more job loss literally he is the worst president in the history of our country when it comes to jobs so of course he would lose support the debt the national debt has grown by seven trillion dollars we see unrest on our streets and pain in the hearts of our citizens and yes almost 215 000 of us have died from a virus that was ignored and downplayed for too long that's why america is turning on donald trump that's why a state like ohio that he won pretty handily last time is a coin toss if we win ohio donald trump's presidency is over he knows it we know it and that's why we are having the visit that we're going to have today joe biden is one of us all right joe biden's dad didn't give him a million dollar loan to start his first business joe biden grew up in scranton a city almost exactly like toledo he's a blue collar hard working guy he's loved and lost faced heartbreak that few of us can fathom and through it all took the train to work for almost 30 years he's a good man and he has never forgotten about people like us here in toledo it is true 12 years ago he helped rescue the auto industry he helped rebuild the economy after the previous administration had destroyed it and when he becomes president next january he will be in a position to do the exact same thing a lot of times elections come down to a simple question are you better off today than you were four years ago i can't imagine too many people would answer yes to that question not with the worst job loss since they started doing the statistic not with hundreds of thousands of dead from a virus that was ignored and called a hoax not with the unrest on our streets are you happy with the way things are going in this country are you really heck no fortunately we have something that we can do about it 22 days when we go to the polls and elect the next president of the united states joe biden thank you look at how heavy i'm coming up look at here [Music] [Music] up [Music] hmm tell your story roll the truth around your head found for glory i ain't getting out of this bed [Music] the sun [Music] yesterday's [Music] american history is not a fairy tale thomas jefferson wrote what many believe to be the most important document in human history he was a slaveholder we've never lived up to our american ideals jefferson himself didn't but what he wrote has pulled us towards justice for more than two centuries it's always a fight it's a battle that is never fully finished but if donald trump is re-elected he will forever and fundamentally alter the character of this nation we give donald trump four more years this will not be the country envisioned by washington this will not be the nation bound together by lincoln this will not nation lifted up by roosevelt or inspired by kennedy will not be the nation but barack obama proved bends toward justice we can't and i will not let this man be re-elected president of the united states of america my stutter always used to hold me back but that changed when i met joe biden [Music] i was just a middle school kid who was struggling with a stutter vice president biden pulled me aside i hear we have something in common he said he used to stutter too but he overcame it he said something that really changed my outlook never let stuttering define you when we met he told me he'd been bullied as a kid that he spent hours practicing poetry in the mirror but it got better for him and he became an example for me it's why after our visit i decided not to hide anymore to face my stutter head-on so i started giving public speeches he inspired me kept pushing me to believe in myself dear campbell i'm so very proud of you you've grown into what i expected of you an articulate generous and wonderful young man joe biden knows every single person has had to deal with setbacks how you deal with them how you get back up that's what defines us that's what's always defined joe biden he's a guy that never quits when it comes down to it we all know that we're connected by much more than divides us i do believe we're going to be judged on how we answer that call that call of moral responsibility to whether we stand up for those who have the least among us whether we act on their behalf we have a responsibility to one another and we all are our brothers and our sisters keepers i'm joe biden and i approve this message at her best america has always been and if i have anything to do with it will be again generous confident an optimistic nation full of hope and resolve donald trump is determined to instill fear in america that's what his entire campaign for the president has come down to fear but i believe americans are stronger than that i believe will be guided by the words of pope john paul ii words drawn from the scriptures be not afraid be not afraid fear never builds the future but hope does and building the future what america does what we've always done in fact it's what we have done best and continue to do best this is the united states of america there's not a single thing beyond our capacity when we decide to do it together obamacare it was president obama's historic achievement his legacy to future generations donald trump and even some democrats want to get rid of it joe biden will never let that happen it has done too much good changed too many lives and provided too many people the peace of mind to do anything but defend it maybe others want to destroy obama's legacy joe biden will build on it i'm joe biden and i approve this message he started as a public defender ran for county council to fight discrimination championed civil rights and voting rights as a u.s senator and for eight years served by president obama's side helping make historic change donald trump is tearing our country apart we need someone who spent his life fighting for what's right who will beat donald trump and restore the soul of this nation [Music] how do you make a broken family hole [Music] the same way you make a nationhole with love and understanding and with small acts of kindness with bravery with unwavering faith [Music] we're coming together and holding on to each other we're finding mercy and grace in the moments we might have once taken for granted we have shown that the heart of this nation still beats with kindness and courage that's the soul of america joe biden is fighting for now 50 years ago this month a simple phrase echoed down the streets of new york city's west village say it loud gay and proud the people who marched that day were demanding something simple yet transformative dignity self-worth the chance to live without secrecy the strength of the lgbtq community has always been its ability to find hope in spite of setbacks so while we won't be able to march them that doesn't mean we can't celebrate together from the generations of lgbtq activists who paved the way to the victories we won to the hope we will never let die there are so many reasons to be proud we know we still have a long way to go but with courage strength and resilience of our community we will keep fighting and we will make this world better together joe and i are with you in spirit as we celebrate this year and next year when our cities are open and the equality act has fast we will come together to march to cheer and to build a nation that makes us all proud happy pride everyone faith is what

marcy [Music] captor [Music] good afternoon good afternoon toledo what an inspiring time in our great american manufacturing heartland city to welcome the next president of the united states thank you for coming today joe biden [Music] joe biden has not only been here before he has always fought for us always vice president joe biden is our trusted friend he's like an uncle he's like a brother and he's here with us in toledo toledo the home of general motors most advanced transmission facility in the entire world whoa with an additional 39 million dollars of investment announced recently and also home of the world-class jeep production platform the largest on the north american continent i can i can guarantee you without joe biden neither of them would have survived the drastic fallout from the 2008 recession we remember i remember i remember a vote in congress for the recovery act when it was democrats democrats who made sure that these firms were refinanced and they paid back every penny with interest and i remember the republicans every republican in congress from ohio and across the country but for a few voted against the refinancing of these plants that now keep the lights on here in our home city so joe biden is no wall street wannabe without his truly consequential leadership northern ohio and much of the midwest and the towns we live in would have had to turn off their lights joe biden is the real deal he's a family man with vast experience in governance not to be taken lightly he possesses decades of lived experience he's traveled hundreds of thousands of miles on behalf of our country as a senator and vice president and he's a staunch defender of liberty over tyranny he knows the difference and he knows who the enemies of liberty are in this world he's looked him in the eye and he's checked him before and he'll check him again now as a person joe biden despite having to endure more family tragedy than any of us can even imagine has continued his public service to fight for every family and every worker as if they were his relative and i can guarantee you he is a gentleman he's a unifier and not a divider an informed and transformative leader on every important issue we face as leader of the free world war and peace economic recovery nuclear security a bright new clean energy future for our country the education of our children and the health of our people joe biden respects our troops and our military leaders and he possesses the steady temperament you need in the position you won't see joe biden plumb for votes by fueling hatred joe as president will improve health care for our families he'll protect social security medicare medicaid all democratic programs and help the aspiring generation unshackle itself from skyrocketing student debt so it can lead america forward to an even brighter future this is the joe biden i know that you know and we respect i am honored to know him i have urged him to run for president of the united states not just this time but in the past as well to support him i am more than happy to do because i have worked with him on many issues that affect the lives of people in this region and across our country but also freedom's edge around the world he understands our enemies and we have to have people in that position who will protect our birthright of liberty it will be my honor to not just vote for joe biden but to work for him and senator kamala harris to build back better the america we love and the one we hope for for our children and grandchildren thank you for being here today god bless you all [Music] [Music] you know there's no right [Music] [Music] okay please welcome kenyetta jones [Music] good afternoon my name is kenyetta jones from toledo ohio and i'm proud to represent the uaw workers of local 14. autoworkers are the lifeblood of ohio and the backbone of our community so when the auto industry was on its back that meant everything came to a ground to a heart and a faith of our working families and local economies hung in the balance but in ohio we never quit joe we've seen share a lot of tough times but we keep fighting when i was laid off from general motors power train in 2009 homes were being foreclosed and local businesses were left stagnant but i didn't rest and neither did our workers i started training uaw workers and when the jobs came back we would be ready thankfully those jobs did come back because president barack obama and vice president joe biden believed in our community and the work in america just as strongly as we did president obama charged joe with the auto recovery because he knew joe wouldn't quit until we were back on our feet again joe biden understands what happens to the auto industry happens to america it's because he believes in us and he knows our grits it's his faith in and respect for the american worker that helps save our community and help saving working americans joe biden from scranton knows what it means to tell your kids that you lost your job but is going to be okay joe biden battling us then and he's betting on us now that's because joe biden understands what we the ohio auto industry workers know so well when given at least half the chance we fight with everything we have until we're thriving once again it's time to fight now for the future working that ohio deserves joe biden has never let us down and never turned his back as president joe will fight for the dignity of every worker and for the opportunity our auto industry deserves i'm proud to introduce to you the former champion of the auto industry and the working families everywhere in america our next president of united states vice president joe biden [Music] we take care of them [Applause] [Music] hello toledo this feels like coming home well i'll tell you what i uh my dad was an automobile man i got through uh school and we got through uh being able to eat after we lost a job up in scranton pennsylvania had moved down to delaware because uh because selling general motors products and so uh i've known my state used to have the largest percentage of auto workers of any state in the nation because we had a small population and the largest general motors and largest chrysler plant outside of michigan and and uh ohio and uh i saw i saw what happened when we got hit very hard we've lost both those plants well let me start off by saying mr mayor thanks for the passport in your city and marcy you've been a friend a long time thank you for your introduction you know there's no more fierce defender and there's no more fierce defender the people she grew up with than marcy she has never ever ever forgotten where she came from she's tough she she's a straight shooter she's influential in congress she's honest and she sees you you're always in her view and tony mr president i know you're new and he says piece of cake so i don't have to worry if i get elected the first hundred days uh but all kid in the side tony thank you for hosting us and thank you for local 14. and kenya you uh thanks for that introduction all you did for barack and me when we were running when we got elected jumping in and being part of helping us govern you remind me of something my dad said he said joey a job's about a lot more than a paycheck it's about your dignity it's about your place in the community it's about respect it's about being able to say to your kid and look them in the eye and say everything's going to be okay and mean it that's what job's about a decent paying job like the uaw provides this lesson i grew up with surrounded by hard-working families in scranton and then in clemont delaware where we had to move when dad lost work was no work in scranton just like here in toledo but the times are hard unemployment is way up due to the pandemic and the terrible way in which it's been handled the economic outlook remains uncertain across ohio and the country folks are worried about making the next mortgage payment or the rent payment whether or not they can purchase their prescription drugs or be able to put food on the table literally worried about whether their kids schools open and be able to stay open and if they're not open how they can go to work if they have a job and still take care of their kids they see the people at the very top doing better than ever have while they're left to wonder who's looking out for me that's donald trump's presidency 215 000 dead because of covid experts say we're likely to lose another 200 000 people in the next few months unless we take some serious action and he doesn't know what he's doing all because this president's only worried about one thing the stock market he refused to follow the science it's estimated that we just wore these mass nationally we'd save over a hundred thousand lives between now and the end of the year this president knew back in january he was briefed in detail by the intelligence community how extremely dangerous this covert virus was how communicable the disease was he went in a taped interview with bob woodward a leading journalist that's on tape been played telling woodward that he knew how dangerous the disease was but did nothing ask yourself why didn't he tell us why didn't he warn us he said nothing he told woodward that he didn't want to panic the american people that's why he said nothing we don't panic america doesn't panic but trump panicked his reckless personal conduct since his diagnosis has been unconscionable the longer donald trump is president the more reckless he seems to get dr fauci the most respected doc on this issue in the world in the country he he told the president you know the president's announcement of his pick for the supreme court in the rose garden as he referred to that as a super spreader all those people caught that got the disease how's he responding well guess what he's now running an ad you probably saw an astronaut quoting dr fauci out of context way back in march referring to public health officials dr fauci said i can't imagine that anybody could be doing more end of quote in the recent ads is going out nationally ad quotes dr fauci is saying that about him the president trump and his campaign deliberately lied making it sound like fauci was talking about trump fauci went on the public heir and the ad came out saying three days ago i did not give permission for that quote he wasn't referring to the president and even after that fauci said he didn't say that the president and the campaign even after proud he laid this out the campaign said we're still going to use it because he did say it even though it wasn't about him the point i'm trying to make is it was a knowing lie like we're being told about everything about this covert consequences as a consequence to his months of overwhelming lying misleading irresponsible action on the part of donald trump how many empty chairs were around your breakfast table this morning someone you loved someone you cared about someone you knew a family member or a neighbor missing missing and why because of negligence look i view this campaign as i've said before and i'll say it again between scranton and park avenue between toledo and park avenue all trump can see is from park avenue as wall street that's why his only metric for american prosperity that he values is the dow jones in the index like a lot of you i spent a lot of my time with guys like trump looking down on me the irish catholic kid in the neighborhood guys who thought they were better than me because they had a lot of money guys who inherited everything they ever got and still manage to squander it i have to admit and i shouldn't have done it but i've on record saying that so i'll repeat it i still have a little bit of chip on my shoulder about guys like him i read some stories after i got the nomination that quote if biden gets elected he'll be the first non-ivy league school graduate to get elected in a s80 or 90 years guys have a seat man you know what like some state school guy went to university of delaware i was proud of it hard to get there hard to get through in terms of money but folks since when can someone who went to a state university not be qualified to be president folks i know what it takes to be president i sat next to a man for eight years watching and participating my mom taught me that what you're probably taught by your parents too say joey nobody is better than you but everybody's your equal i don't measure people based on the size of their bank account i don't respect people based on whether they own a mansion i don't judge them whether they're based on whether they belong to a country club you and i measure people by the strength of their character their honesty their their courage their courage my mom used to say the greatest gift of all the greatest virtue is courage you're redeemed by your courage that's what you're saying redeemed by your loyalty honesty loyalty things that are bigger than yourself they're the neighborhoods we were raised in it's all about family decency honor opportunity these are the values i learned growing up in scranton my guess is you learned growing up in toledo wherever you grew up the people i grew up in scranton didn't have any money in stocks and our house growing up every penny my dad made went to paying the bills keeping the lights on and food and the table every penny our friends in scranton made went to paying the bills and taking care of their families as well and we looked out for our neighbors that's why i have a different measure by which i judge the health of america's economy i see hard-working women and men are just trying to earn an honest living and take care of their families just want an even shot they're not asking for anything just just asking for a fair shot and you know given a shot the american people have never ever ever ever let their country down never the other expression my dad would have he said when you see the abuse of power there's only one way to respond to it and that's with power and the only power we have to take on corporate america is union power that's the only power i just think back to 2008 when barack and i were elected and we inherited the worst recession short of a depression in history president put me in charge of the recovery act 800 billion dollars was needed to save our economy from going into depression we did it with less than two tenths of one percent waster fraud we're able to see to ohio and other states receive substantial assistance to address their economic pain and recover and rebuild to make sure we kept teachers firefighters and cops public nurses on the job people are being laid off now because you don't have the local money to do it so they didn't have to be fired because of lack of money that was the federal government stepped up and it started the longest sustained economic recovery in american history that this guy inherited and then squandered again but you know what mitch mcconnell said recently about helping the states and cities he said quote let them go bankrupt well i heard that before you heard it too republicans said the same thing about the automobile industry like i said i come from an automobile state and automobile man the auto industry supported one in eight was on the brink it was more than 10 years ago but you remember it like it was yesterday it was on the brink but brock and i bet on you and the american worker and it paid off i argued that american worker was the finest auto worker in the world management screwed it up you didn't you didn't make the mistake and by the way it all got paid back but guess who made the greatest sacrifices auto workers you made the sacrifices to get it back so it's over over the many objections of many that we stepped in and rescued the automobile industry general motors and chrysler saving one million jobs and then what happened when donald trump came to office remember what trump said in 2017 in lordstown he said don't move quote don't move don't sell your house but lordstown shut down on trump's watch and after a decade in cleveland i met after the debate in cleveland i met with an elementary school teacher from lordstown her husband was there as well one of the workers who lost his job in lordstown he had to accept a transfer to plant in kentucky eight hours away one way to maintain his health care and his pension he drives 16 hours a weekend to see her and their two kids but donald trump's betrayal doesn't stop there he betrayed union workers a good year when he called for a boycott of buying tire goodyear tires because of a personal grudge he passed the tax bill for the super wealthy and corporations that actually provided incentives for companies to move jobs overseas folks manufacturing is the backbone of america but we're in a manufacturing recession because of donald trump even before the covert virus hit we're down 647 000 manufacturing jobs nationwide since the crisis started and our balance of payments meaning we're sending more overseas than coming to us i mean the more we're buying more overseas than we're selling is higher than it's been in a long time there's still 9 10 900 lost auto worker manufacturing jobs in ohio have not come back the trump president will be the first presidency since herbert hoover over 90 years ago first president of modern history to leave office with fewer jobs than he had when he came to office donald trump's only plan is more tax cuts for the wealthy most of you if you still have a job paid more than he paid last year in tax 750 come on the system's rigged we're going to change it 30 billion dollars a new proposal just for the gains of the 100 richest billionaires in america 30 billion hear me they made 30 billion dollars alone in this year while the rest of the people are getting killed in the middle of this pandemic why do republicans have time to hold a hearing on the supreme court providing instead of providing a significant economic need for localities i'll tell you why it's about finally getting his wish to wipe out the affordable health care act because their nominee has said in the past that the law should be struck down his relentless effort to eliminate the affordable care act provided health care coverage for 20 million people who didn't have it protections for well over 100 million people with pre-existing conditions you know and we've seen his pledge quote to terminate the tax dedicated to financing social security marcie and i were talking about that you know what the actuary at the social security department said if it goes through this tax he's talking about talk cut for the so on social security it will actually bankrupt bankrupt social security by the middle of 2023. go home and tell your parents that not once has president trump called for a high-level meeting between democrats and republicans in the white house this is going on now the house already passed back in the beginning of the summer this position to be able to reconcile people in real trouble get help to states like we did he hadn't once called a meeting between democrats and republicans to deliver the new cover relief package for working families and small businesses they're going bankrupt he spent too much time in the bunker of his golf course or in the bunker of the white house then he was willing to actually sit to try to work something out check it out first president i can ever remember in the middle of a national economic crisis did not try to call the parties together he turned his back on you i promise you i will never do that folks that's why my built back better plan is built around a simple concept it's time to reward work not wealth work i mean it an independent analyst by a big wall street firm called moody's not a democratic think tank they did an analysis of my economic plan to revive this country an analysis of his here's what they concluded that my plan would create 18.6 million jobs in the next four years seven million more than the president's economic plan it would generate economic growth of an additional trillion dollars more than the president's plan look what these guys don't get is when you do well well my family does well everybody does better everybody does better that's the god's truth here's how my plan works i'm not going to raise taxes on anyone who makes less than four hundred thousand dollars a year if you make more than 400 ra beep your horn because you're going to get a tax raise well i'm going to raise your tax slightly if you're making over 400 but look you're not going to pay a penny more in fact tens of millions of middle-class families are going to get a tax cut when they need it most and raising their kids trying to get affordable health care buying their first home or saving for retirement but i'm going to ask big corporations in the super wealthy just to begin to start to pay their fair share i want to raise back the tax cut he gave for corporate america they were paying the mid 30s and now paying 21 if we just raise the tax back to what it should be 28 that generates over 100 billion dollars hear me that's money i'm excuse me 1.3 trillion dollars that's what it raises to help hard-working folks to allow us to invest in working people and grow the middle class and make sure everybody comes along this time my plan will create a million good paying union jobs manufacturing and building products and technology that we need now and in the future we're not investing in research it starts with a pretty basic idea you know the president federal government every year spent 600 billion dollars just making sure that we have ships and planes cars trains all the things the government lets contracts for well i promise you this every single product every single contract let will be only let to a company or a firm that makes it in america from beginning to end not a joke it's going to use to buy american products support american jobs we'll invest to build more resilient infrastructure roads bridges ports 1.5 million new affordable housing units high-speed broadband in every american household more important than ever we're going to rebuild crumbling schools retrofit 4 million buildings and weatherize two million homes creating one million new jobs the reason why everyone from the electric works and every other major union is strongly supporting us and it's all going to be done by certified union labor promise you may remember when the president put me in charge that 800 billion dollars not one single contract went out that wasn't prevailing wage not one so we're going to end trump's new incentive for sending jobs abroad that's what he's done more jobs are going abroad now any company that offshores a job is going to pay a 10 percent penalty any company that brings back a job or reopens a closed factory like a manufacturing path they'll get a 10 credit for their investment we're going to make trade a straight transit fights for every american worker and every american job and actually get results not trump's chaotic trade war erratic tweets on bluster that's only stiffed american workers and consumers including farmers he's let you down he's let us down i promise you i will stand up to china's trade abuses and i will invest in the american worker because i know no one nobody can out compete an american worker when they've gotten a fair shot nobody in the world one more thing the united states government owns and maintains an enormous fleet of vehicles we're going to convert many of them to electric vehicles and you're going to still need to build these transmissions and for a long time to come but any new jobs in that area are going to go to people who in the automobile industry who are in the manufacturing in the uaw are going to be making these new vehicles sourced right here in america the government will provide and demand support to retool factories that are struggling to compete the us auto industry will step up i'll expand capacity so the united states not china leads the world in modern new technology we're going to make it easier for american consumers to move to the vehicles of the future by building the network of 500 000 charging stations across the country we're offering consumers rebates to swap older fuel-efficient cars we're going to move in a direction that technology is taking us and making sure the uaw leads the way in how we do it together this will mean one million good new jobs in the auto industry folks it's an example of how we can do anything i'm more optimistic about what we have a chance to do in the next four to six years eight years than anything anytime in my whole career the blinders have been taken off the american people they've seen but the combination of the pandemic the economic crisis the racial inequality we're facing and what's going on internationally and they're ready to step up they know we have to change nothing nothing nothing is beyond the capacity of the united states of america and i mean that think about it we're the only country in the world that's come out of every crisis stronger than we went in because of who we are as i've said to other world leaders never underestimate the american people there's no there's no quit in america there's none in america we can do anything that we need to do if we can do it together nothing can stop us you know we have to come together that's why i'm running i'm running as a proud democrat for the senate when i ran as a proud democrat for vice president i'm running as a proud democrat for president but i promise you this i will govern as an american president i'll govern for everyone who voted for me as well as against me we can be better than what we've seen we can be what we are at our best the united states of america so vote vote visit iowa.com ohio god bless you god bless the auto workers god protect thank you which way am i going we take care of them [Music] he'd say to me joey my grandfather said joey keep the faith and my grandmother when she was live said no joey spread it go spread the faith let's win this thing [Music] [Applause] [Music]

because of covid expert say PRON be likely to lose another people in the next few month unless PRON take some serious action and PRON do not know what PRON be do all because this president only worried about one thing the stock market PRON refuse to follow the science PRON be estimate that PRON just wear these mass nationally PRON would save over a hundred thousand life between now and the end of the year this president know back in january PRON be brief in detail by the intelligence community how extremely dangerous this covert virus be how communicable the disease be PRON go in a tape interview with bob woodward a lead journalist that be on tape be play tell woodward that PRON know how dangerous the disease be but do nothing ask PRON why do not PRON tell PRON why do not PRON warn PRON PRON say nothing PRON tell woodward that PRON do not want to panic the american people that be why PRON say nothing PRON do not panic america do not panic but trump panic PRON reckless personal conduct since PRON diagnosis have be unconscionable the longer donald trump be president the more reckless PRON seem to get dr fauci the most respected doc on this issue in the world in the country PRON PRON tell the president PRON know the president announcement of PRON pick for the supreme court in the rose garden as PRON refer to that as a super spreader all those people catch that get the disease how be PRON respond well guess what PRON be now run an ad PRON probably see an astronaut quote dr fauci out of context way back in march refer to public health official dr fauci say i can not imagine that anybody could be do more end of quote in the recent ad be go out nationally ad quote dr fauci be say that about PRON the president trump and PRON campaign deliberately lie make PRON sound like fauci be talk about trump fauci go on the public heir and the ad come out say three day ago i do not give permission for that quote PRON be not refer to the president and even after that fauci say PRON do not say that the president and the campaign even after proud PRON lay this out the campaign say PRON be still go to use PRON because PRON do say PRON even though PRON be not about PRON the point PRON be try to make be PRON be a know lie like PRON be be tell about everything about this covert consequence as a consequence to PRON month of overwhelming lie misleading irresponsible action on the part of donald trump how many empty chair be around PRON breakfast table this morning someone PRON love someone PRON care about someone PRON know a family member or a neighbor miss miss and why because of negligence look i view this campaign as PRON have say before and PRON will say PRON again between scranton and park avenue between toledo and park avenue all trump can see be from park avenue as wall street that be why PRON only metric for american prosperity that PRON value be the dow jones in the index like a lot of PRON i spend a lot of PRON time with guy like trump look down on PRON the irish catholic kid in the neighborhood guy who think PRON be well than PRON because PRON have a lot of money guy who inherit everything PRON ever get and still manage to squander PRON i have to admit and i should not have do PRON but PRON have on record say that so PRON will repeat PRON i still have a little bit of chip on PRON shoulder about guy like PRON i read some story after i get the nomination that quote if biden get elect PRON will be the first non ivy league school graduate to get elect in a s or year guy have a seat man PRON know what like some state school guy go to university of delaware i be proud of PRON hard to get there hard to get through in term of money but folk since when can someone who go to a state university not be qualified to be president folk i know what PRON take to be president i sit next to a man for eight year watch and participate PRON mom teach PRON that what PRON be probably teach by PRON parent too say joey nobody be well than PRON but everybody be PRON equal i do not measure people base on the size of PRON bank account i do not respect people base on whether PRON own a mansion i do not judge PRON whether PRON be base on whether PRON belong to a country club PRON and i measure people by the strength of PRON character PRON honesty PRON PRON courage PRON courage PRON mom use to say the great gift of all the great virtue be courage PRON be redeem by PRON courage that be what PRON be say redeem by PRON loyalty honesty loyalty thing that be big than PRON PRON be the neighborhood PRON be raise in PRON be all about family decency honor opportunity these be the value i learn grow up in scranton PRON guess be PRON learn grow up in toledo wherever PRON grow up the people i grow up in scranton do not have any money in stock and PRON house grow up every penny PRON dad make go to pay the bill keep the light on and food and the table every penny PRON friend in scranton make go to pay the bill and take care of PRON family as well and PRON look out for PRON neighbor that be why i have a different measure by which i judge the health of america economy i see hard work woman and man be just try to earn an honest living and take care of PRON family just want an even shoot PRON be not ask for anything just just ask for a fair shot and PRON know give a shot the american people have never ever ever ever let PRON country down never the other expression PRON dad would have PRON say when PRON see the abuse of power there be only one way to respond to PRON and that be with power and the only power PRON have to take on corporate america be union power that be the only power i just think back to when barack and i be elect and PRON inherit the bad recession short of a depression in history president put PRON in charge of the recovery act billion dollar be need to save PRON economy from go into depression PRON do PRON with less than two tenth of one percent waster fraud PRON be able to see to ohio and other state receive substantial assistance to address PRON economic pain and recover and rebuild to make sure PRON keep teacher firefighter and cop public nurse on the job people be be lay off now because PRON do not have the local money to do PRON so PRON do not have to be fire because of lack of money that be the federal government step up and PRON start the longest sustained economic recovery in american history that this guy inherit and then squander again but PRON know what mitch mcconnell say recently about help the state and city PRON say quote let PRON go bankrupt well i hear that before PRON hear PRON too republicans say the same thing about the automobile industry like i say i come from an automobile state and automobile man the auto industry support one in eight be on the brink PRON be more than year ago but PRON remember PRON like PRON be yesterday PRON be on the brink but brock and i bet on PRON and the american worker and PRON pay off i argue that american worker be the fine auto worker in the world management screw PRON up PRON do not PRON do not make the mistake and by the way PRON all get pay back but guess who make the great sacrifice auto worker PRON make the sacrifice to get PRON back so PRON be over over the many objection of many that PRON step in and rescue the automobile industry general motor and chrysler save one million job and then what happen when donald trump come to office remember what trump say in in lordstown PRON say do not move quote do not move do not sell PRON house but lordstown shut down on trump watch and after a decade in cleveland i meet after the debate in cleveland i meet with an elementary school teacher from lordstown PRON husband be there as well one of the worker who lose PRON job in lordstown PRON have to accept a transfer to plant in kentucky eight hour away one way to maintain PRON health care and PRON pension PRON drive hour a weekend to see PRON and PRON two kid but donald trump betrayal do not stop there PRON betray union worker a good year when PRON call for a boycott of buy tire goodyear tire because of a personal grudge PRON pass the tax bill for the super wealthy and corporation that actually provide incentive for company to move job overseas folk manufacturing be the backbone of america but PRON be in a manufacturing recession because of donald trump even before the covert virus hit PRON be down manufacture job nationwide since the crisis start and PRON balance of payment mean PRON be send more overseas than come to PRON i mean the more PRON be buy more overseas than PRON be sell be high than PRON be be in a long time there be still lose auto worker manufacture job in ohio have not come back the trump president will be the first presidency since herbert hoover over year ago first president of modern history to leave office with few job than PRON have when PRON come to office donald trump only plan be more tax cut for the wealthy most of PRON if PRON still have a job pay more than PRON pay last year in tax come on the system rig PRON be go to change PRON billion dollar a new proposal just for the gain of the rich billionaire in america billion hear PRON PRON make billion dollar alone in this year while the rest of the people be get kill in the middle of this pandemic why do republican have time to hold a hearing on the supreme court provide instead of provide a significant economic need for locality PRON will tell PRON why PRON be about finally get PRON wish to wipe out the affordable health care act because PRON nominee have say in the past that the law should be strike down PRON relentless effort to eliminate the affordable care act provide health care coverage for million people who do not have PRON protection for well over million people with pre existing condition PRON know and PRON have see PRON pledge quote to terminate the tax dedicate to finance social security marcie and i be talk about that PRON know what the actuary at

new cover relief package for work family and small business PRON be go bankrupt PRON spend too much time in the bunker of PRON golf course or in the bunker of the white house then PRON be willing to actually sit to try to work something out check PRON out first president i can ever remember in the middle of a national economic crisis do not try to call the party together PRON turn PRON back on PRON i promise PRON i will never do that folk that be why PRON build back well plan be build around a simple concept PRON be time to reward work not wealth work i mean PRON an independent analyst by a

130,Pn_kOtZxwsA,biden,2020-10-13T19:45:31Z,Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden delivers remarks in Florida — 10/13/2020,speech,please welcome the next president of the united states joe biden [Music] [Applause] hello [Music] good to see you all please please take a seat if you have one thank you so very very much for it's good to be back in florida and i want to thank my good friend debbie wasserman schultz congresswoman she's been a tireless fighter where's debbie there she is thank you debbie you've been a friend a long time and thank you for uh all the encouragement and uh toby i also want to thank you uh toby moved from a high rent district in brooklyn that's the highest rentistic in america right now these days boy man good to see you and i want to thank you for that kind introduction and it's wonderful to be here with with all of you to hear the stories talk about how we're going to get through these tough times and difficult times today's uh today's story is a familiar one here in south florida uh we're all in we're all living some version of it right now with some of the most important parts of our lives being put on hold and uh the same story being lived by people like uh like carl scheckner who many of you uh know well carl's here today i'm told i don't know all right hey carl how are you man good to see you the light was shining right in my eyes looking at you man i apologize carl is uh 39 years old no 93 years old but he acts like he's 39 years old and the pillar of this community so much so that a few years back you all decided to rename this community center in his honor i've heard wonderful things about you carl and looking forward to saying hello to you privately you know i had the pleasure of meeting carl back in 2012. he may not remember it but his story is what this community and this country is all about carl as the son of an immigrant carl served our nation honorably in the second world war and met as sweetheart anita when they were they've been married now for 67 years together they built a family four children seven grandchildren and uh more than 30 years they made home here staying engaged in all the local issues and holding local office catching sunday matinees and performance at the art center and the center and socializing with neighbors enjoying nights in the town and a couple times two three times a week going out and uh but but their story like so many others is a quintessential american story these days it wasn't but has been interrupted this year carl and anita haven't been out i'm told to a restaurant in seven months and they're no more sunday matinees other than getting groceries they spend most of their time in their apartment like so many people do it's harder than ever to spend time with the people you love other than on zoom or on a computer connection we've all felt that sense of interruption in our lives and we all know that this this isn't normal that things didn't have to be this bad they didn't have to be this bad we look around at our neighbors and we know people are hurting a lot of folks are worried about making their next rent payment their next mortgage payment they're not only they uh whether or not they can purchase their prescription drugs or put food on the table and we see awful lot of people at the very top doing better than they've ever done and left to wonder an awful lot of us is who's looking out for me who's looking out for me that's been his story the entire story of my view of donald trump's presidency the fact that he's never been focused on what matters he's never been focused on you his handling of this pandemic has been erratic just like his presidency has been and it has prevented florida seniors and people all across the country from getting the relief that they need donald trump hasn't just been willing to not do the work i think it's that beyond that i'm not sure he cares about delivering any real help i think it's both people say he's not willing to do the work well i don't think he cares much about him while you're losing precious time with your loved ones he's been stuck in a sand trap in one of his golf courses and when he does decide to lift a finger it doesn't help you mr proposed new tax cuts for billionaires and i'm not that's not hyperbole that's not hyperbole 100 wealthiest billionaires in america are expected to get another 30 billion tax cut he's proposing we know what happened the last time a tax cut was passed in 2019 like 2017 when he came into office pharmaceutical companies got billions of dollars in tax breaks and then they turned around and raised prices for medicines that you rely on to stay healthy and they're still doing it even during the pandemic and quite frankly it's unconscionable but trump doesn't really care about lowering the health care costs because he's beholding to health insurance companies and the drug companies after all he's asking the united states supreme court as i speak he's asking them right now to strike down the entire affordable care act which would eliminate seniors ability everyone most of you are a medicare but it would eliminate your ability and that act we passed while i was able to help put in place was that you'd have preventative services and annual checkups and mammograms for free under medicare if it gets struck down that gets wiped out as well the rise in prescription drug prices for millions of seniors and putting medicare for trust fund at risk and by the way we used to talk about the medicare trust fund i say the republicans want to eliminate it but remember debbie remember when he's not a bad guy in terms of his personality but when the former speaker of the house became speaker what'd they do they proposed a half a billion dollars cut in medicare from the start right out the back these guys mean what they say this president as debbie pointed out his pledge to terminate the tax that's dedicated to financing social security terminated now social security actuary not joe biden or a liberal think tank or a newspaper this the actuary the social security says that would bankrupt social security in just a few years putting those monthly checks for tens of millions of seniors with the rely on the men and the only thing they rely on at risk all this president knows how to do is play games with people's lives and family's futures last week he announced he was quote walking away from the negotiations that were never he never fully engaged in like he's not walking away he never fully engaged in him to provide any additional relief for american families debbie working like the devil in the house they passed the heroes act they passed two other pieces of legislation earlier to provide for the ability to keep people from going out of business people bailing being kicked out of their homes etc he turned his back on small businesses that are struggling to keep their doors open he turned his back on firefighters and police officers and first responders who depend on local budgets but local budgets are being broken and they have to be balanced i'll just take make note here when we inherited the largest recession the greatest recession since the depression what happened president put me in charge of the recovery act 800 billion dollars first thing i was able to do and i was able to manage it myself was that put 147 billion dollars and help state and local authorities be able to balance their budgets not have to fire police officers not have to fire firefighters not to fire first responders not to close down health clinics local governments are strained to the breaking point he turned his back on educators and school children stand in the way of support to get them ppe and cleaning supplies and ventilation needed to reopen school safely which we could do if we funded it he turned his back on every single worker whose job hasn't come back and now he says he wants a deal one day he's tweeting that the relief package is too big the next day he's saying is too small it's all a game he thinks he's still on his game show no really he acts that way for real this is a political game he's playing his latest gimmick he wants to mail seniors a 200 prescription drug cash card with his name on it so you're going to get it before election with his name on it but what he's going to do he's going to raid medicare trust fund to pay for that 200 which seniors have already spent by paying money into he thinks that he can take the money out of your pocket with one hand and put it back with his name stamped on it on the other hand and call it a gift it's dishonest it's reckless and it doesn't actually help anybody in fact all i'll do is undermine the medicare trust fund and increase overall out-of-pocket costs for seniors let's be clear about this donald trump has tried for almost four years to lower he says he wants to lower drug prices okay but he hadn't done a single thing to do it in fact the house of representatives passed a bill debbie supported that would bring down prescription drug costs across the board giving medicare the power the in washington medicare department the power to negotiate to negotiate with the drug companies and say we're not if if an aspirin is going to cost if they're being charged they're making this up and if announcements are going to cost two two cents an astronaut they said we're only going to pay a penny in aspirin they're either going to do it or not they're going to have to do it we've been fighting to get debbie and i and others been fighting to be able to do this for years it would lower drug prices what did president trump do he instead if it passes he'll veto it threaten to veto it folks donald trump's chaotic and divisive leadership has cost us far too much 215 000 dead from coba 19 and rising experts say we'll lose nearly another 200 000 lives in the next few months unless he fundamentally changed course you know i wish i prayed for his recovery when he got covered and i hoped at least he'd come out of it somewhat chastened but what has he done he's just doubled down on the misinformation he did before in making it worse so many lives have been lost unnecessary because this president cares more about the stock market than he does about you know well-being of seniors one day before we cross the threshold of 200 000 deaths you may recall this the president was at a campaign rally and he insisted that the virus was and i quote affects virtually nobody quote just elderly people with heart and other problems nobody think about that who was he talking about when he said it affects virtually nobody he was talking about america's seniors he was talking about you he's talking about my family you've worked hard your whole life contributing to society building the family building the country serving america you deserve security you deserve respect and peace of mind but you're not getting it and by the way if this wasn't so bizarre you'd think you know if i tried to make a movie talking about something like this in america you'd think i was making it up because donald trump it's simple not a joke you're expendable you're forgettable you're virtually nobody that's how he sees seniors that's how he sees you it's no surprise this is the same man who looks at americans who put their lives on the line like you did sir and many others maybe in this room for our nation and calls them losers and suckers i carry this card with me every day for the last 15 years and the bass my schedule in the back of the schedule i have a black box it says daily troupe update the number of troops who died in iraq and afghanistan 6924 not roughly 6900 924 because every one of these fallen angels left a family behind deserves to be remembered everyone u.s troops wounded in iraq and afghanistan 53 000 as of today 194 everyone with only one sacred obligation in america to care for those we send to war and equip them when they come home take care of them and their families and what did he say losers my son volunteered to go to iraq for a year before that he had been in kosovo for eight months best of my knowledge the only foreigner has a war monument and a major highway in that country named after him for his contributions helping him set up their criminal justice system then he volunteered to go to iraq as attorney general for a year my son was not a loser and all those who left behind he's passed away but all those left behind they were heroes there are patriots i imagine that's one of the reasons why six four-star generals and a whole lot of others have endorsed me who used to work for him because they know where his heart isn't that's how he sees us that's the attitude he's brought to this whole crisis this is the same man you may remember when he was told we were averaging 1 000 lives lost per day remember what he said he said it is what it is such concern and empathy it is what it is well it is what it is because he is who he is that's what israelis is this president as debbie referenced back in january when he was being briefed by the intelligence community he said i never read the briefing didn't know it was in it didn't have time well the sabika's ego moved him to try to convince a famous journalist to write something good about them what happened bob woodward interviewed him he acknowledged that he knew it was a dangerous and highly communicable disease but he did nothing he didn't do a thing he didn't tell you he didn't tell any american why he told woodward on tape he told baboon he didn't want to panic the american public americans don't panic trump panics this reckless personal conduct since his diagnosis is unconscionable the longer donald trump is present the more reckless he seems to get thank god we only have three weeks left to go dr fauci most respected doc in the country on these issues you know referred to the president's announcement on the supreme court in the rose garden using the white house as a backdrop for political events he said it was a super spreader event how is trump responding he's running a national ad quoting dr fauci out of context fauci had said way back in march referring to public health officials across the nation he said quote i can't imagine anybody could be doing more end of quote meaning public health officials at the trump campaign which is not unusual because i've had a piece of it trump campaign has deliberately lied they have put dr fauci in their ad asserting that fauci was talking about trump when he said couldn't have done any more but fauci is a man of integrity after that ad came out saying he said i did not give permission to use that quote and i wasn't referring to the president even when after fauci said that he didn't say that about the president the trump ad campaign said they were going to continue to use the ad knowing knowing it was a lie can anybody remember anything like that in a presidential campaign with a mainstream candidate and as a consequence to months of line misleading irresponsible action on the part of donald trump how many empty chairs are around the dining room table of the night because of his negligence how many people's hearts are broken how many people have trouble going to sleep at night because they can't just reach over and touch they can't hear their son or daughter's voice on the phone while he throws super spreader parties at the white house where republicans hug each other without concern of the consequences how many of you been unable to hug your grandkids in the last seven months i got six of them two of them my deceased sons boys they live not children boy and a girl live not far from me they can walk through the woods the only way i can see them i stand on the back porch and they stand down and we and i i bribe them with haagen-dazs bars but they i every single day i contact them but i can't hug them i can't embrace them and i'm luckier than most because they're nearby those two of the six my grandkids your grandkids who hope will grow up to treat one others kindness respect and empathy qualities the president has never ever shown it's become painfully clear as this careless arrogant reckless covet response has caused one of the worst tragedies in american history the only senior that donald trump cares about the only senior is senior donald trump they don't seem to do anything before and by the way you know minority communities are getting particularly hit by this you realize as of about a month ago on a percentage basis one in 1 000 african-americans in all america have died and the estimate is by the end of this year one in 500 african americans in america will die one in 500. he doesn't do something quickly and we hit 400 000 that is more people same number of people that died in the war you fought of all four years four hundred thousand dead world war two in less than a year if he doesn't move the only one donald trump will do anything for is donald trump look folks you all know it we're so much better than this we can contain this virus we can fully reopen our economy we can bring congress together to pass real relief and then implement a comprehensive agenda to build back better my my my economic proposal and by the way it's not a liberal think tank or a democratic think tank that says this an independent analysis put out by moody's a wall street firm projects that my economic plan will create 18.6 million good paying jobs between now and the end of the first term seven million more jobs than the president's plan and create a trillion more dollars in economic growth in the president's plan it's solid it's real here's how my plan works i'm not going to raise taxes on a single solitary american making less than 400 000 a year we won't pay a penny more it's a guarantee but i'm going to ask big corporations of the wealthy to begin to pay their fair share to straighten out the tax structure that money will allow us to invest in working people and carry with me i don't know if i have it with me now i don't a card that lists all of what is in the tax code we went ahead the president's tax plan brock and i were suggesting we reduce corporate tax from 35 percent to 28 that was the consensus he reduced it to 21. you know how much that cost 1.3 trillion dollars we just take it back up to 28. it'll generate 1.3 trillion dollars more 91 of the fortune 500 companies don't pay a penny in tax not a single solitary cent if we made sure there was a minimum tax of 15 that would add another 400 billion dollars we're going to take this money and we're going to invest in a working people and a growing middle class and make sure everyone is included in the deal i want to actually reform the tax code because we're spending your tax dollars on the wrong things as i said donald trump trump cut the tax from 35 to 21 costing the treasury a fortune as i said if we raise it back to 28 percent 1.3 trillion dollars would come to the treasury over the next decade instead of giving big corporations hundreds of billions in to pay for buyback and buying back their own stock moving jobs overseas we should invest in cures for cancer diabetes alzheimer's and parkinson's that's why i proposed giving the national institute of health 50 billion dollars over the next four years to go after cancer diabetes alzheimer's and parkinson's if we do not and no drug company has the capacity to do it if we do not find an answer to alzheimer's within the next 19 years every single solitary bed that exists in the united states of america now will be occupied by alzheimer's patient look my dad used to have an expression he said joey if everything's equally important to you nothing's important to you you have to have priorities what are our priorities our priorities are to make sure that everybody in america has an equal shot this is about you it's about what's fair it's about what our priorities should be and we can deal with the scourge of cancer and these other diseases but donald trump has no interest in facts he wants to do the opposite he proposes more tax cuts for the super wealthy like donald trump we're going to ease the burden on major costs in your life unlike him including the financial burden of caregiving so many families are now carrying right now as you probably know and you have friends 800 000 americans who are eligible for home community care through medicaid signed up for it have been waiting an average of five years they're waiting for a phone call back for some it's for some five years my plan makes a bold investment so the states can clear the waiting list we'll also take the pharmaceutical companies we'll allow medicaid to again use its enormous bargaining power to negotiate prices for and bring costs down for everyone not just seniors give all americans access to those lower prices and what he also hates my doing is so do the drug companies we're going to establish a board like as in other countries of outside experts to set limits on the price's new specialty drugs that are life-saving drugs that cost an arm and a leg figuratively and literally that have no competition this board is going to set up and say this is how much you can charge based on what you've invested you make a healthy profit but you will not be able to raise the price of the drug without proof that you've taken other action that you've required you to improve the drug so it can only be raised at the cost of medical inflation independent analysis found that my plan will slash the cost of prescription drugs by 60 percent how many of you know somebody who's had to sell things just to get the drugs that have gone up exponentially we're going to protect social security and increase benefits for millions of seniors i'll fight to protect your pensions including fixing fixing multiple employer pensions so many floridians earned and deserve folks i guess you'll see them with this i'm confident i know as bad as things are saying oh my god how can it get better i am absolutely confident we can do this and more we just have to come together i'm running as a proud democrat but i'm going to govern as an american president i'm going to work as hard for those who vote against me as those who voted for me that's the job of a president a duty to care to care for everyone and after all we've been through all america is accomplished all the years that we've stood as a beacon to the world we cannot let ourselves remain divided but we have to vote go to iwillvote.com fl you can still request your vote by mail ballot the deadline is october 24th request your ballot if you haven't already mail it or drop it in one of the drop boxes today look i'm tired of us all walking around with our heads down as if there's nothing we can do this is the united states of america there's not a single thing beyond our capacity nothing we've ever decided to do we've not accomplished when we've done it together i remember when we were kids we had to learn about a famous speech john kennedy made about going to the moon everybody remembers the different pieces of it the part i remember my colleagues used to kid me in the senate when i was there when asked answering the unasked question why was he doing it he said because we refuse to postpone we refuse to postpone one more day what's within our capacity as americans to do there's nothing beyond our capacity there's no limit to our future we've got to stand up lift our heads up the only thing that can tear america apart is america itself and he's well on the way trying to do that everybody knows who donald trump is that phil don't know who we are who we are we choose hope over fear unity over division science over fiction and yes truth over lies we can do this folks i promise you but you've got to vote may god bless you all and may god protect our troops thank you for listening you're a very patient audience appreciate it thanks i wish i could shake all your hands every time i used to walk out of my grandpa finnegan's house up in scranton pennsylvania he'd yell joey keep the faith and my grandmama when she's live she said no joey spread it let's go spread the faith thanks

PRON have prevent florida senior and people all across the country from get the relief that PRON need donald trump have not just be willing to not do the work i think PRON be that beyond that PRON be not sure PRON care about deliver any real help i think PRON be both people say PRON be not willing to do the work well i do not think PRON care much about PRON while PRON be lose precious time with PRON love one PRON be be stick in a sand trap in one of PRON golf course and when PRON do decide to lift a finger PRON do not help PRON mr propose new tax cut for billionaire and PRON be not that be

into office pharmaceutical company get billion of dollar in tax break and then PRON turn around and raise price for medicine that PRON rely on to stay healthy and PRON be still do PRON even during the pandemic and quite frankly PRON be unconscionable but trump do not really care about lower the health care cost because PRON be behold to health insurance company and the drug company after all PRON be ask the united states supreme court as i speak PRON be ask PRON right now to strike down the entire affordable care act which would eliminate senior ability everyone most of PRON be a medicare but PRON would eliminate PRON ability and that act PRON pass while i be able to help put in place be that PRON would have preventative service and annual checkup and mammogram for free under medicare if PRON get strike down that get wipe out as well the rise in prescription drug price for million of senior and put medicare for trust fund at risk and by the way PRON use to talk about the medicare trust fund i say the republicans want to eliminate PRON but remember debbie remember when PRON be not a bad guy in term of PRON personality but when the former speaker of the house become speaker what d PRON do PRON propose a half a billion dollar cut in medicare from the start right out the back these guy mean what PRON say this president as debbie point out PRON pledge to terminate the tax that be dedicate to finance social security terminate now social security actuary not joe biden or a liberal think tank or a newspaper this the actuary the social security say that would bankrupt social security in just a few year put those monthly check for ten of million of senior with the rely on the man and the only thing PRON rely on at risk all this president know how to do be play game with people life and family future last week PRON announce PRON be quote walk away from the negotiation that be never PRON never fully engage in like PRON be not walk away PRON never fully engage in PRON to provide any additional relief for american family debbie work like the devil in the house PRON pass the hero act PRON pass two other piece of legislation earlier to provide for the ability to keep people from go out of business people bail be kick out of PRON home etc PRON turn PRON back on small business that be struggle to keep PRON door open PRON turn PRON back on firefighter and police officer and first responder who depend on local budget but local budget be be break and PRON have to be balance PRON will just take make note here when PRON inherit the large recession the great recession since the depression what happen president put PRON in charge of the recovery act billion dollar first thing i be able to do and i be able to manage PRON PRON be that put billion dollar and help state and local authority be able to balance PRON budget not have to fire police officer not have to fire firefighter not to fire first responder not to close down health clinic local government be strain to the breaking point PRON turn PRON back on educator and school child stand in the way of support to get PRON ppe and clean supply and ventilation need to reopen school safely which PRON could do if PRON fund PRON PRON turn PRON back on every single worker whose job have not come back and now PRON say PRON want a deal one day PRON be tweet that the relief package be too big the next day PRON be say be too small PRON be all a game PRON think PRON be still on PRON game show no really PRON act that way for real this be a political game PRON be play PRON late gimmick PRON want to mail senior a prescription drug cash card with PRON name on PRON so PRON be go to get PRON before election with PRON name on PRON but what PRON be go to do PRON be go to raid medicare trust fund to pay for that which senior have already spend by pay money into PRON think that PRON can take the money out of PRON pocket with one hand and put PRON back with PRON name stamp on PRON on the other hand and call PRON a gift PRON be dishonest PRON be reckless and PRON do not actually help anybody in fact all PRON will do be undermine the medicare trust fund and increase overall out of pocket cost for senior let PRON be clear about this donald trump have try for almost four year to lower PRON say PRON want to lower drug price okay but PRON have not do a single thing to do PRON in fact the house of

be only go to pay a penny in aspirin PRON be either go to do PRON or not PRON be go to have to do PRON PRON have be fight to get debbie and i and other been fight to be able to do this for year PRON would lower drug price what do president trump do PRON instead if PRON pass PRON will veto PRON threaten to veto PRON folk donald trump chaotic and divisive leadership have cost PRON far too much dead from coba and rise expert say PRON will lose nearly another life in the next few month unless PRON fundamentally change course PRON know i wish i pray for PRON recovery when PRON get cover and i hope at least PRON would come out of PRON somewhat chasten but what have PRON do PRON be just double down on the misinformation PRON do before in make PRON bad so many life have be lose unnecessary because this president care more about the stock market than PRON do about PRON know well being of senior one day before PRON cross the threshold of death PRON may recall this the president be at a campaign

nation and call PRON loser and sucker i carry this card with PRON every day for the last year and the bass PRON schedule in the back of the schedule i have a black box PRON say daily troupe update the

solid PRON be real here be how PRON plan work PRON be not go to raise taxis on a single solitary american make less than a year PRON will not pay a penny more PRON be a guarantee but PRON be go to ask big corporation of the wealthy to begin to pay PRON fair share to straighten out the tax structure that money will allow PRON to invest in work people and carry with PRON i do not know if i have PRON with PRON now i do not a card that list all of what be in the tax code PRON go ahead the president tax plan brock and i be suggest PRON reduce corporate tax from percent to that be the consensus PRON reduce PRON to PRON know how much that cost trillion dollar PRON just take PRON back up to PRON will generate trillion dollar more of the fortune company do not pay a penny in tax not a single solitary cent if PRON make sure there be a minimum tax of that would add another billion dollar PRON be go to take this money and PRON be go to invest in a work people and a grow middle class and make sure everyone be include in the deal i want to actually reform the tax code because PRON be spend PRON tax dollar on the wrong thing as i say donald trump trump cut the tax from to cost the treasury a fortune as i say if PRON raise PRON back to percent trillion dollar would come to the treasury over the next decade instead of give big corporation hundred of billion in to pay for buyback and buy back PRON own stock move job overseas PRON should invest in cure for cancer diabetes alzheimer and parkinson that be why i propose give the national institute of health billion dollar over the next four year to go after cancer diabetes alzheimer and parkinson if PRON do not and no drug company have the capacity to do PRON if PRON do not find an answer to alzheimer within the next year every single solitary bed that exist in the united states of america now will be occupy by alzheimer patient look PRON dad use to have an expression PRON say joey if everything be equally important to PRON nothing be important to PRON PRON have to have priority what be PRON priority PRON priority be to make sure that everybody in america have an equal shot this be about PRON PRON be about what be fair PRON be about what PRON priority should be and PRON can deal with the scourge of cancer and these other disease but donald trump have no interest in fact PRON want to do the opposite PRON propose more tax cut for the super wealthy like donald trump PRON be go to ease the burden on major cost in PRON life unlike PRON include the financial burden of caregive so many family be now carry right now as PRON probably know and PRON have friend americans who be eligible for home community care through medicaid sign up for PRON have be wait an average of five year PRON be wait for a phone call back for some PRON be for some five year PRON plan make a bold investment so the state can clear the waiting list PRON will also take the pharmaceutical company PRON will allow medicaid to again use PRON enormous bargaining power to negotiate price for and bring cost down for everyone not just senior give all americans access to those low price and what PRON also hate PRON doing be so do the drug company PRON be go to establish a board like as in other country of outside expert to set limit on the price new specialty drug that be life save drug that cost an arm and a leg figuratively and literally that have no competition this board be go to set up and say this be how much PRON can charge base on what PRON have invest PRON make a healthy profit but PRON will not be able to raise the price of the drug without proof that PRON have take other action that PRON have require PRON to improve the drug so PRON can only be raise at the cost of medical inflation independent analysis find that PRON plan will slash the cost of prescription drug by percent how many of PRON know somebody who be have to sell thing just to get the drug that have go up exponentially PRON be go to protect social security and increase benefit for million of senior PRON will fight to protect PRON pension include fix fix multiple employer pension so many floridian earn and deserve folk i guess PRON will see PRON with this PRON be confident i know as bad as thing be say oh my god how can PRON get well i be absolutely confident PRON can do this and more PRON just have to come together PRON be run as a proud democrat but PRON be go to govern as an american president PRON be go to work as hard for those who vote against PRON as those who vote for PRON that be the job of a president a duty to care to care for everyone and after all PRON have be through all america be accomplish all the year that PRON have stand as a beacon to the world PRON can not let PRON remain divided but PRON have to vote go to iwillvote com fl PRON can still request PRON vote by mail ballot the deadline be october th request PRON ballot if PRON have not already mail PRON or drop PRON in one of the drop box today look PRON be tired of PRON all walk around with PRON head down as if there be nothing PRON can do this be the united states of america there be not a single thing beyond PRON capacity nothing PRON have ever decide to do PRON have not accomplish when PRON have do PRON together i remember when PRON be kid PRON have to learn about a famous speech john kennedy make about go to the moon everybody remember the different piece of PRON the part i remember PRON colleague use to kid PRON in the senate when i be there when ask answer the unasked question why be PRON do PRON PRON say because PRON refuse to postpone PRON refuse to postpone one more day what be within PRON capacity as americans to do there be nothing beyond PRON capacity there be no limit to PRON future PRON have get to stand up lift PRON head up the only thing that can tear america apart be america PRON and PRON be well on the way try to do that everybody know who donald trump be that phil do not know who PRON be who PRON be

morning number one in the evening and the number one show on all of television number one in late night versus the competition number one in politics versus the competition the number one daytime talk

smarter better happier this is gma3 what you need to know lunchtime at one eastern 12 central and pacific on abc it was john lennon magical brilliant daring john was my favorite beatles now new interviews with those who were right there with john lennon and his last interview all on that day the 2020 event john lennon friday night on abc welcome back to our town hall with former vice president joe biden the next question comes from mark hoffman center valley pennsylvania conservative who voted for trump in 2016. welcome to pennsylvania mr vice president good to be back home i'm from pennsylvania yes i know scranton right yep so peace is breaking out all over the world our troops are coming home serbia is talking to kosovo and the arabs and israelis are talking peace which i believe is a modern day miracle what's going on does president trump's foreign policy deserve some credit a little but not a whole lot we find ourselves in a position where we're more isolated in the world than we've ever been our allies are uh our goat alone our you know america first has made america alone you have iran closer to having enough nuclear material to build a bomb north korea has more bombs and missiles available to it we find ourselves where our nato allies are publicly saying they can't count on us we're in a situation as well where in the far east we find ourselves in in the in the in the western pacific where we're isolated as well you have japan and uh and and south korea at odds with china is making moves so i you know i would say we find ourselves less secure than we've been i do compliment the president on the deal with with israel recently um but uh you know uh if you take a look we're not very well trusted around the world when 17 major nations in the world were asked who they trust more who's the better leader and the president came in behind both the national survey international survey both behind putin as well as she and look what putin's doing you know you have americans bounties on american military's heads in afghanistan there are more people there now by the way than when i left when we left in afghanistan and we find ourselves in a situation where he's talked to putin six times hadn't said a word to him and nato is on the risk of beginning to crack because they don't doubt they doubt our concern whether we're there you see what's happening in everything from belarus to poland to uh to hungary and the rise of totalitarian regimes in the world and as well as this president embraces all the thugs in the world i mean he's best friends with the leader of north korea sending love letters he he doesn't take on putin in any way and he uh he has just uh he's learned the art of the steel from the art of the deal by she and china so i i would respectfully suggest no there is no plan no coherent plan foreign policy you know we've always ruled uh we've been most effective as a world leader in my humble opinion not just by the exercise of our power the most powerful nation in the world but the power of our example that's what's led the rest of the world to follow us on almost everything he's pulled out of almost every international organization he gets laughed at when he goes to the literally not figuratively when he goes to the united nations i mean it's just not it's not about the president per se it's about the nation and the lack of respect that's shown to us i want to get one more question in this segment it comes from mika hack she's from state college pennsylvania this is your first presidential election that you're voting yes hi thank you how are you i'm good thank you i'm the proud mom of two girls eight and ten my youngest daughter is transgender the trump administration has attacked the rights of transgender people banning them from military service weakening non-discrimination protections and even removing the word transgender from some government websites how will you as president reverse this dangerous and discriminatory agenda and ensure that the lives and rights of lgbtq people are protected under u.s law i will flat out just change the law every eliminate those executive orders number one you may recall i'm the guy who said i was raised by a man who i remember i was being dropped off my my dad was a high school educated well-read man who was a really decent guy and i was being dropped off to get an application in the center of our city wilmington delaware the corporate capital of the world at the time and these two men i'm getting out to get a an application to be a lifeguard in the african-american community because there was a big swimming pool complex and uh and these two men well-dressed leaned up and hugged one and kissed one another i'm getting out of the car at the light and i turned to my dad my dad looked at me said joey it's simple they love each other the idea that an eight-year-old child or a ten-year-old child decides you know i decided i want to be transgender that's what i think i'd like to be make my life a lot easier there should be zero discrimination and what's happening is too many transgender women of color are being murdered they're being murdered and i mean i think it's up to now 17 don't hold me to that number but it's it's incred it's higher now and that's just this year and so i promise you there is no reason to suggest that there should be any right denied your daughter or daughters whichever one or two one one your daughter that your other daughter has a right to be and do none zero and by the way my son beau passed away was the attorney general of the state of delaware he was the guy who got the first transgender law passed in the state of delaware and because of a young man who became a woman who worked for him in the attorney general's office we've got one more segment coming up thank you abc news straight forward with so much at stake so much on the line more americans turn here than any

friday night new interviews with those who were right there with john lennon and his last interview all on that day while there's life this hope the 2020 event yoko said what i tell you now is top secret you can't ever tell anyone john lennon his life his legacy his last days friday night on abc the vice president and the people a special edition of 2020 here again george stephanopoulos and welcome back to our town hall with former vice president joe biden the next question comes from keenan wilson norbert pennsylvania democrat thank you good uh good evening um you say that you committed to entering this race after the events of charlottesville in 2017. i assume that that feeling that prompted you to run will not go away once the results are determined so hypothetically if you lose how will you use your platform to urge president donald trump and those rallying behind him towards the ideals of a more perfect union well to be very honest with you i think that's very hard he is not things have not let themselves to him learning from what's happened what's gone before instead of being chastened by being one of the few presidents the only president to be impeached and then have a member of his own party vote to expel him and embolden him so but what i will do i will hopefully i'll go back to being a professor at the university of pennsylvania and making the case that i've been made and at the biden institute at the university of delaware focusing on on these same issues relating to what constitutes decency and honor in this country it's the thing that got me involved in public life to begin with as a kid i moved from scranton where there were no african-americans and moved down to clemont delaware and and in delaware we have the eighth largest black population as a percent of population it was an epiphany for me seeing what was going on and i got deeply involved i know great shakes i don't mean i'm i wasn't john lewis i don't mean to imply that but it's the thing that's motivated my dad used to have an expression for real he said everyone's entitled to be treated with dignity everybody and it was real everybody is and so whether i'm a defeated candidate for president back teaching or i'm elected president it is a major element of everything that i'm about because it reflects who we are as a nation and it's what makes us this is every single solitary generation the dial has moved closer and closer and more and more to inclusion and we are a country that is a country of slaves who came here 400 years ago indigenous people and everyone else is an immigrant and we're a diverse country unless we are able to treat people equally we're just never going to meet our potential but i think the american people want to see that happen i think they're ready to see it happen and i'll tell you one thing if i'm elected president you will not hear me race pain you'll not hear me dividing you hear me trying to unify and unify with bring people together when i said i was running because i wanted to unify the country people said well there are the old days we better be able to do it again great we better be able to do it again mr vice president if you lose what will that say to you about where america is today well i could say i'm a lousy candidate and i didn't do a good job but i think i hope that it doesn't say that we are as racially ethnically and religiously at odds with one another as it appears the president wants us to be usually you know the president's in my view with all due respect has been divide and conquer the way he does better if he splits us there's division um and i think people need hope i think look george i've never been more optimistic about the prospects for this country than i am today and i really mean that i think the people are ready they understand what's at stake and it's not about democrat or republican if i get elected you know i'm going to be i'm running as a proud democrat but i'm going to be an american president i'm going to take care of those who voted against me as well as those who voted for me for real that's a presence too we've got to heal this nation because we have the greatest opportunity any country in the world to own the 21st century and we can't do it divide it one more break we'll be right back [Music] welcome to disney plus are you ready in and

146,bPiofmZGb8o,biden,2020-10-22T00:00:00Z,Debate 2 (Biden),speech,"220,000 Americans dead. You hear nothing else I say tonight, hear this. Anyone who is responsible for not taking control. In fact, not saying I take no responsibility initially. Anyone is responsible for that many deaths should not remain as president of the United States of America. We're in a situation where there are a thousand deaths a day now. A thousand deaths a day. And there are over 70,000 new cases per day. Compared to what's going on in Europe as the New England Medical Journal said, they're starting from a very low rate. We're starting from a very high rate. The expectation is we'll have another 200,000 Americans dead between now and the end of the year. If we just wore these masks, the president's own advisors have told him, we can save a 100,000 lives. And we're in a circumstance where the president thus far and still has no plan, no comprehensive plan. What I would do is make sure we have everyone encouraged to wear a mask all the time. I would make sure we move into the direction of rapid testing, investing in rapid testing. I would make sure that we set up national standards as to how to open up schools and open up businesses so they can be safe and give them the wherewithal, the financial resources to be able to do that. We're in a situation now where the New England Medical Journal, one of the serious, most serious journals in the whole world said for the first time ever that the way this president has responded to this crisis has been absolutely tragic. And so folks, I will take care of this. I will end this. I will make sure we have a plan. Make sure it's totally transparent. Have the scientists of the world see it, know it, look at it, go through all the processes. And by the way, this is the same fellow who told you, ""This is going to end by Easter"" last time. This is the same fellow who told you that, ""Don't worry, we're going to end this by the summer."" We're about to go into a dark winter, a dark winter and he has no clear plan. And there's no prospect that there's going to be a vaccine available for the majority of the American people before the middle of next year. My response is he is xenophobic, but not because he shutdown access from China. And he did it late after 40 countries had already done that. In addition to that, what he did, he made sure that we had 44 people that were in there in China trying to get the Wuhan to determine what exactly the source was. What did the president say in January? He said, "" No."" He said, ""He's being transparent. The president of China is being transparent. We owe him a debt of gratitude. We have to thank him."" And then what happened was we started talking about using the Defense Act to make sure we go out and get whatever is needed out there to protect people. And again, I go back to this. He had nothing, he did virtually nothing. And then he gets out of the hospital and he talks about, ""Oh, don't worry. It's all going to be over soon."" Come on. There's not another serious scientist in the world who thinks it's going to be over soon. Can I respond to that? Number one, he says that we're learning to live with it. People are learning to die with it. You folks home will have an empty chair at the kitchen table this morning. That man or wife going to bed tonight and reaching over to try to touch, there out of habit, where their wife or husband was, is gone. Learning to live with it. Come on. We're dying with it, because he's never said. See, you said, ""It's dangerous."" When's the last time? Is it really dangerous still? Are we dangerous. You tell the people it's dangerous now. What should they do about the danger? And you say, ""I take no responsibility."" The fact is that when we knew it was coming, when it hit, what happened? What did the President say? He said, ""Don't worry. It's going to go away. It'll be gone by Easter. Don't worry. Warm weather. Don't worry. Maybe inject bleach."" He said he was kidding when he said that, but a lot of people thought it was serious. A whole range of things the President has said, even today, he thinks we are in control. We're about to lose 200,000 more people. I didn't say either of those things. I talked about his xenophobia in a different context. It wasn't about closing the border to Chinese coming to the United States. No. What I would say is, I'm going to shut down the virus, not the country. It's his ineptitude that caused the country to have to shut down in large part, why businesses have gone under, why schools are closed, why so many people have lost their living, and why they're concerned. Those other concerns are real. That's why he should have been, instead of in a sand trap at his golf course, he should have been negotiating with Nancy Pelosi and the rest of the Democrats and Republicans about what to do about the acts they were passing for billions of dollars to make sure people had the capacity. Oh, well, no. I'm not shutting down today, but there are ... Look, you need standards. The standard is, if you have a reproduction rate in a community that's above a certain level, everybody says, ""Slow up. More social distancing. Do not open bars and do not open gymnasiums. Do not open until you get this under control, under more control."" But when you do open, give the people the capacity to be able to open and have the capacity to do it safely. For example, schools. Schools, they need a lot of money to be open. They need to deal with ventilation systems. They need to deal with smaller classes, more teachers, more pods, and he's refused to support that money, or at least up to now. Simply not true. We ought to be able to walk and chew gum at the same time. We ought to be able to safely open, but they need resources to open? You need to be able to, for example, if you're going to open a business, have social distancing within the business. You need to have, if you have a restaurant, you need to have plexiglass dividers so people cannot infect one another. You need to be in a position where you can take testing rapidly and know whether the person is in fact infected. You need to be able to trace. You need to be able to provide all the resources that are needed to do this. And that is not inconsistent with saying that we're going to make sure that we're going to open safely. And by the way, all you teachers out there, not that many of you are going to die, so don't worry about it. So don't worry about it. Come on. Take a look at what New York has done in terms of turning the curve down, in terms of the number of people dying. And I don't look at this in terms of the way he does, blue states and red states. They're all the United States. And look at the states that are having such a spike in the coronavirus. They're the red states, they're the states in the Midwest, they're the states in the upper Midwest. That's where the spike is occurring significantly. But they're all Americans. They're all Americans. And what we have to do is say, wear these masks, number one. Make sure we get the help that the businesses need. That money's already been passed to do that. It's been out there since the beginning of the summer, and nothing's happened. My response is that think about what the President knew in January and didn't tell the American people. He was told this was a serious virus that spread in the air, and it was much worse, much worse, than the flu. He went on record and said to one of your colleagues, recorded, that in fact he knew how dangerous it was but he didn't want to tell us. He didn't want to tell us because he didn't want us to panic. He didn't want us... Americans don't panic. He panicked. But guess what, in the meantime, we find out in the New York Times the other day, that in fact his folks went to Wall Street and said, ""This is a really dangerous thing."" And a memo out of that meeting — not from his administration, but from some of the brokers — said, ""Sell short, because we've got to get moving. It's a dangerous problem."" I haven't- Average contribution, $43. I made it clear and I asked everyone else to take the pledge. I made it clear that any country, no matter who it is, that interferes in American elections will pay a price. They will pay a price. And it's been overwhelmingly clear this election — I won't even get into the last one — this election, that Russia has been involved, China's been involved to some degree, and now we learn that Iran is involved. They will pay a price if I'm elected. They're interfering with American sovereignty. That's what's going on right now. They're interfering with American sovereignty. And to the best of my knowledge, I don't think the President has said anything to Putin about it. I don't think he's talking to them a lot. I don't think he's said a word. I don't know why he hasn't said a word to Putin about it, and I don't know what he has recently said, if anything, to the Iranians. My guess is he'd probably be more outspoken with regard to the Iranians. But the point is this, folks. We are in a situation where we have foreign countries trying to interfere in the outcome of our election. His own National Security Advisor told him that what is happening with his buddy... Well, I shouldn't... Well, I will. His buddy Rudy Giuliani. He's being used as a Russian pawn. He's being fed information that is Russian that is not true. And then what happens? Nothing happens. And then you find out that everything that's going on here, about Russia is wanting to make sure that I do not get elected the next President of the United States, because they know I know them, and they know me. I don't understand why this President is unwilling to take on Putin when he's actually paying bounties to kill American soldiers in Afghanistan, when he's engaged in activities that are trying to destabilize all of NATO. I don't know why he doesn't do it, but it's worth asking the question. Why isn't that being done? Any country that interferes with us will, in fact, pay a price, because they're affecting our sovereignty. [crosstalk 00:01:31]. I have not taken a penny from any foreign source ever in my life. We learned that this president paid 50 times the tax in China as a secret bank account with China, does business in China, and in fact, is talking about me taking money? I have not taken a single penny from any country, whatsoever, ever, number one. Number two, this is a president... I have released all of my tax returns, 22 years, go look at them, 22 years of my tax return. You have not released a single solitary year of your tax return. What are you hiding? Why are you unwilling? The foreign countries are paying you a lot. Russia's paying you a lot. China's paying you a lot on your hotels and all your businesses all around the country, all around the world. And China's building a new road to a new golf course you have overseas. So, what's going on here? Release your tax return or stop talking about corruption. I have to respond to that. Why did he... he's been saying this for four years, show us, just show us, stop playing around. You've been saying for four years you're going to release your taxes. Nobody knows, Mr. President. What they do know is you're not paying your taxes, or you're paying taxes that are so low, when last time he said, what he paid, he said, I only pay that little because I'm smart. I know how to game the system. Come on. Come on, folks. Sure. Nothing was unethical. Here's what the deal. With regard to Ukraine. We had this whole question about whether or not, because he was on the board, I later learned of Burisma, a company that somehow, I had done something wrong, yet every single solitary person, when he was going through his impeachment, testifying under oath, who work for him, said I did my job impeccably. I carried out U.S. policy, not one single solitary thing was out of line, not a single thing, number one. Number two, the guy who got in trouble in Ukraine was this guy trying to bribe the Ukrainian government to say something negative about me, which they would not do and did not do because it never ever, ever happened. My son has not made money in terms of this thing about, what are you talking about, China. I have not had... the only guy who made money from China is this guy. He's the only one. Nobody else has made money from China. No basis for that. Everybody investigated that. No one said anything he did was wrong in Ukraine. Not true. What I'd make China do is play by the international rules, not like he has done. He has caused the deficit of the China to go up, not down, with China, up, not down. We are making sure that in order to do business in China, you have to give all your intellectual property. You have to have a partner in China. It's 51%, we would not do that at all, number one. Number two, we're in a situation where China would have to play by the rules internationally as well. When I met with Xi and when I was still vice-president, he said we're setting up air identification zones in the South China Sea. You can't fly through them. I said we're going to fly through them. We just flew B-52, B-1 bombers through it. We're not going to pay attention. They have to play by the rules. And what's he do? He embraces guys like the thugs, like in North Korea and the Chinese president and Putin and others, and he pokes his finger [inaudible 00:10:36] all of our friends, all of our allies. We make up only... we're 25%, 25% of the world's economy. We need to be having the rest of our friends with us saying to China, ""These are the rules. You play by them, or you're going to pay the price for not paying by them economically."" That's the way I will run it, and that's what we did and upholding steel tariffs and a range of other things when we were president and vice-president. ... and Vice President. Not true. That's not true. Tax payer's money. Taxpayer's money. Didn't come from China. Not true. My response is, look, there's a reason why he's bringing up all this malarkey. There's a reason for it. He doesn't want to talk about the substantive issues. It's not about his family and my family. It's about your family, and your family's hurting badly. If you're a middle-class family, you're getting hurt badly right now. You're sitting at the kitchen table this morning deciding, ""Well, we can't get new tires. They're bald, because we have to wait another month or so."" Or, ""Are we going to be able to pay the mortgage?"" Or, ""Who's going to tell her she can't go back to community college?"" They're the decisions you're making, and the middle-class families like I grew up in Scranton and Claymont, they're in trouble. We should be talking about your families, but that's the last thing he wants to talk about. I want to talk about North Korea. Because I'd make it clear, which we were making clear to China, they had to be part of the deal, because I made it clear as a spokesperson for the illustration when I went to China that I said, ""Why are you moving your missile defense up so close? Why are you moving more forces here? Why are you continue to do military maneuvers with South Korea?"" I said, ""Because North Korea is a problem, and we're going to continue to do it so we can control them. We're going to make sure we can control them and make sure they can not hurt us. And so if you want to do something about it, step up and help. If not, it's going to continue."" What has he done? He's legitimized North Korea. He's talked about his good buddy, who's a thug, a thug. And he talks about how we're better off. And they have much more capable missiles, able to reach us territory much more easily than they ever did before. On the condition that he would agree that he would be drawing down his nuclear capacity. The Korean Peninsula should be a nuclear free zone. We had a good relationship with Hitler before he, in fact, invaded Europe, the rest of Europe. Come on. The reason he would not meet with President Obama is because President Obama said, ""We're going to talk about denuclearization. We're not going to legitimize you and we're going to continue to push stronger and stronger sanctions on you."" That's why he wouldn't meet with us. What I'm going to do is pass Obamacare with a public option, and become Bidencare. The public option is an option that says that if you in fact do not have the wherewithal, if you qualify for Medicaid and you do not have the wherewithal in your state to get Medicaid, you automatically are enrolled, providing competition for insurance companies. That's what's going to happen. Secondly, we're going to make sure we reduce the premiums and reduce drug prices by making sure that there's competition, that doesn't exist now, by allowing Medicare to negotiate drug prices with the insurance companies. Thirdly, the idea that I want to eliminate private insurance, the reason why I had such a fight with 20 candidates for the nomination was I support private insurance. That's why. Not one single person with private insurance would lose their insurance under my plan, nor did they under Obamacare. They did not lose their insurance unless they chose they wanted to go to something else. Lastly, we're going to make sure we're in a situation that we actually protect pre-existing. There's no way he can protect pre-existing conditions. None, zero. You can't do it in the ether. He's been talking about this for a long time. He's never come up with a plan. I guess we're going to get the pre-existing condition plan the same time we got the infrastructure plan that we waited for since '17, '18, '19, and 20. I still have a few more minutes. I know you're getting anxious. The fact is that he's already cost the American people, because of his terrible handling of the COVID virus and economic spillover. 10 million people have lost their private insurance, and he wants to take away 22 million more people who have it under Obamacare and over 110 million people with pre-existing conditions. And all the people from COVID are going to have pre-existing conditions, what are they going to do? I say it's ridiculous. It's like saying that the fact that there's a public option that people can choose, that makes it a socialist plan. Look, the difference between the president and I... I think healthcare is not a privilege, it's a right. Everyone should have the right to have affordable healthcare, and I am very proud of my plan. It's gotten endorsed by all the major labor unions, as well as a whole range of other people who, in fact, are concerned in the medical field. This is something that's going to save people's lives. And this is going to give some people an opportunity to have healthcare for their children. How many of you at home are worried and rolling around in bed tonight, wondering what in God's name you're going to do if you get sick, because you've lost your health insurance and your company's gone under? We have to provide health insurance for people at an affordable rate, and that's what I do. By the way- You can ask it. I have to respond to healthcare. My response is, people deserve to have affordable healthcare, period. Period, period, period. And the Biden care proposal will in fact provide for that affordable healthcare, lower premiums. What we're going to do is going to cost some money. It's going to cost over $750 billion over 10 years to do it. And they're going to have lower premiums. You can buy into the better plans, the cheaper plans, lower your premiums, deal with unexpected billing, and have your drug prices drop significantly. He keeps talking about it. He hasn't done a thing for anybody on healthcare. Not a thing. Wrong. Bernie. He's a very confused guy. He thinks he's running against somebody else. He's running against Joe Biden. I beat all those other people because I disagreed with them. Joe Biden, he's running against. And the idea that we're in a situation that is going to destroy Medicare... This is the guy that the actuary of Medicare said, ""If in fact..."" That's Social Security. ""If in fact he continues his plan to withhold the tax on Social Security, Social Security will be bankrupt by 2023 with no way to make up for it."" This is the guy who's tried to cut Medicare. The idea that Donald Trump is lecturing me on Social Security and Medicare? Come on. May I respond? Look, the idea that the stock market is booming is his only measure of what's happening. Where I come from in Scranton and Claymont, the people don't live off of the stock market. Just in the last three years, during this crisis, the billionaires in this country made, according to Wall Street, 700 billion more dollars. 700 billion more dollars. Because that's his only measure. What happens to the ordinary people out there? What happens to them? By the way, as you know, the Republican leader in the United States Senate said he can't pass it. He will be able to pass it. He does not have Republican votes. Why isn't he talking to his Republican friends? I have, and they have pushed it. Look, they passed this act all the way back in the beginning of the summer. It's not new. It's been out there. This HEROES Act has been sitting there. And look at what's happening. When I was in charge of the recovery act with $800 billion, I was able to get $145 billion to local communities that have to balance their budgets and states that have to balance their budgets. And then they have to fire firefighters, teachers, first responders, law enforcement officers, so they could keep their cities and counties running. He will not support that. They have not done a thing for them. And Mitch McConnell said, ""Let them go bankrupt. Let them go bankrupt."" Come on. What's the matter with these guys? By the way, if I get elected, I'm not going to... I'm running as a proud Democrat, but I'm going to be an American president. I don't see red states and blue states. What I see is American United States. And folks, every single state out there finds themself in trouble. They're going to start laying off, whether they're red or blue, cops, firefighters, first responders, teachers, because they have to balance their budget. And the founders were smart. They allowed the federal government to deficit spend to compensate for the United States of America. I do, because I think one of the things we're going to have to do is we're going to have to bail them out too. We should be bailing them out now, those small businesses. You got one in six of them going under. They're not going to be able to make it back. They passed a package that allows us to be able... They call it PPP. Money is supposed to go to help them do everything from organize how they can deal with their businesses being open safely, schools, how they can make classrooms smaller, how they can hire more teachers, how they can put ventilation systems in. They need the help. The businesses, as well as the schools, need the help. These guys will not help them. It's not giving them any of the money. Not true, by the way. Every- No one should work one job, be below poverty. People are making six, seven, eight bucks an hour. These first responders we all clap for as they come down the street because they've allowed us to make it. What's happening? They deserve a minimum wage of $15. Anything below that puts you below the poverty level. And there is no evidence that when you raise the minimum wage, businesses go out of business. That is simply not true. It's an [crosstalk 00:32:35]- These 500-plus kids came with parents. They separated them at the border to make it a disincentive to come to begin with. ""Be real tough. We're really strong."" And guess what? They cannot... Coyotes didn't bring them over. Their parents were with them. They got separated from their parents. And it makes us a laughingstock and violates every notion of who we are as a nation. We did not separate the [crosstalk 00:34:25]- Let's talk about what we're talking about. Let's talk about what we're talking about. What happened? Parents were ripped... Their kids were ripped from their arms and separated, and now they cannot find over 500 of the sets of those parents, and those kids are alone. Nowhere to go. Nowhere to go. It's criminal. It's criminal. Because we made a mistake made. It took too long to get it right. Took too long to get it right. I'll be President of the United States, not Vice President of the United States. And the fact is I've made it very clear. Within a 100 days, I'm going to send to the United States Congress a pathway to citizenship for over 11 million undocumented people. And all of those so-called dreamers, those DACA kids, they're going to be immediately certified again to be able to stay in this country and put on a path to citizenship. The idea that they are being sent home by this guy and they want to do that is they've gone to they've never seen before. I can imagine. You're five years old. Your parents are taking across the Rio Grande River and it's illegal. And you say, ""Oh, no, Mom. Leave me here. I'm not going to go with you."" They been here. Many of them are model citizens. Over 20,000 of them are first responders out there taking care of people during this crisis. We owe them. We owe them. The catch and release, you know what he's talking about there? If in fact you had a family came across and they were arrested, they in fact were given a date to show up for their hearing. They were released. And guess what? They showed up for a hearing. And this is the first President in the history of the United States of America that anybody seeking asylum has to do it in another country. That's never happened before in America. That's never happened before in America. You come to the United States and you make your case that, ""I seek asylum based on the following premise, why I deserve it under American law."" They're sitting in squalor on the other side of the river. Know the law, what he's telling you is simply not true. Check it out. Check it out. That's right. And you 525 kids not knowing where in God's name they're going to be and lost their parents. I do. I do. My daughter is a social worker and she's written a lot about this. She has her graduate degree from the University of Pennsylvania in social work. And one of the reasons why I ended up working on the East Side of Wilmington, Delaware, which is 90% African-American, was to learn more about what was going on. I never had to tell my daughter if she's pulled over, make sure she puts... For a traffic stop. ""Put both hands on top of the wheel and don't reach for the glove box because someone may shoot you."" But a Black parent, no matter how wealthy or how poor they are, has to teach their child, ""When you're walking down the street, don't have a hoodie on when you go across the street. Making sure that you, in fact, if you get pulled over just, ""Yes, sir. No-",b americans dead PRON hear nothing else i say tonight hear this anyone who be responsible for not take control in fact not say i take no responsibility initially anyone be responsible for that many death should not remain as president of the united states of america we re in a situation where there be a thousand death a day now a thousand death a day and there be over new case per day compare to what be go on in europe as the new england medical journal say they re start from a very low rate we re start from a very high rate the expectation be we ll have another americans dead between now and the end of the year if PRON just wear these mask the president own advisor have tell PRON PRON can save a life and we re in a circumstance where the president thus far and still have no plan no comprehensive plan what i would do be make sure PRON have everyone encourage to wear a mask all the time i would make sure PRON move into the direction of rapid testing invest in rapid testing i would make sure that PRON set up national standard as to how to open up school and open up business so PRON can be safe and give PRON the wherewithal the financial resource to be able to do that we re in a situation now where the new england medical journal one of the serious most serious journal in the whole world say for the first time ever that the way this president have respond to this crisis have be absolutely tragic and so folk i will take care of this i will end this i will make sure PRON have a plan make sure it totally transparent have the scientist of the world see PRON know PRON look at PRON go through all the process and by the way this be the same fellow who tell PRON this be go to end by easter last time this be the same fellow who tell PRON that don t worry we re go to end this by the summer we re about to go into a dark winter a dark winter and PRON have no clear plan and there be no prospect that there be go to be a vaccine available for the majority of the american people before the middle of next year PRON response be PRON be xenophobic but not because PRON shutdown access from china and PRON do PRON late after country have already do that in addition to that what PRON do PRON make sure that PRON have people that be in there in china try to get the wuhan to determine what exactly the source be what do the president say in january PRON say no PRON say he be transparent the president of china be be transparent PRON owe PRON a debt of gratitude PRON have to thank PRON and then what happen be PRON start talk about use the defense act to make sure PRON go out and get whatever be need out there to protect people and again i go back to this PRON have nothing PRON do virtually nothing and then PRON get out of the hospital and PRON talk about oh don t worry it be all go to be over soon come on there be not another serious scientist in the world who think it be go to be over soon can i respond to that number one PRON say that we re learn to live with PRON people be learn to die with PRON PRON folk home will have an empty chair at the kitchen table this morning that man or wife go to bed tonight and reach over to try to touch there out of habit where PRON wife or husband be be go learn to live with PRON come on we re die with PRON because he never say see PRON say it dangerous when be the last time be PRON really dangerous still be PRON dangerous PRON tell the people it dangerous now what should PRON do about the danger and PRON say i take no responsibility the fact be that when PRON know PRON be come when PRON hit what happen what do the president say PRON say don t worry it be go to go away it ll be go by easter don t worry warm weather don t worry maybe inject bleach PRON say PRON be kid when PRON say that but a lot of people think PRON be serious a whole range of thing the president have say even today PRON think PRON be in control we re about to lose more people i didn t say either of those thing i talk about PRON xenophobia in a different context PRON wasn t about close the border to chinese come to the united states no what i would say be i m go to shut down the virus not the country it PRON ineptitude that cause the country to have to shut down in large part why business have go under why school be closed why so many people have lose PRON living and why they re concerned those other concern be real that be why PRON should have be instead of in a sand trap at PRON golf course PRON should have be negotiate with nancy pelosi and the rest of the democrats and republicans about what to do about the act PRON be pass for billion of dollar to make sure people have the capacity oh well no i m not shut down today but there be look PRON need standard the standard be if PRON have a reproduction rate in a community that be above a certain level everybody say slow up more social distancing do not open bar and do not open gymnasium do not open until PRON get this under control under more control but when PRON do open give the people the capacity to be able to open and have the capacity to do PRON safely for example school school PRON need a lot of money to be open PRON need to deal with ventilation system PRON need to deal with small class more teacher more pod and he refuse to support that money or at least up to now simply not true PRON ought to be able to walk and chew gum at the same time PRON ought to be able to safely open but PRON need resource to open PRON need to be able to for example if you re go to open a business have social distancing within the business PRON need to have if PRON have a restaurant PRON need to have plexiglass divider so people can not infect one another PRON need to be in a position where PRON can take testing rapidly and know whether the person be in fact infect PRON need to be able to trace PRON need to be able to provide all the resource that be need to do this and that be not inconsistent with say that we re go to make sure that we re go to open safely and by the way all PRON teacher out there not that many of PRON be go to die so don t worry about PRON so don t worry about PRON come on take a look at what new york have do in term of turn the curve down in term of the number of people die and i don t look at this in term of the way PRON do blue state and red state they re all the united states and look at the state that be have such a spike in the coronavirus they re the red state they re the state in the midwest they re the state in the upper midwest that be where the spike be occur significantly but they re all americans they re all americans and what PRON have to do be say wear these mask number one make sure PRON get the help that the business need that money be already be pass to do that it be be out there since the beginning of the summer and nothing happen PRON response be that think about what the president know in january and didn t tell the american people PRON be tell this be a serious virus that spread in the air and PRON be much bad much bad than the flu PRON go on record and say to one of PRON colleague record that in fact PRON know how dangerous PRON be but PRON didn t want to tell PRON PRON didn t want to tell PRON because PRON didn t want PRON to panic PRON didn t want PRON americans don t panic PRON panic but guess what in the meantime PRON find out in the new york times the other day that in fact PRON folk go to wall street and say this be a really dangerous thing and a memo out of that meeting not from PRON administration but from some of the broker say sell short because we ve get to get move it be a dangerous problem i haven t average contribution $ i make PRON clear and i ask everyone else to take the pledge i make PRON clear that any country no matter who PRON be that interfere in american election will pay a price PRON will pay a price and it be be overwhelmingly clear this election i won t even get into the last one this election that russia have be involve china be be involve to some degree and now PRON learn that iran be involve PRON will pay a price if i m elect they re interfere with american sovereignty that what be go on right now they re interfere with american sovereignty and to the good of PRON knowledge i don t think the president have say anything to putin about PRON i don t think he be talk to PRON a lot i don t think he say a word i don t know why PRON hasn t say a word to putin about PRON and i don t know what PRON have recently say if anything to the iranians PRON guess be he d probably be more outspoken with regard to the iranians but the point be this folk PRON be in a situation where PRON have foreign country try to interfere in the outcome of PRON election PRON own national security advisor tell PRON that what be happen with PRON buddy well i shouldn t well i will PRON buddy rudy giuliani he be use as a russian pawn he be feed information that be russian that be not true and then what happen nothing happen and then PRON find out that everything that be go on here about russia be want to make sure that i do not get elect the next president of the united states because PRON know i know PRON and PRON know PRON i don t understand why this president be unwilling to take on putin when he actually pay bounty to kill american soldier in afghanistan when he engage in activity that be try to destabilize all of nato i don t know why PRON doesn t do PRON but it worth ask the question why isn t that be do any country that interfere with PRON will in fact pay a price because they re affect PRON sovereignty crosstalk i have not take a penny from any foreign source ever in PRON life PRON learn that this president pay time the tax in china as a secret bank account with china do business in china and in fact be talk about PRON take money i have not take a single penny from any country whatsoever ever number one number two this be a president i have release all of PRON tax return year go look at PRON year of PRON tax return PRON have not release a single solitary year of PRON tax return what be PRON hide why be PRON unwilling the foreign country be pay PRON a lot russia be pay PRON a lot china pay PRON a lot on PRON hotel and all PRON business all around the country all around the world and china build a new road to a new golf course PRON have overseas so what be go on here release PRON tax return or stop talk about corruption i have to respond to that why do PRON he be be say this for four year show PRON just show PRON stop play around you ve be say for four year you re go to release PRON taxis nobody know mr president what PRON do know be you re not pay PRON taxis or you re pay taxis that be so low when last time PRON say what PRON pay PRON say i only pay that little because i m smart i know how to game the system come on come on folk sure nothing be unethical here be what the deal with regard to ukraine PRON have this whole question about whether or not because PRON be on the board i later learn of burisma a company that somehow i have do something wrong yet every single solitary person when PRON be go through PRON impeachment testify under oath who work for PRON say i do PRON job impeccably i carry out u s policy not one single solitary thing be out of line not a single thing number one number two the guy who get in trouble in ukraine be this guy try to bribe the ukrainian government to say something negative about PRON which PRON would not do and do not do because PRON never ever ever happen PRON son have not make money in term of this thing about what be PRON talk about china i have not have the only guy who make money from china be this guy he be the only one nobody else have make money from china no basis for that everybody investigate that no one say anything PRON do be wrong in ukraine not true what i d make china do be play by the international rule not like PRON have do PRON have cause the deficit of the china to go up not down with china up not down PRON be make sure that in order to do business in china PRON have to give all PRON intellectual property PRON have to have a partner in china it PRON would not do that at all number one number two we re in a situation where china would have to play by the rule internationally as well when i meet with xi and when i be still vice president PRON say we re set up air identification zone in the south china sea PRON can t fly through PRON i say we re go to fly through PRON PRON just fly b b bomber through PRON we re not go to pay attention PRON have to play by the rule and what be PRON do PRON embrace guy like the thug like in north korea and the chinese president and putin and other and PRON poke PRON finger inaudible all of PRON friend all of PRON ally PRON make up only we re of the world economy PRON need to be have the rest of PRON friend with PRON say to china these be the rule PRON play by PRON or you re go to pay the price for not pay by PRON economically that be the way i will run PRON and that be what PRON do and uphold steel tariff and a range of other thing when PRON be president and vice president and vice president not true that be not true tax payer money taxpayer money didn t come from china not true PRON response be look there be a reason why he bring up all this malarkey there be a reason for PRON PRON doesn t want to talk about the substantive issue it be not about PRON family and PRON family it be about PRON family and PRON family hurting badly if you re a middle class family you re get hurt badly right now you re sit at the kitchen table this morning decide well PRON can t get new tire they re bald because PRON have to wait another month or so or be PRON go to be able to pay the mortgage or who be go to tell PRON PRON can t go back to community college they re the decision you re make and the middle class family like i grow up in scranton and claymont they re in trouble PRON should be talk about PRON family but that be the last thing PRON want to talk about i want to talk about north korea because i d make PRON clear which PRON be make clear to china PRON have to be part of the deal because i make PRON clear as a spokesperson for the illustration when i go to china that i say why be PRON move PRON missile defense up so close why be PRON move more force here why be PRON continue to do military maneuver with south korea i say because north korea be a problem and we re go to continue to do PRON so PRON can control PRON we re go to make sure PRON can control PRON and make sure PRON can not hurt PRON and so if PRON want to do something about PRON step up and help if not it be go to continue what have PRON do he legitimize north korea he talk about PRON good buddy who be a thug a thug and PRON talk about how we re better off and PRON have much more capable missile able to reach PRON territory much more easily than PRON ever do before on the condition that PRON would agree that PRON would be draw down PRON nuclear capacity the korean peninsula should be a nuclear free zone PRON have a good relationship with hitler before PRON in fact invade europe the rest of europe come on the reason PRON would not meet with president obama be because president obama say we re go to talk about denuclearization we re not go to legitimize PRON and we re go to continue to push strong and strong sanction on PRON that be why PRON wouldn t meet with PRON what i m go to do be pass obamacare with a public option and become bidencare the public option be an option that say that if PRON in fact do not have the wherewithal if PRON qualify for medicaid and PRON do not have the wherewithal in PRON state to get medicaid PRON automatically be enrol provide competition for insurance company that what be go to happen secondly we re go to make sure PRON reduce the premium and reduce drug price by make sure that there competition that doesn t exist now by allow medicare to negotiate drug price with the insurance company thirdly the idea that i want to eliminate private insurance the reason why i have such a fight with candidate for the nomination be i support private insurance that be why not one single person with private insurance would lose PRON insurance under PRON plan nor do PRON under obamacare PRON do not lose PRON insurance unless PRON choose PRON want to go to something else lastly we re go to make sure we re in a situation that PRON actually protect pre existing there be no way PRON can protect pre existing condition none zero PRON can t do PRON in the ether he be be talk about this for a long time he be never come up with a plan i guess we re go to get the pre exist condition plan the same time PRON get the infrastructure plan that PRON wait for since and i still have a few more minute i know you re get anxious the fact be that he already cost the american people because of PRON terrible handling of the covid virus and economic spillover million people have lose PRON private insurance and PRON want to take away million more people who have PRON under obamacare and over million people with pre existing condition and all the people from covid be go to have pre existing condition what be PRON go to do i say it ridiculous it like say that the fact that there be a public option that people can choose that make PRON a socialist plan look the difference between the president and i i think healthcare be not a privilege it be a right everyone should have the right to have affordable healthcare and i be very proud of PRON plan it get endorse by all the major labor union as well as a whole range of other people who in fact be concern in the medical field this be something that be go to save people life and this be go to give some people an opportunity to have healthcare for PRON child how many of PRON at home be worried and roll around in bed tonight wonder what in god name you re go to do if PRON get sick because you ve lose PRON health insurance and PRON company be go under PRON have to provide health insurance for people at an affordable rate and that be what i do by the way PRON can ask PRON i have to respond to healthcare PRON response be people deserve to have affordable healthcare period period period period and the biden care proposal will in fact provide for that affordable healthcare low premium what we re go to do be go to cost some money it be go to cost over $ billion over year to do PRON and they re go to have low premium PRON can buy into the well plan the cheap plan lower PRON premium deal with unexpected billing and have PRON drug price drop significantly PRON keep talk about PRON PRON hasn t do a thing for anybody on healthcare not a thing wrong bernie he be a very confused guy PRON think he be run against somebody else he be run against joe biden i beat all those other people because i disagree with PRON joe biden he be run against and the idea that we re in a situation that be go to destroy medicare this be the guy that the actuary of medicare say if in fact that social security if in fact PRON continue PRON plan to withhold the tax on social security social security will be bankrupt by with no way to make up for PRON this be the guy who try to cut medicare the idea that donald trump be lecture PRON on social security and medicare come on may i respond look the idea that the stock market be boom be PRON only measure of what happening where i come from in scranton and claymont the people don t live off of the stock market just in the last three year during this crisis the billionaire in this country make accord to wall street billion more dollar billion more dollar because that be PRON only measure what happen to the ordinary people out there what happen to PRON by the way as PRON know the republican leader in the united states senate say PRON can t pass PRON PRON will be able to pass PRON PRON do not have republican vote why isn t PRON talk to PRON republican friend i have and PRON have push PRON look PRON pass this act all the way back in the beginning of the summer it be not new it be be out there this heroes act have be sit there and look at what happening when i be in charge of the recovery act with $ billion i be able to get $ billion to local community that have to balance PRON budget and state that have to balance PRON budget and then PRON have to fire firefighter teacher first responder law enforcement officer so PRON could keep PRON city and county run PRON will not support that PRON have not do a thing for PRON and mitch mcconnell say let PRON go bankrupt let PRON go bankrupt come on what be the matter with these guy by the way if i get elect i m not go to i m run as a proud democrat but i m go to be an american president i don t see red state and blue state what i see be american united states and folk every single state out there find PRON in trouble they re go to start lay off whether they re red or blue cop firefighter first responder teacher because PRON have to balance PRON budget and the founder be smart PRON allow the federal government to deficit spend to compensate for the united states of america i do because i think one of the thing we re go to have to do be we re go to have to bail PRON out too PRON should be bail PRON out now those small business PRON get one in six of PRON go under they re not go to be able to make PRON back PRON pass a package that allow PRON to be able PRON call PRON ppp money be suppose to go to help PRON do everything from organize how PRON can deal with PRON business be open safely school how PRON can make classroom small how PRON can hire more teacher how PRON can put ventilation system in PRON need the help the business as well as the school need the help these guy will not help PRON it be not give PRON any of the money not true by the way every no one should work one job be below poverty people be make six seven eight buck an hour these first responder PRON all clap for as PRON come down the street because they ve allow PRON to make PRON what be happen PRON deserve a minimum wage of $ anything below that put PRON below the poverty level and there be no evidence that when PRON raise the minimum wage business go out of business that be simply not true it be an crosstalk these plus kid come with parent PRON separate PRON at the border to make PRON a disincentive to come to begin with be real tough we re really strong and guess what PRON can not coyote didn t bring PRON over PRON parent be with PRON PRON get separate from PRON parent and PRON make PRON a laughingstock and violate every notion of who PRON be as a nation PRON do not separate the crosstalk let talk about what we re talk about let talk about what we re talk about what happen parent be rip PRON kid be rip from PRON arm and separate and now PRON can not find over of the set of those parent and those kid be alone nowhere to go nowhere to go it criminal it criminal because PRON make a mistake make PRON take too long to get PRON right take too long to get PRON right i ll be president of the united states not vice president of the united states and the fact be i ve make PRON very clear within a day i m go to send to the united states congress a pathway to citizenship for over million undocumented people and all of those so call dreamer those daca kid they re go to be immediately certify again to be able to stay in this country and put on a path to citizenship the idea that PRON be be send home by this guy and PRON want to do that be they ve go to they ve never see before i can imagine you re five year old PRON parent be take across the rio grande river and it illegal and PRON say oh no mom leave PRON here i m not go to go with PRON PRON be here many of PRON be model citizen over of PRON be first responder out there take care of people during this crisis PRON owe PRON PRON owe PRON the catch and release PRON know what he be talk about there if in fact PRON have a family come across and PRON be arrest PRON in fact be give a date to show up for PRON hearing PRON be release and guess what PRON show up for a hearing and this be the first president in the history of the united states of america that anybody seek asylum have to do PRON in another country that be never happen before in america that be never happen before in america PRON come to the united states and PRON make PRON case that i seek asylum base on the follow premise why i deserve PRON under american law they re sit in squalor on the other side of the river know the law what he tell PRON be simply not true check PRON out check PRON out that be right and PRON kid not know where in god name they re go to be and lose PRON parent i do i do PRON daughter be a social worker and she be write a lot about this PRON have PRON graduate degree from the university of pennsylvania in social work and one of the reason why i end up work on the east side of wilmington delaware which be african american be to learn more about what be go on i never have to tell PRON daughter if she be pull over make sure PRON put for a traffic stop put both hand on top of the wheel and don t reach for the glove box because someone may shoot PRON but a black parent no matter how wealthy or how poor PRON be have to teach PRON child when you re walk down the street don t have a hoodie on when PRON go across the street make sure that PRON in fact if PRON get pull over just yes sir no
149,VF6kAXnRMLs,biden,2020-10-23T19:22:09Z,Live: Biden Delivers Remarks on Coronavirus and the Economy | NBC News,speech,we saw him refuse to take responsibility for the crisis that should have been met with real presidential leadership instead it has cost hundreds of thousands of americans lives and pushed millions into poverty we saw him diminish the pain felt by so many americans president trump said we're rounding the corner it's going away we're learning to live with it there are quotes but as i told them last night we're not learning to live with it we're learning to die with it this is a dark winter ahead already more than 220 000 people in the united states of america have lost their lives to this virus 220 000 empty chairs at dinner tables all across this country my heart goes out to every single person who's had to endure the agony of saying goodbye to someone they loved and adored over a video chat who couldn't gather their closest friends even their full family to grieve together at a funeral mass or a funeral service and worse yet a new study from columbia university suggested anywhere between 130 000 and 210 000 of those deaths were avoidable leading medical journal in america quite frankly in the world wrote an unprecedented editorial to the best of my knowledge they've never written anything like this they criticized president trump's quote dangerously incompetent end of quote response and stated that he quote took a crisis and turned it into a tragedy culver 19 dwarfs anything we've faced in recent history and it isn't showing any signs of slowing down the virus is surging in almost every state we passed 4.8 million cases when trump was asked this week what he do differently to get the pandemic response right from the start his answer was and i quote not much not much as many as two hundred and ten thousand avoidable deaths but there's not much he would do differently the united states is four percent of the entire world's population yet we make up twenty percent of all the deaths worldwide if this is a success what's a failure look like we're more than eight months into this crisis and the president still doesn't have a plan he's given up he's quit on you he's quit on your family he's quit on america he just wants us to grow numb and resign to the horrors of this death toll and the pain is causing so many americans but he can't erase his own words or deeds in february he knew just how dangerous this virus was he told bob woodruin in a taped interview this disease was deadly far worse than the flu but instead of telling us how bad it was going to be according to the new york times his administration only gave wall street investors a head up heads up and they made a bundle doing something calling called selling short or betting against the market so wall street knew it was coming while the rest of us took the full brunt of it in june when we began to see the resurgence of covet 19 i called off president trump for wavering and waving the white flag of surrender to the virus but then it was as if he decided to go on offense for the virus holding rallies with no masks no social distancing where people contracted the virus inviting the virus into the white house hosting what dr fauci called super spreader event endangering more people's lives by telling the public don't worry don't worry about the disease don't let it dominate you how many people from christian in arizona will end up suffering because their loved one listened to the president kristen said her dad voted for trump listened to him believed him that the virus wasn't a big deal then her dad became infected and died christian said it was her dad's only pre-existing condition this is her quote the only pre-existing condition was trusting donald trump and the quote even after contracting the virus himself donald trump still still refuses to promote universal mass querying which could have saved nearly 100 000 lives and could still save over 100 000 lives in the next few months the longer donald trump is present the more reckless he gets we don't have to be held prisoner by this administration's failures we can choose a different path we can do what americans have always done come together and meet the challenge with grit compassion and determination and today i'm going to tell you exactly what i plan to do if i have the honor of being elected your next president i'll immediately put in place a national strategy that'll position our country to finally get ahead of this virus and get back our lives i'll reach out to every governor in every state red and blue as well as mayors and local officials during transition to find out what support they need and how much of it they need i'll ask the new congress to put a bill on my desk by the end of january with all the resources necessary to see how both our public health and our economic response can be seen through the end what is needed look a pandemic doesn't play favors nor will i as i said no red states no blue states just the united states united in our response united in our purpose to stop the spread of covet 19 and beat this virus first i'll go to every governor urge them to mandate mass wearing in their states and if they refuse i'll go to the mayors and county executives and get local masking requirements in place nationwide as president i'll mandate masquerade in all federal buildings and all interstate transportation because mass save lives period look what happened in arizona republican governor initially tried to bar local governments from implementing mandates on their communities what happened in june arizona got hit with a surge of cases hospitals were flooded the state health system was overwhelmed so cities and counties appealed the governor's ruling they imposed their own local mandates covering most of the state the result cases fell by 75 percent wearing a mask is not a political statement it's a scientific imperative it's a point of patriotic pride so we can pull our country out of this god awful spiral we're in and it's a testament to the values we were taught by our families and by our faiths love thy neighbor as thyself second i'll put a national testing plan in place with a goal of testing as many people each day as we're currently testing each week a seven fold increase there's a key difference in this campaign between donald trump and me i believe in testing donald trump does not i believe in science i believe in public health officials i believe in the example of other countries which prove that widespread testing is needed to regain the health of our nation to reopen safely and critically to stay open every school every worker every american should have easy access to regular reliable free testing to achieve this we need to increase both lab-based diagnostic testing with the results back within 24 hours or less and faster cheaper screening tests that you could take right at home or in school look what we have right now isn't anywhere near good enough states are still improvising on the fly school districts are still mostly on their own and many americans still don't know when it's important to get a test or how this isn't beyond our capacity to master not if we're directing a coordinated effort across government and the private sector instead of leaving chaos terrain we'll manufacture the lab supplies needed to make sure we have enough tests and we'll tap more of our nation's lab capacity so you can get your test results more quickly we'll build a national core of contact tracers to work closely with trusted organizations in these communities that are most at risk will also take steps to ensure that no one has to choose be between getting a test and putting food on the table look and that no one no one is scared that being tested for covet might jeopardize their immigration status the only way we'll defeat this virus is if we defeat it everywhere the third point i'd like to make is we'll close the personal protective equipment the ppe gap and get the gear out where it's needed every healthcare worker will have a reliable supply of properly fitted n95 mask it's unconscionable there are more than eight months into this crisis and frontline healthcare workers are still rationing their personal protective equipment as president i'll use the full power of the defense production act to drive the manufacturing of personal protective equipment masks gloves gowns and more and ensure that it's distributed equitably look we won't stop until the nation's supply exceeds the demand and our stockpile is replenished especially in hearted areas and in communities that are disproportionately impacted by the virus i will appoint a fully empowered i will appoint a fully empowered supply commander who's in charge of filling in the gaps we'll make sure we can manufacture critical supplies right here at home so we're not dependent on other countries in this crisis fourth will provide consistent reliable trusted detailed nationwide guidance and technical support for reopening safely and the resources to make it happen we need a single source of guidance that we can trust where we know the information won't change by for any reason other than the science that guides it not political expediency not public image it won't be easy as to open or close social distances isn't an on or off thing and we're learning more every day about the virus and how it spreads we need to be able to adapt and adjust our behavior to responsibly respond appropriately but schools and businesses can't be responsible make responsible decisions if they don't have the information the science it's not just more detail effective guidance they need it's consultations and technical support so people have a place to turn with their questions it's having a government that's in your corner not a government that's turned its back on you once we get our federal state and local governments working together once there's universal masking enough ppe and testing to go around science back guidance to help us make the right decision then we can get our kids back to school safely our business is growing and our economy running again without wasting another minute as i said last night i'm not going to shut down the economy i'm not going to shut down the country i'm going to shut down the virus and finally we focus on developing safe and effective treatments and distributing a safe and effective vaccine president trump claims he found a cure let me tell you yet we have 1 000 people dying each day more than 40 000 people are in hospitals right now battling the virus life-saving therapies shouldn't be just available to the wealthy they're all connected we need to make sure they're available to everybody available and affordable it's also possible we could learn any day that one of these vaccines currently in trial is showing itself to be effective that will be a wonderful day for our people and people around the world everywhere whether it comes next week or in the next two months but it's still it will still be many months before any vaccine is widely available and we need a president who will take responsibility for making sure it gets to every single person in this country in a way that's equitable and accountable we need a president who in the meantime is doing his job to protect the american people once we have a safe and effective vaccine it has to be free to everyone whether or not you're insured let me say that again the vaccine must be free and freely available to everyone this is just not one more reason why it's so despicable that donald trump is fighting in the middle of a pandemic to get the u.s supreme court to strike down the entire affordable care act which i work so damn hard to get the votes for under the aca insurers are required to cover recommended vaccines for free so overturning the aca would mean people have to pay to get cover 19 vaccine that's wrong very very wrong unlike donald trump i believe health care isn't a privilege i think it's a right that's why as president i'll protect and build on the aca by adding a public option that will compete with private plans to expand coverage and lower health care costs across the board i'll bring down drug prices by allowing medicare to negotiate with pharmaceutical companies i'll make sure americans have insurance those with insurance have access to free covert 19 vaccine and i'll direct the federal government to bulk purchase as many doses as necessary of the cover 19 vaccines so we can provide it free to those who are uninsured underinsured or medicaid eligible throughout all this throughout all this yes mr president i'll listen to the scientists and i'll empower them i know how much president trump has damaged faith in our institutions and our leaders in government itself we have to rebuild the trust between the public and his public servants it's one of the most difficult tasks we'll face in the coming years but if i'm elected president i'll always give it to you as fdr said straight from the shoulder i'll deliver on my promises i'll listen to the american people no matter what their politics i'll let the doctors and the scientists speak freely so you can make the best decision possible for yourself and for your family and i won't let four years of donald trump rob us of those fundamental american qualities our hope in the future and our faith in ourselves we can beat this virus we're not too divided to achieve big things we're america we can do this we've never failed when we work together imagine imagine a true nationally coordinated plan where he spared no expense so our schools have the resources they need to reopen with full health and safety protocols in place imagine every small business getting a restart package that helps cover the cost of installing plexiglas providing ppe and more to minimize the risk of exposure for customers and workers imagine their older americans and people with disabilities having the peace of mind that comes with trusting that the public health system is working for them imagine instead of staying locked up in their rooms they're able to hug their grandchildren or other those who they love and haven't been able to see imagine if you're a member of a community that has been hit particularly hard black latino asian americans or native americans imagine a public health and economic response that treats your needs as a priority not as an afterthought a day in the not too distant future when you can enjoy dinner with your friends and your family and maybe even go out to a movie when you can celebrate your birthday weddings graduations surrounded by your nearest and dearest friends that's the biden harris agenda to beat cover 19. it's going to take all of us working together and that's not hyperbole all of us working together watching out for one another we're all still going to have to wear our mask a practical social distancing a while longer it's going to be hard but if we follow the signs and keep faith with one another with one another i promise you we'll get through this and come out the other side much faster than the rate we're going now look you all know this the american people have always given their best to this country in times of crisis and this time isn't any different i'm not joking when i say this i think every day about the brave doctors and nurses and hospital workers police officers firefighters emts and other first responders who are not figuratively but literally are putting their lives on the line day in and day out to care for people i think the essential workers who carry the rest of us on their shoulders through these many months the grocery store clerks the delivery clerks the drivers the best to their country when we need them the most think of the small businesses who moved heaven and earth to try to take care of their employees and keep their businesses open and sadly of all those who couldn't because they didn't get the help they were promised i think of the parents juggling working from home with the added demands of overseeing the child's educations i think about the educators or spending hours learning how to teach online they're doing what they always do giving above and beyond for their students i think of the families in the communities who have stepped up donating to charities doing grocery runs for older relatives and neighbors finding new ways to connect and support one another that's the america we know that's the united states of america that's who we are and like john kent john f kennedy when he committed to take us to the moon he said i refuse to postpone the possibilities that exist for this country i refuse to postpone refuse to postpone the american purpose that will not only lead our country back but lead the entire world there is no challenge there's no challenge we cannot meet no enemy we're unable to face no threat we can't conquer we stand together united bound by our common resolve determination and values folks together we can harness the unlimited potential of the american people not just to get back where we were before this virus hit us but to get back better i promise you and you know in your heart we can do this we must do this and we will do it together you know we can do it this is the united states of america may god bless you all and may god protect our frontline workers and all those who have lost a loved one thank you and keep the faith,b we see PRON refuse to take responsibility for the crisis that should have be meet with real presidential leadership instead PRON have cost hundred of thousand of americans live and push million into poverty PRON see PRON diminish the pain feel by so many americans president trump say PRON be round the corner PRON be go away PRON be learn to live with PRON there be quote but as i tell PRON last night PRON be not learn to live with PRON PRON be learn to die with PRON this be a dark winter ahead already more than people in the united states of america have lose PRON life to this virus empty chair at dinner table all across this country PRON heart go out to every single person who be have to endure the agony of say goodbye to someone PRON love and adore over a video chat who could not gather PRON close friend even PRON full family to grieve together at a funeral mass or a funeral service and bad yet a new study from columbia university suggest anywhere between and of those death be avoidable lead medical journal in america quite frankly in the world write an unprecedented editorial to the good of PRON knowledge PRON have never write anything like this PRON criticize president trump quote dangerously incompetent end of quote response and state that PRON quote take a crisis and turn PRON into a tragedy culver dwarf anything PRON have face in recent history and PRON be not show any sign of slow down the virus be surge in almost every state PRON pass million case when trump be ask this week what PRON do differently to get the pandemic response right from the start PRON answer be and i quote not much not much as many as two hundred and ten thousand avoidable death but there be not much PRON would do differently the united states be four percent of the entire world population yet PRON make up twenty percent of all the death worldwide if this be a success what be a failure look like PRON be more than eight month into this crisis and the president still do not have a plan PRON be give up PRON be quit on PRON PRON be quit on PRON family PRON be quit on america PRON just want PRON to grow numb and resign to the horror of this death toll and the pain be cause so many americans but PRON can not erase PRON own word or deed in february PRON know just how dangerous this virus be PRON tell bob woodruin in a tape interview this disease be deadly far bad than the flu but instead of tell PRON how bad PRON be go to be accord to the new york times PRON administration only give wall street investor a head up head up and PRON make a bundle do something call call sell short or bet against the market so wall street know PRON be come while the rest of PRON take the full brunt of PRON in june when PRON begin to see the resurgence of covet i call off president trump for waver and wave the white flag of surrender to the virus but then PRON be as if PRON decide to go on offense for the virus hold rally with no mask no social distancing where people contract the virus invite the virus into the white house host what dr fauci call super spreader event endanger more people life by tell the public do not worry do not worry about the disease do not let PRON dominate PRON how many people from christian in arizona will end up suffer because PRON love one listen to the president kristen say PRON dad vote for trump listen to PRON believe PRON that the virus be not a big deal then PRON dad become infected and die christian say PRON be PRON dad only pre existing condition this be PRON quote the only pre existing condition be trust donald trump and the quote even after contract the virus PRON donald trump still still refuse to promote universal mass querying which could have save nearly life and could still save over life in the next few month the long donald trump be present the more reckless PRON get PRON do not have to be hold prisoner by this administration failure PRON can choose a different path PRON can do what americans have always do come together and meet the challenge with grit compassion and determination and today PRON be go to tell PRON exactly what i plan to do if i have the honor of be elect PRON next president PRON will immediately put in place a national strategy that will position PRON country to finally get ahead of this virus and get back PRON life PRON will reach out to every governor in every state red and blue as well as mayor and local official during transition to find out what support PRON need and how much of PRON PRON need PRON will ask the new congress to put a bill on PRON desk by the end of january with all the resource necessary to see how both PRON public health and PRON economic response can be see through the end what be need look a pandemic do not play favor nor will i as i say no red state no blue state just the united states united in PRON response unite in PRON purpose to stop the spread of covet and beat this virus first PRON will go to every governor urge PRON to mandate mass wear in PRON state and if PRON refuse PRON will go to the mayor and county executive and get local mask requirement in place nationwide as president PRON will mandate masquerade in all federal building and all interstate transportation because mass save live period look what happen in arizona republican governor initially try to bar local government from implement mandate on PRON community what happen in june arizona get hit with a surge of case hospital be flood the state health system be overwhelm so city and county appeal the governor ruling PRON impose PRON own local mandate cover most of the state the result case fall by percent wear a mask be not a political statement PRON be a scientific imperative PRON be a point of patriotic pride so PRON can pull PRON country out of this god awful spiral PRON be in and PRON be a testament to the value PRON be teach by PRON family and by PRON faith love thy neighbor as thyself second PRON will put a national testing plan in place with a goal of testing as many people each day as PRON be currently test each week a seven fold increase there be a key difference in this campaign between donald trump and PRON i believe in test donald trump do not i believe in science i believe in public health official i believe in the example of other country which prove that widespread testing be need to regain the health of PRON nation to reopen safely and critically to stay open every school every worker every american should have easy access to regular reliable free testing to achieve this PRON need to increase both lab base diagnostic testing with the result back within hour or less and faster cheap screening test that PRON could take right at home or in school look what PRON have right now be not anywhere near good enough state be still improvise on the fly school district be still mostly on PRON own and many americans still do not know when PRON be important to get a test or how this be not beyond PRON capacity to master not if PRON be direct a coordinated effort across government and the private sector instead of leave chaos terrain PRON will manufacture the lab supply need to make sure PRON have enough test and PRON will tap more of PRON nation lab capacity so PRON can get PRON test result more quickly PRON will build a national core of contact tracer to work closely with trust organization in these community that be most at risk will also take step to ensure that no one have to choose be between get a test and put food on the table look and that no one no one be scare that be test for covet may jeopardize PRON immigration status the only way PRON will defeat this virus be if PRON defeat PRON everywhere the third point PRON would like to make be PRON will close the personal protective equipment the ppe gap and get the gear out where PRON be need every healthcare worker will have a reliable supply of properly fit n mask PRON be unconscionable there be more than eight month into this crisis and frontline healthcare worker be still ration PRON personal protective equipment as president PRON will use the full power of the defense production act to drive the manufacturing of personal protective equipment mask glove gown and more and ensure that PRON be distribute equitably look PRON will not stop until the nation supply exceed the demand and PRON stockpile be replenish especially in hearted area and in community that be disproportionately impact by the virus i will appoint a fully empower i will appoint a fully empower supply commander who be in charge of fill in the gap PRON will make sure PRON can manufacture critical supply right here at home so PRON be not dependent on other country in this crisis fourth will provide consistent reliable trust detail nationwide guidance and technical support for reopen safely and the resource to make PRON happen PRON need a single source of guidance that PRON can trust where PRON know the information will not change by for any reason other than the science that guide PRON not political expediency not public image PRON will not be easy as to open or close social distance be not an on or off thing and PRON be learn more every day about the virus and how PRON spread PRON need to be able to adapt and adjust PRON behavior to responsibly respond appropriately but school and business can not be responsible make responsible decision if PRON do not have the information the science PRON be not just more detail effective guidance PRON need PRON be consultation and technical support so people have a place to turn with PRON question PRON be have a government that be in PRON corner not a government that be turn PRON back on PRON once PRON get PRON federal state and local government work together once there be universal mask enough ppe and testing to go around science back guidance to help PRON make the right decision then PRON can get PRON kid back to school safely PRON business be grow and PRON economy run again without waste another minute as i say last night PRON be not go to shut down the economy PRON be not go to shut down the country PRON be go to shut down the virus and finally PRON focus on develop safe and effective treatment and distribute a safe and effective vaccine president trump claim PRON find a cure let PRON tell PRON yet PRON have people die each day more than people be in hospital right now battle the virus life save therapy should not be just available to the wealthy PRON be all connect PRON need to make sure PRON be available to everybody available and affordable PRON be also possible PRON could learn any day that one of these vaccine currently in trial be show PRON to be effective that will be a wonderful day for PRON people and people around the world everywhere whether PRON come next week or in the next two month but PRON be still PRON will still be many month before any vaccine be widely available and PRON need a president who will take responsibility for make sure PRON get to every single person in this country in a way that be equitable and accountable PRON need a president who in the meantime be do PRON job to protect the american people once PRON have a safe and effective vaccine PRON have to be free to everyone whether or not PRON be insure let PRON say that again the vaccine must be free and freely available to everyone this be just not one more reason why PRON be so despicable that donald trump be fight in the middle of a pandemic to get the u s supreme court to strike down the entire affordable care act which i work so damn hard to get the vote for under the aca insurer be require to cover recommend vaccine for free so overturn the aca would mean people have to pay to get cover vaccine that be wrong very very wrong unlike donald trump i believe health care be not a privilege i think PRON be a right that be why as president PRON will protect and build on the aca by add a public option that will compete with private plan to expand coverage and low health care cost across the board PRON will bring down drug price by allow medicare to negotiate with pharmaceutical company PRON will make sure americans have insurance those with insurance have access to free covert vaccine and PRON will direct the federal government to bulk purchase as many dose as necessary of the cover vaccine so PRON can provide PRON free to those who be uninsured underinsured or medicaid eligible throughout all this throughout all this yes mr president PRON will listen to the scientist and PRON will empower PRON i know how much president trump have damage faith in PRON institution and PRON leader in government PRON PRON have to rebuild the trust between the public and PRON public servant PRON be one of the most difficult task PRON will face in the come year but if PRON be elect president PRON will always give PRON to PRON as fdr say straight from the shoulder PRON will deliver on PRON promise PRON will listen to the american people no matter what PRON politic PRON will let the doctor and the scientist speak freely so PRON can make the good decision possible for PRON and for PRON family and i will not let four year of donald trump rob PRON of those fundamental american quality PRON hope in the future and PRON faith in PRON PRON can beat this virus PRON be not too divide to achieve big thing PRON be america PRON can do this PRON have never fail when PRON work together imagine imagine a true nationally coordinated plan where PRON spare no expense so PRON school have the resource PRON need to reopen with full health and safety protocol in place imagine every small business get a restart package that help cover the cost of instal plexiglas provide ppe and more to minimize the risk of exposure for customer and worker imagine PRON old americans and people with disability have the peace of mind that come with trust that the public health system be work for PRON imagine instead of stay lock up in PRON room PRON be able to hug PRON grandchild or other those who PRON love and have not be able to see imagine if PRON be a member of a community that have be hit particularly hard black latino asian americans or native americans imagine a public health and economic response that treat PRON need as a priority not as an afterthought a day in the not too distant future when PRON can enjoy dinner with PRON friend and PRON family and maybe even go out to a movie when PRON can celebrate PRON birthday wedding graduation surround by PRON near and dear friend that be the biden harris agenda to beat cover PRON be go to take all of PRON work together and that be not hyperbole all of PRON work together watch out for one another PRON be all still go to have to wear PRON mask a practical social distancing a while longer PRON be go to be hard but if PRON follow the sign and keep faith with one another with one another i promise PRON PRON will get through this and come out the other side much faster than the rate PRON be go now look PRON all know this the american people have always give PRON good to this country in time of crisis and this time be not any different PRON be not joke when i say this i think every day about the brave doctor and nurse and hospital worker police officer firefighter emts and other first responder who be not figuratively but literally be put PRON life on the line day in and day out to care for people i think the essential worker who carry the rest of PRON on PRON shoulder through these many month the grocery store clerk the delivery clerk the driver the good to PRON country when PRON need PRON the most think of the small business who move heaven and earth to try to take care of PRON employee and keep PRON business open and sadly of all those who could not because PRON do not get the help PRON be promise i think of the parent juggle work from home with the add demand of oversee the child education i think about the educator or spend hour learn how to teach online PRON be do what PRON always do give above and beyond for PRON student i think of the family in the community who have step up donate to charity do grocery run for old relative and neighbor find new way to connect and support one another that be the america PRON know that be the united states of america that be who PRON be and like john kent john f kennedy when PRON commit to take PRON to the moon PRON say i refuse to postpone the possibility that exist for this country i refuse to postpone refuse to postpone the american purpose that will not only lead PRON country back but lead the entire world there be no challenge there be no challenge PRON can not meet no enemy PRON be unable to face no threat PRON can not conquer PRON stand together united bind by PRON common resolve determination and value folk together PRON can harness the unlimited potential of the american people not just to get back where PRON be before this virus hit PRON but to get back better i promise PRON and PRON know in PRON heart PRON can do this PRON must do this and PRON will do PRON together PRON know PRON can do PRON this be the united states of america may god bless PRON all and may god protect PRON frontline worker and all those who have lose a loved one thank PRON and keep the faith
154,8fjmmw7TNPY,biden,2020-10-26T07:19:29Z,Talk Time 🔴 Watch Joe Biden’s Full Interview With Craig Melvin   TODAY,interview,let's just start with the endorsement i mean you just picked up uh the endorsement of the highest-ranking african-american in congress three days before uh the the primary here what do you hope uh to accomplish with that what message do you hope that sends well i hope it sends the message that jim clyburn tried to send which was that i've always been with the community i've been a strong supporter i've been consistent i've worked with south carolina for a long long time during the great recession we were able to pour in a half a billion dollars in here in just a charleston area creating 111 jobs in this state come from the port we've invested a lot in that and so i've been deeply involved with the community here just because of fritz hollings and my work here over the years and to have jim clyburn give such a full-throated endorsement there's 240 electeds in this state and leaders in the state have endorsed me 95 of whom african-americans but i think and you know this state as well as anyone i think he may be the most respected person in the state and as jim said south carolina has launch presidencies and i'm i'm looking forward to the launch uh tuesday night the 10th debate you you seemed keen on on mixing it up a bit more uh last night a lot of folks have said it's been your best debate performance so far what took so long well you know i've been reluctant to criticize other people in other words my record is fair game and while i was viewed as the front runner this whole time everybody went after me and but then i found out like for example when bernie started talking about how everybody's embracing barack now like he's their best buddy well bernie in 2012 said there was a great disappointment thought he should be primary you know people don't know that but he campaigned for barack obama well he said he wanted a primary barack obama in the middle as we're about to approach and not one incumbent president who's had a serious primary has ever gone on to win and so come on this is this this wasn't an idle throwaway line i campaigned for he said he's been a great disappointment he's been weak and somebody should primary him um and uh and then you know i find that uh you know he talks about his uh you know criticizes other people on their records uh um the fact that uh you know he his his record on dealing with assault weapons his record on dealing with the brady bill he voted five times against it in the waiting periods he voted to give the only major industry and exemption from being able to be sued the gun industry the gun manufacturers and so it was about uh you know everybody everybody who finally gets to be looked at now they're beginning to look at uh at bernie and uh he's a good guy but we have real disagreements on a number of issues you just mentioned guns a few a few minutes ago michael bloomberg tweeted that the legacy of bernie sanders pro-gun agenda created the conditions for the mother manual shooting we are sitting just a short walk away from from mother emanuel do you think that's too far do you think that's accurate now look uh if we had what i had proposed a five-day waiting period after you apply for a gun you have to wait five you know you can't get it the unless you pass the background check and if after five days you don't pass they don't get back to you with information you could purchase the gun i don't think you should be able to do it at all until you pass the background check but bernie insisted that that was too long a waiting period and he voted to get it down to a single day and if it and now jim clyburn's moved what they call that the charleston loophole right that that white supremacist would not have been able to have that gun but not be able to purchase it if in fact there had been a five-day waiting period i'm not saying bernie is responsible for the deaths but that charleston loophole does in fact allowed him to get the gun within the time frame he got it you said something last night and you just mentioned your uh your former boss barack obama and you said on the debate stage that you had a conversation with them recently and i know you don't talk about your your private conversations with the president but but why hasn't he at least sent up a smoke signal to let folks know that joe biden is his guy in this fight well look um number one i asked him early on not to endorse you regret that no because i think look from the very beginning as you know i've been viewed he's vice president he thinks this is his he thinks he's entitled he thinks he's the guy who thinks it's automatically his that's been the sort of the hit on me from the beginning if he had endorsed me it would have been a double hit biden feels entitled i have to earn this myself what i did i called barack because i wanted to make sure that i did not i didn't want to speak for him about the his comments but bernie made that he that barack obama said the same thing about the cuban leadership he didn't it was a totally different context and i wanted to make sure i never speak for the president i never say what he said but i want that's the context in which i called him and he made it absolutely clear that he has never embraced anyone any dictators in terms of he's acknowledged that some things they've done but then he's gone on to condemn their their activities their practices and they were dictators and that was the point i was trying to clear up because bernie was trying to say well all i did was what barack did well it's not what barack did did he also give you any any campaign pointers during the call we always talk i always listen to them we give each other tips you've uh you've also said on the trail a number of times i've heard you say this that this is a battle for the soul of this nation it really is it is also starting to seem as if this is perhaps a battle for the soul of your party i think that's true if if you were not the nominee what does that then say about the democratic party it says to me that we have uh moved away from our roots our basic rationale for being the existence of the party woodrow wilson once said a party is worth no more than that for which it stands we have always stood for a multi-ethnic multi-racial multi-dimensional party and we have always my basis of support has always been uh working class folks who are white and black and the black community and high school educated people who just deserve a shot i really do believe and you know i i shouldn't say that i've said it many times and that is that you know ordinary people can do extraordinary things if they're given a chance and they shouldn't be limited by their zip code their background their race their religion and and i think that what's at stake here is this notion that somehow um like for example a revolution people are looking for results they're looking to get things done they're looking to build on what barack and i did in our administration they're looking for health care that in fact is affordable available and can get passed and get done now they're looking for access to education early education we now have all kinds of data we didn't have 15 years ago about if you start a child in school when they're three years old instead of waiting to kindergarten they increase exponentially their prospects are succeeding you've we've learned that there's a lot of things that we can do that in fact impact on for example hbcus hbcus have been the basis of the ability of african americans to get off the ground to begin with and and and they're underfunded significantly they don't have endowments that's why i want to spend this i want to spend all this money 70 billion dollars over the next 10 years on endowing them with the capacity to compete for the kind of contracts that build their infrastructure their their intellectual infrastructure whether it's specialties in cyberspace or metallurgy or whatever they don't have that kind of of of endowment to be able to compete for those things why do you think that bernie sanders has been able to convince so many people especially so many young people that he's their guy well bernie has done a very good job of working this for the last five or six years and you know and it's really appealing when you're in a situation where you're struggling to pay for your college tuition when you're having difficulty in dealing with acts being able to get health care etc that i just to promise you everything but i think people are starting to now that's why last night he finally began once again to acknowledge what his health care plan was going to cost he sold half of it he said the employer is going to pay seven half percent more but guess what you're going to pay seven and a half percent more too it's going to you're going to double what you pay and withholding tax for social security and that only gets you a quarter of the way there you know i mean so i think now that people are going to start to look at that he has now risen to the place where his polling numbers are better they're going to now go look look at that like you did with me every major vote i cast for 40 years has been looked at i mean not not figuratively literally it's legitimate and so i think that as people begin to look at what's going on they're going to have a slightly different view and look the idea that um there's going to be this revolution americans aren't looking for evolution they're looking for progress they're looking for tell me how you're going to help me with my health care tell you to make me safer tell you how this vice president some scene keen on a revolution well some do but look at the numbers we always talk about this great increase in participation he's nowhere near he's not going to come anywhere near generating the kind of participation of young folks that barack did in 2008 there's no evidence of that yet now i hope they do participate because the most informed generation in american history and they're now getting involved if they voted in the same percentage as people voted as the average person voted in 2016 would have had 5.2 million more votes but it is it is not at the exclusion of everything else there's a lot of young people out there who are supportive of a a more i won't say rational a more practical path to get things done bernie sanders won nevada won new hampshire came in a close second in iowa he's expected to finish second or third here in south carolina if he does how can you then continue to make the claim that he's not electable because i talk to all the people who are in those states that we have to win find me someone running for the senate north carolina wants them to campaign for him find somebody in texas wants him to campaign for him find me somebody in georgia who wants to campaign wants him to campaign for them bernie is listed uh bernie's not a democrat i mean he's run as a democrat and i i reckon but even when you list last night when they listed the people on you know what the registration is this is independent so i mean this is uh the the idea that somehow we have moved away from the traditional base of the democratic party i think is one of the reasons why we lost and i do hope more young people vote i think you're going to all be surprised at how they vote there's a lot of people who are fervently fervently fervently for bernie at you know at about any cost kind of thing you know this is the only person and i compliment him on the fact that he's kept that going since the last election and you know like for example bernie talks about the fact that you know or his people talk about the fact that whoever goes into the convention with the most delegates should be the nominee was that the case when hillary went in i mean it's like all these epiphanies are occurring here you know what i mean why do you think consistently why do you think he's talking about changing the goalposts because that's the only way he's likely to make it look i mean what do you think should happen i think should happen you play by the rules you go in there and you have to get over 1900 vote i mean you know that's what you have to do that's the deal and the idea that all of a sudden there's a moral dilemma here if that doesn't happen well where was his morality the moral dilemma when they didn't do that for hillary come on i mean this is look i just happen to think that you know uh uh consistency uh on matters that have basic fundamental principles behind them are important it's a little bit like you know bernie talking about guns you know bernie you know is gonna make the make the nation safer well you know bernie's the only guy up there who voted to give gun manufacturers a loophole they couldn't be sued i think it was 2004. it wasn't like it like all of a sudden last night he said he regretted some of his votes on guns well yeah he did what was he done since then he's out there going after every industry have you heard him talk about going up the gun manufacturers he pointed out that when he ran for mayor he lost because he supported the assault weapons ban and then he went and ran for the united states congress well he didn't he wasn't talking about assault weapons ban then the guy ran against supported assault women's ban come on look i think that if you're gonna i think you have to be legit in what you're saying if i said to you that you know i really really care about i've always been deeply involved in the african-american community i come out of the civil rights movement but by the way i invested 90 million dollars in a prison system that i knew hog-tied juveniles here in south carolina hog tied them and held them in a private prison that same prison that same outfit did the same thing tonight in healthcare and and and adequate health for uh folks in in the state of georgia and i knew it and i bought i bought invest in that company when i knew it does that is that consistent with who i say i am i think consistency matters what do you stand for and it can't be bouncing around based upon what's going to get you elected some third look i tell everybody who's ever come to me as a young candidate say what's the most important thing to know know what's worth losing over what are you willing to lose over what are you willing to lose i'm willing to lose over race i'm going to lose over health care i'm going to lose over the idea that we're going to we have to deal with global warming i don't want the job i don't want the job i mean it i don't want the job of i have to go in there and say i'm changing my position on race i'm changing my position on guns i'm changing my position sure everybody makes mistakes in votes but if you make a mistake and you said you were it was a mistake what did you do to fix it what have you done to change it other than say i made a mistake you know jim clyburn again who you know well says you want to know he always quotes fritz hollins you know if you want to know what a man will do go back and look at what he did last night you you also said you surprised some folks by saying if elected you would appoint a black woman to the supreme court and i wanted to ask you what about your your number two spot what about vice president have you already started to have conversations with folks i haven't started having a conversation with my folks about people that be look every time i get in this territory and i talk about it biden's being awfully presumptuous she's talking about who the vice presidential candidate is and but i think two three things one you have to start to decide the people you choose from because you got to do background checks on everybody you got to go and do some thorough background checks i've begun to think about that in terms of both women women of color latinos and and and you know men of color but also on uh others who in fact uh share uh my philosophic view of what to do the one thing i've learned about the only thing i can come in and i know a lot about is the vice presidency and one of the reasons when uh i asked barack why he wanted to vet me he said because we're there's not a single important issue we disagreed on we disagreed on on tactics sometimes and that's what we'd argue about privately sometimes he agreed with me about 30 of the time he changed the tactic most of he's the president but it has to be someone who i'm able to turn to if i'm president and give presidential responsibility to and by that i mean you can do that with cabinet to an extent but when i went abroad or when i spoke and the things the president gave me authority everybody knew i was speaking as if i were the president i had the authority to do the job and the job is so big there's so much that lands on your plate that you have to have someone who you know will not just have your back that's an important thing but will in fact represent the same philosophic view that you have on an issue and you don't have to constantly check would kamala harris fit that bill i think so but again you know i've not spoken to colonel harris about that and it's presumptuous for me to do that but i think kamal harris would be someone look there's a number of of women um who else well i'm not gonna if i start that then i'm in real trouble okay um but i promise you uh uh with uh my close close associates we're beginning to talk about it as a matter of fact uh with um when i talked about the court look i i presided over the hearings either as them as the chairman of the ranking member for ruth bader ginsburg which was a great honor i think she's first rate with elena kagan used to work for the committee um and for sotomayor matter of fact when i had a choice to ask who would privately swear me in because we had that glitch remember i asked that she swear me and so i do think the court the congress the cabinet the white house should look like the country i mean i really think it matters i think it matters and so my expectation would be there will be uh significant representation across the board and everything i do as with my campaign i mean it's uh it's really important i think we are perhaps on the brink of a public health crisis in this country thousands have already died in china from from the coronavirus um white house uh considering appointing a czar to deal with it what do you what do you make of the administration's response so far to the coronavirus it had no response of any consequence matter of fact all the things barack and i put in place brock put in place the president put in place but i was part of my my executive assistant was the guy who handled the ebola issue we've been through this before and we set up a special office in the white house he got rid of the office the president this president trump we in fact increased the funding for the cdc we increased the funding for nih to find vaccines to find ways in which to deal with this we increase money for hospitals to be able to get the nurses in particular hospitals and docs who in fact could deal with this in that case it was ebola now and and we went abroad and stopped it abroad to keep it from coming here what we should do is reinstate all of those things right president today and the most important thing is have a relationship or you go to china like we did in africa say look we want to come in and take a look at what you have we know a lot about this we've done it before this is a place where experience matters i've done it we've been there we dealt with ebola this guy this president of the united states trump is going about it all wrong everything we put in place to guard against this kind of thing because disease knows no border pandemics no no border you have to have a plan he's dismantled he's cut cdc he's tried to cut the nih funding we should be working like the devil on vaccines now now now now we should have been doing it we should be working on making sure that china levels with us and we're inside seeing what's going on for their sake as well as ours thank you thank you that was great you,b let just start with the endorsement i mean PRON just pick up uh the endorsement of the highest rank african american in congress three day before uh the the primary here what do PRON hope uh to accomplish with that what message do PRON hope that send well i hope PRON send the message that jim clyburn try to send which be that PRON have always be with the community PRON have be a strong supporter PRON have be consistent PRON have work with south carolina for a long long time during the great recession PRON be able to pour in a half a billion dollar in here in just a charleston area create job in this state come from the port PRON have invest a lot in that and so PRON have be deeply involve with the community here just because of fritz holling and PRON work here over the year and to have jim clyburn give such a full throated endorsement there be elected in this state and leader in the state have endorse PRON of whom african americans but i think and PRON know this state as well as anyone i think PRON may be the most respected person in the state and as jim say south carolina have launch presidency and PRON be PRON be look forward to the launch uh tuesday night the th debate PRON PRON seem keen on on mix PRON up a bit more uh last night a lot of folk have say PRON be be PRON good debate performance so far what take so long well PRON know PRON have be reluctant to criticize other people in other word PRON record be fair game and while i be view as the front runner this whole time everybody go after PRON and but then i find out like for example when bernie start talk about how everybody be embrace barack now like PRON be PRON good buddy well bernie in say there be a great disappointment think PRON should be primary PRON know people do not know that but PRON campaign for barack obama well PRON say PRON want a primary barack obama in the middle as PRON be about to approach and not one incumbent president who be have a serious primary have ever go on to win and so come on this be this this be not an idle throwaway line i campaign for PRON say PRON be be a great disappointment PRON be be weak and somebody should primary PRON um and uh and then PRON know i find that uh PRON know PRON talk about PRON uh PRON know criticize other people on PRON record uh um the fact that uh PRON know PRON PRON PRON record on deal with assault weapon PRON record on deal with the brady bill PRON vote five time against PRON in the waiting period PRON vote to give the only major industry and exemption from be able to be sue the gun industry the gun manufacturer and so PRON be about uh PRON know everybody everybody who finally get to be look at now PRON be begin to look at uh at bernie and uh PRON be a good guy but PRON have real disagreement on a number of issue PRON just mention gun a few a few minute ago michael bloomberg tweet that the legacy of bernie sander pro gun agenda create the condition for the mother manual shooting PRON be sit just a short walk away from from mother emanuel do PRON think that be too far do PRON think that be accurate now look uh if PRON have what i have propose a five day waiting period after PRON apply for a gun PRON have to wait five PRON know PRON can not get PRON the unless PRON pass the background check and if after five day PRON do not pass PRON do not get back to PRON with information PRON could purchase the gun i do not think PRON should be able to do PRON at all until PRON pass the background check but bernie insist that that be too long a wait period and PRON vote to get PRON down to a single day and if PRON and now jim clyburn move what PRON call that the charleston loophole right that that white supremacist would not have be able to have that gun but not be able to purchase PRON if in fact there have be a five day waiting period PRON be not say bernie be responsible for the death but that charleston loophole do in fact allow PRON to get the gun within the time frame PRON get PRON PRON say something last night and PRON just mention PRON uh PRON former boss barack obama and PRON say on the debate stage that PRON have a conversation with PRON recently and i know PRON do not talk about PRON PRON private conversation with the president but but why have not PRON at least send up a smoke signal to let folk know that joe biden be PRON guy in this fight well look um number one i ask PRON early on not to endorse PRON regret that no because i think look from the very beginning as PRON know PRON have be view PRON be vice president PRON think this be PRON PRON think PRON be entitle PRON think PRON be the guy who think PRON be automatically PRON that be be the sort of the hit on PRON from the beginning if PRON have endorse PRON PRON would have be a double hit biden feel entitle i have to earn this PRON what i do i call barack because i want to make sure that i do not i do not want to speak for PRON about the PRON comment but bernie make that PRON that barack obama say the same thing about the cuban leadership PRON do not PRON be a totally different context and i want to make sure i never speak for the president i never say what PRON say but i want that be the context in which i call PRON and PRON make PRON absolutely clear that PRON have never embrace anyone any dictator in term of PRON be acknowledge that some thing PRON have do but then PRON be go on to condemn PRON PRON activity PRON practice and PRON be dictator and that be the point i be try to clear up because bernie be try to say well all i do be what barack do well PRON be not what barack do do PRON also give PRON any any campaign pointer during the call PRON always talk i always listen to PRON PRON give each other tip PRON have uh PRON have also say on the trail a number of time PRON have hear PRON say this that this be a battle for the soul of this nation PRON really be PRON be also start to seem as if this be perhaps a battle for the soul of PRON party i think that be true if if PRON be not the nominee what do that then say about the democratic party PRON say to PRON that PRON have uh move away from PRON root PRON basic rationale for be the existence of the party woodrow wilson once say a party be worth no more than that for which PRON stand PRON have always stand for a multi ethnic multi racial multi dimensional party and PRON have always PRON basis of support have always be uh work class folk who be white and black and the black community and high school educate people who just deserve a shot i really do believe and PRON know i i should not say that PRON have say PRON many time and that be that PRON know ordinary people can do extraordinary thing if PRON be give a chance and PRON should not be limit by PRON zip code PRON background PRON race PRON religion and and i think that what be at stake here be this notion that somehow um like for example a revolution people be look for result PRON be look to get thing do PRON be look to build on what barack and i do in PRON administration PRON be look for health care that in fact be affordable available and can get pass and get do now PRON be look for access to education early education PRON now have all kind of datum PRON do not have year ago about if PRON start a child in school when PRON be three year old instead of wait to kindergarten PRON increase exponentially PRON prospect be succeed PRON have PRON have learn that there be a lot of thing that PRON can do that in fact impact on for example hbcus hbcus have be the basis of the ability of african americans to get off the ground to begin with and and and PRON be underfunde significantly PRON do not have endowment that be why i want to spend this i want to spend all this money billion dollar over the next year on endow PRON with the capacity to compete for the kind of contract that build PRON infrastructure PRON PRON intellectual infrastructure whether PRON be specialty in cyberspace or metallurgy or whatever PRON do not have that kind of of of endowment to be able to compete for those thing why do PRON think that bernie sander have be able to convince so many people especially so many young people that PRON be PRON guy well bernie have do a very good job of work this for the last five or six year and PRON know and PRON be really appealing when PRON be in a situation where PRON be struggle to pay for PRON college tuition when PRON be have difficulty in deal with act be able to get health care etc that i just to promise PRON everything but i think people be start to now that be why last night PRON finally begin once again to acknowledge what PRON health care plan be go to cost PRON sell half of PRON PRON say the employer be go to pay seven half percent more but guess what PRON be go to pay seven and a half percent more too PRON be go to PRON be go to double what PRON pay and withhold tax for social security and that only get PRON a quarter of the way there PRON know i mean so i think now that people be go to start to look at that PRON have now rise to the place where PRON polling number be well PRON be go to now go look look at that like PRON do with PRON every major vote i cast for year have be look at i mean not not figuratively literally PRON be legitimate and so i think that as people begin to look at what be go on PRON be go to have a slightly different view and look the idea that um there be go to be this revolution americans be not look for evolution PRON be look for progress PRON be look for tell PRON how PRON be go to help PRON with PRON health care tell PRON to make PRON safe tell PRON how this vice president some scene keen on a revolution well some do but look at the number PRON always talk about this great increase in participation PRON be nowhere near PRON be not go to come anywhere near generate the kind of participation of young folk that barack do in there be no evidence of that yet now i hope PRON do participate because the most informed generation in american history and PRON be now get involve if PRON vote in the same percentage as people vote as the average person vote in would have have million more vote but PRON be PRON be not at the exclusion of everything else there be a lot of young people out there who be supportive of a a more i will not say rational a more practical path to get thing do bernie sander win nevada win new hampshire come in a close second in iowa PRON be expect to finish second or third here in south carolina if PRON do how can PRON then continue to make the claim that PRON be not electable because i talk to all the people who be in those state that PRON have to win find PRON someone run for the senate north carolina want PRON to campaign for PRON find somebody in texas want PRON to campaign for PRON find PRON somebody in georgia who want to campaign want PRON to campaign for PRON bernie be list uh bernie be not a democrat i mean PRON be run as a democrat and i i reckon but even when PRON list last night when PRON list the people on PRON know what the registration be this be independent so i mean this be uh the the idea that somehow PRON have move away from the traditional base of the democratic party i think be one of the reason why PRON lose and i do hope more young people vote i think PRON be go to all be surprised at how PRON vote there be a lot of people who be fervently fervently fervently for bernie at PRON know at about any cost kind of thing PRON know this be the only person and i compliment PRON on the fact that PRON be keep that go since the last election and PRON know like for example bernie talk about the fact that PRON know or PRON people talk about the fact that whoever go into the convention with the most delegate should be the nominee be that the case when hillary go in i mean PRON be like all these epiphany be occur here PRON know what i mean why do PRON think consistently why do PRON think PRON be talk about change the goalpost because that be the only way PRON be likely to make PRON look i mean what do PRON think should happen i think should happen PRON play by the rule PRON go in there and PRON have to get over vote i mean PRON know that be what PRON have to do that be the deal and the idea that all of a sudden there be a moral dilemma here if that do not happen well where be PRON morality the moral dilemma when PRON do not do that for hillary come on i mean this be look i just happen to think that PRON know uh uh consistency uh on matter that have basic fundamental principle behind PRON be important PRON be a little bit like PRON know bernie talk about gun PRON know bernie PRON know be go to make the make the nation safe well PRON know bernie be the only guy up there who vote to give gun manufacturer a loophole PRON could not be sue i think PRON be PRON be not like PRON like all of a sudden last night PRON say PRON regret some of PRON vote on gun well yeah PRON do what be PRON do since then PRON be out there go after every industry have PRON hear PRON talk about go up the gun manufacturer PRON point out that when PRON run for mayor PRON lose because PRON support the assault weapon ban and then PRON go and run for the united states congress well PRON do not PRON be not talk about assault weapon ban then the guy run against supported assault woman ban come on look i think that if PRON be go to i think PRON have to be legit in what PRON be say if i say to PRON that PRON know i really really care about PRON have always be deeply involved in the african american community i come out of the civil right movement but by the way i invest million dollar in a prison system that i know hog tie juvenile here in south carolina hog tie PRON and hold PRON in a private prison that same prison that same outfit do the same thing tonight in healthcare and and and adequate health for uh folk in in the state of georgia and i know PRON and i buy i buy invest in that company when i know PRON do that be that consistent with who i say i be i think consistency matter what do PRON stand for and PRON can not be bounce around base upon what be go to get PRON elect some third look i tell everybody who be ever come to PRON as a young candidate say what be the most important thing to know know what be worth lose over what be PRON willing to lose over what be PRON willing to lose PRON be willing to lose over race PRON be go to lose over health care PRON be go to lose over the idea that PRON be go to PRON have to deal with global warming i do not want the job i do not want the job i mean PRON i do not want the job of i have to go in there and say PRON be change PRON position on race PRON be change PRON position on gun PRON be change PRON position sure everybody make mistake in vote but if PRON make a mistake and PRON say PRON be PRON be a mistake what do PRON do to fix PRON what have PRON do to change PRON other than say i make a mistake PRON know jim clyburn again who PRON know well say PRON want to know PRON always quote fritz hollin PRON know if PRON want to know what a man will do go back and look at what PRON do last night PRON PRON also say PRON surprise some folk by say if elect PRON would appoint a black woman to the supreme court and i want to ask PRON what about PRON PRON number two spot what about vice president have PRON already start to have conversation with folk i have not start have a conversation with PRON folk about people that be look every time i get in this territory and i talk about PRON biden be awfully presumptuous PRON be talk about who the vice presidential candidate be and but i think two three thing one PRON have to start to decide the people PRON choose from because PRON get to do background check on everybody PRON get to go and do some thorough background check PRON have begin to think about that in term of both woman woman of color latino and and and PRON know man of color but also on uh other who in fact uh share uh PRON philosophic view of what to do the one thing PRON have learn about the only thing i can come in and i know a lot about be the vice presidency and one of the reason when uh i ask barack why PRON want to vet PRON PRON say because PRON be there be not a single important issue PRON disagree on PRON disagree on on tactic sometimes and that be what PRON would argue about privately sometimes PRON agree with PRON about of the time PRON change the tactic most of PRON be the president but PRON have to be someone who PRON be able to turn to if PRON be president and give presidential responsibility to and by that i mean PRON can do that with cabinet to an extent but when i go abroad or when i speak and the thing the president give PRON authority everybody know i be speak as if i be the president i have the authority to do the job and the job be so big there be so much that land on PRON plate that PRON have to have someone who PRON know will not just have PRON back that be an important thing but will in fact represent the same philosophic view that PRON have on an issue and PRON do not have to constantly check would kamala harris fit that bill i think so but again PRON know PRON have not speak to colonel harris about that and PRON be presumptuous for PRON to do that but i think kamal harris would be someone look there be a number of of woman um who else well PRON be not go to if i start that then PRON be in real trouble okay um but i promise PRON uh uh with uh PRON close close associate PRON be begin to talk about PRON as a matter of fact uh with um when i talk about the court look i i preside over the hearing either as PRON as the chairman of the rank member for ruth bader ginsburg which be a great honor i think PRON be first rate with elena kagan use to work for the committee um and for sotomayor matter of fact when i have a choice to ask who would privately swear PRON in because PRON have that glitch remember i ask that PRON swear PRON and so i do think the court the congress the cabinet the white house should look like the country i mean i really think PRON matter i think PRON matter and so PRON expectation would be there will be uh significant representation across the board and everything i do as with PRON campaign i mean PRON be uh PRON be really important i think PRON be perhaps on the brink of a public health crisis in this country thousand have already die in china from from the coronavirus um white house uh consider appoint a czar to deal with PRON what do PRON what do PRON make of the administration response so far to the coronavirus PRON have no response of any consequence matter of fact all the thing barack and i put in place brock put in place the president put in place but i be part of PRON PRON executive assistant be the guy who handle the ebola issue PRON have be through this before and PRON set up a special office in the white house PRON get rid of the office the president this president trump PRON in fact increase the funding for the cdc PRON increase the funding for nih to find vaccine to find way in which to deal with this PRON increase money for hospital to be able to get the nurse in particular hospital and doc who in fact could deal with this in that case PRON be ebola now and and PRON go abroad and stop PRON abroad to keep PRON from come here what PRON should do be reinstate all of those thing right president today and the most important thing be have a relationship or PRON go to china like PRON do in africa say look PRON want to come in and take a look at what PRON have PRON know a lot about this PRON have do PRON before this be a place where experience matter PRON have do PRON PRON have be there PRON deal with ebola this guy this president of the united states trump be go about PRON all wrong everything PRON put in place to guard against this kind of thing because disease know no border pandemic no no border PRON have to have a plan PRON be dismantle PRON be cut cdc PRON be try to cut the nih funding PRON should be work like the devil on vaccine now now now now PRON should have be do PRON PRON should be work on make sure that china level with PRON and PRON be inside see what be go on for PRON sake as well as our thank PRON thank PRON that be great PRON
158,M0MWfj4ldfw,biden,2020-10-30T13:59:51Z,"Full Episode: “Former Vice President Joe Biden (Season 8, Ep. 809)"" | SuperSoul Sunday | OWN",speech,"Oprah: TODAY ON ""SUPERSOUL SUNDAY,"" FORMER VICE PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN. YOU HAVE NO REGRET IN THE DEEPEST, QUIETEST, PUREST MOMENTS ABOUT NOT ACTUALLY RUNNING? HE'S SPEAKING FOR THE FIRST TIME ON TELEVISION ABOUT HIS HIGHLY-ANTICIPATED AND DEEPLY PERSONAL NEW BOOK, ""PROMISE ME, DAD: A YEAR OF HOPE, HARDSHIP, AND PURPOSE."" WHAT DID HAVING TO REVISIT ALL OF THE MAJOR MOMENTS IN YOUR LIFE TEACH YOU ABOUT WHERE YOU ARE NOW? REGARDED AS ONE OF THE MOST INFLUENTIAL VICE PRESIDENTS IN HISTORY, JOE BIDEN REFLECTS ON THIS TUMULTUOUS PERIOD OF AMERICAN POLITICS. A MONTH OUT, I CAME BACK AND SAID, ""WE'RE GOING TO LOSE THIS ELECTION."" HE SHARES HIS FAMILY'S SPIRITUAL AND EMOTIONAL JOURNEY AFTER THE HEARTBREAKING DEATH OF HIS SON, BEAU... WHAT HAPPENS IN THAT MOMENT WHEN YOU CAN LITERALLY SEE THE SPIRIT GOES SOMEPLACE? ...HIS RESILIENCE IN THE FACE OF PUBLIC SCRUTINY... WE WERE TAUGHT TO JUST TO GET UP. WHEN YOU GET KNOCKED DOWN, JUST GET UP. ...AND WHY THE DECISION NOT TO RUN FOR PRESIDENT STILL WEIGHS ON HIM. WAS I PREPARED TO BE ABLE TO GIVE MY WHOLE HEART, MY WHOLE SOUL, AND ALL MY ATTENTION TO THE ENDEAVOR? AND I KNEW I WASN'T. DO YOU FEEL THAT YOU COULD'VE BEATEN HILLARY? SO THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE, MR. VICE PRESIDENT. I'M HAPPY TO BE HERE. I KNOW COMING ALL THE WAY TO CALIFORNIA WAS... OH, I'M DELIGHTED TO BE HERE. IT'S ALWAYS A PLEASURE TO BE HERE. I WANTED TO START WITH THE MOMENT THAT WE ALL GOT TO SEE YOU EXPERIENCE ON CBS WHEN YOU DID THE LETTER TO YOURSELF. I FOUND THAT SO MOVING. LAST YEAR, YOU WROTE A LETTER TO YOUR YOUNGER SELF THAT STARTS WITH, ""DEAR JOE, YOUR STUTTER IS DEBILITATING. IT EMBARRASSES YOU, AND THE BULLIES ARE VICIOUS, BUT LISTEN TO MOM WHEN SHE SAYS BRAVERY RESIDES IN EVERY HEART, AND YOURS IS FIERCE AND CLEAR."" SHE DID SAY THAT. AHH. I JUST THOUGHT THAT'S NOT AN EASY FIRST SENTENCE, AND THE REST OF THE LETTER, AS IS YOUR NEW BOOK, JUST AS PERSONAL. SO WHAT DID COMING TO TERMS WITH WRITING THIS BOOK AND HAVING TO REVISIT ALL OF THE MAJOR MOMENTS IN YOUR LIFE TEACH YOU ABOUT WHERE YOU ARE NOW? WELL, YOU KNOW... MY MOTHER USED TO SAY, AND I THOUGHT IT WAS SO CRUEL AT ONE POINT, ESPECIALLY WHEN I LOST MY WIFE AND DAUGHTER, AND WE WALKED OUT OF THE HOSPITAL LATE. A TRACTOR TRAILER HAD BROADSIDED AND KILLED THEM, AND MY TWO SONS WERE BADLY INJURED, AND SHE SAID, ""JOEY,"" GRABBED MY HAND AND SHE SAID, ""OUT OF EVERYTHING HORRIBLE, SOMETHING GOOD WILL COME IF YOU LOOK HARD ENOUGH FOR IT,"" BUT THAT WAS MY MOTHER'S NOTION. WE WERE TAUGHT TO JUST TO GET UP. WHEN YOU GET KNOCKED DOWN, JUST GET UP AND MOVE FORWARD AND TALK ABOUT HOW SO MANY PEOPLE WITHOUT THE KIND OF HELP THAT I HAD DO IT EVERY DAY, RIGHT? RIGHT TODAY, THERE IS SOMEBODY WHO HAS GONE THROUGH SOMETHING THAT WAS SIGNIFICANTLY WORSE THAN ME, AND THEY HAVE NOBODY BEHIND THEM, AND THEY'RE GETTING UP, AND THEY'RE MOVING, AND IT GIVES ME SUCH OVERWHELMING CONFIDENCE IN PEOPLE, THE ABILITY TO ABSORB PAIN AND THE SPIRITUAL REASSURANCE THAT COMES FROM KNOWING THEY'RE STILL A PART OF YOU. WOULD YOU SAY THAT THAT IS ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT SPIRITUAL CHARACTERISTICS TO HAVE, THAT IS TO KEEP GETTING UP? ABSOLUTELY, ABSOLUTELY, BECAUSE YOU KNOW, IT'S -- I'M NOT SAYING IT'S EASY. I HAVE TO ADMIT TO YOU THERE HAVE BEEN A COUPLE TIMES IN MY -- WELL, ONE IN PARTICULAR IN MY LIFE WHERE I HAVE ACTUALLY LOST MY FAITH WHERE I WENT THROUGH A PERIOD OF THINKING, ""HOW COULD THIS BE?"" I MEAN, WHY, YOU KNOW, LIKE, THE ""WHY ME?"" PIECE. MM-HMM. MY DAD, WHO WAS A WONDERFUL, WELL-READ, GRACEFUL HIGH-SCHOOL-EDUCATED GUY, SAID, ""CHAMP, WHERE WAS IT WRITTEN THAT LIFE OWES YOU A LIVING, MAN?"" I KNOW, BUT IT DOESN'T MAKE YOU FEEL ANY BETTER IN THE MOMENT. WELL, WHAT IT MAKES... IT MAKES YOU, AT LEAST IN MY FAMILY... MY MOTHER THOUGHT THE GREATEST VIRTUE OF ALL WAS COURAGE AND BECAUSE IT ALLOWED ALL THE OTHER VIRTUES TO EXIST, AND FROM THE TIME I WAS A KID, NOT A JOKE, MY MOTHER WOULD GO, ""LOOK AT ME, JOEY."" MM-HMM. ""LOOK AT ME. REMEMBER, YOU'RE DEFINED BY YOUR COURAGE..."" WOW. ""...AND YOU'RE REDEEMED BY YOUR LOYALTY. LOOK AT ME, JOEY."" AND IT WAS THIS NOTION THAT YOU COULD DO ANYTHING BECAUSE THERE IS THIS NOTION IN MY FAITH, MY FAMILY, THAT THOSE YOU LOSE REMAIN A PART OF YOU. MM-HMM. BUT IT'S HARD TO GET THERE. IT'S HARD TO GET TO THE PLACE WHERE A MEMORY BRINGS A SMILE TO YOUR LIP BEFORE IT BRINGS A TEAR TO YOUR EYE. MM-HMM. I MEAN, IT'S A HARD THING TO GO THROUGH, BUT I WAS LUCKY. I ALWAYS HAD -- YOU'VE BEEN THROUGH IT A FEW TIMES. WELL, A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE BEEN THROUGH IT. YEAH. IN 1972, JUST WEEKS AFTER WINNING HIS FIRST RACE FOR SENATOR OF DELAWARE, VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN'S FIRST WIFE, NEILIA, AND HIS 13-MONTH-OLD DAUGHTER, NAOMI, WERE KILLED IN A CAR ACCIDENT. HIS SONS, HUNTER AND BEAU, WERE AGE 3 AND 4 AT THE TIME. THEY WERE INJURED BUT SURVIVED. IN 2015, BEAU BIDEN, A DECORATED WAR VETERAN AND DELAWARE'S ATTORNEY GENERAL, LOST HIS BATTLE WITH BRAIN CANCER. BEAU WAS 46 YEARS OLD. SO WHEN YOU GET THAT CALL, AND YOU'RE LIVING IN THAT SPACE OF DISBELIEF THAT THIS HAS ACTUALLY HAPPENED, AND YOU THINK THAT THIS IS THE WORST POSSIBLE THING THAT COULD EVER HAPPEN TO YOU, BUT YOU HAVE SOMEHOW BEEN TRAINED BY YOUR PARENTS, BY YOUR BELIEF SYSTEM, TO LOOK FOR THE OPPORTUNITY WITHIN EVERY TRAGEDY, BUT THAT DOESN'T COME EASY. NO, NO, IT DOESN'T. LOOK, I MEAN, I STILL... I STILL FIND MYSELF WHEN I TALK ABOUT MY BEAU, MY SON... YEAH. ...WHO DIED. AND I SOMETIMES FIND MYSELF SAY SOMETHING ABOUT IT, AND I CAN'T HANDLE IT. I START TO... I BREAK DOWN, SO IT'S NOT LIKE THE PAIN EVER GOES AWAY, BUT WHAT I DO IS I LOOK AT MY GRANDSON, HIS SON. MM-HMM. I SEE HIM. I LOOK AT MY GRANDDAUGHTER. I SEE HER, AND I KNOW HE'S STILL HERE. I KNOW HE'S STILL WITH ME. BUT WHEN YOU LOST NAOMI, YOUR BABY DAUGHTER, IN THE CAR ACCIDENT WITH YOUR FIRST WIFE -- NO PREPARATION, THE SHOCK OF IT, THE HORROR OF IT, IT'S QUITE DIFFERENT, ISN'T IT, WHEN YOU HAVE HAD SOME PREPARATION KNOWING THAT BEAU WAS SICK FOR A WHILE, OR IS IT? IT'S DIFFERENT, AND IT'S PROBABLY DIFFERENT FOR EVERY PERSON, BUT FOR ME, WHEN WHAT HAPPENED TO MY WIFE AND DAUGHTER HAPPENED, I HAD... I HAD A REASON TO LIVE. I HAD A REASON BY THESE TWO LITTLE BOYS WHO WERE IN THE HOSPITAL, AND, YOU KNOW, I SAID AT THE TIME -- I PROBABLY SHOULD'VE NEVER SAID IT ALL THOSE YEARS AGO. I SAID, ""I CAN UNDERSTAND HOW SOMEONE COULD BE COMPLETELY, THOROUGHLY SANE AND COMMIT SUICIDE AND DECIDE THAT, LOOK, I'VE BEEN TO THE TOP OF THE MOUNTAINS""... MM-HMM. ...""I'M NOT GETTING THERE AGAIN. I HAD IT ALL, AND THERE'S JUST, YOU KNOW""... MM-HMM. ...""SO LONG."" BUT I HAD THOSE TWO BOYS, AND IRONICALLY, THEY ENDED UP RAISING ME, OPRAH, NOT A JOKE. I MEAN, TO THIS DAY, MY SON, HUNTER, WHO IS PART OF MY SOUL, IF WE WALKED OFF OUT OF HERE AND HE SAID, ""HEY DAD, CAN I GET YOU ANYTHING,"" HE'D COME UP AND GIVE ME A KISS. HE'S 45 YEARS OLD, THE SMARTEST GUY I KNOW. HE'D GIVE ME A KISS. ""DAD, YOU NEED ANYTHING? YOU OKAY, DAD?"" CALLING ME, ASKING ME.    THEY LOST THEIR MOTHER. THEY LOST -- SO THERE WAS REINFORCEMENT. WATCHING SOMEONE WHO YOU ADORE, WHO REALLY IS PART OF YOUR SOUL, I MEAN, NOT -- IT'S NOT HYPERBOLE. WATCHING HIM GO THROUGH WITH SUCH GRACE BUT SUCH AWFUL PAIN, DYING, KNOWING THAT THE LIKELIHOOD THAT HE WAS GOING TO BE ABLE TO SURVIVE WAS VIRTUALLY NONEXISTENT. SO WE GOT THE DIAGNOSIS OF BEAU. HE HAD STAGE-FOUR GLIOBLASTOMA OF THE BRAIN, NOBODY... AND SO... BUT HERE IS THE KIND OF KID HE WAS. HE WAS A 45-YEAR-OLD MAN. HE WAS THE ATTORNEY GENERAL OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE. HE WAS A BRONZE STAR, A DECORATED WAR VETERAN THAT DIDN'T HAVE TO GO AND VOLUNTEERED TO GO FOR A YEAR. HE VOLUNTEERED TO GO TO KOSOVO, JUSTICE DEPARTMENT IN THE MIDDLE OF PRISTINE -- IN THE MIDDLE OF THE WAR. HE -- I MEAN, THIS WAS A KID WHO WAS JUST ABSOLUTELY... EVERYTHING ABOUT HIM WAS A SENSE OF DUTY AND OBLIGATION. YOU KNOW WHAT STRUCK ME ABOUT WHAT I READ ABOUT HIM IS THAT HE WAS GOING TO A CELEBRATION OF IRAQI WAR VETERANS, AND HE WON'T EVEN WEAR HIS... YEAH, HE WOULDN'T PUT ON HIS MEDALS. HE WOULDN'T WEAR HIS METALS. HE GOT A CALL FROM GENERAL ODIERNO. YEAH. SAID, ""BEAU, THIS IS AN ORDER. CAPTAIN, PUT ON YOUR MEDALS."" FIRST TIME HE EVER PUT THEM ON. WOW. WHEN HE WON THE BRONZE, HE SAID, ""DAD, DON'T TELL ANYBODY""... YEAH. ...""DON'T TELL PEOPLE ABOUT THIS, OKAY?"" WHEN HE WON THE BRONZE MEDAL, HE SAID, ""DON'T TELL ANYBODY."" NO, HE DIDN'T TELL ME TILL HE GOT HOME. OH. SO... BUT... AND WHEN HE WENT INTO SERVICE, HE SAID, ""I DON'T WANT TO USE THE NAME BIDEN."" YOU KNOW HOW THEY ALL HAVE... YEAH. I'VE BEEN IN AND OUT OF IRAQ AND AFGHANISTAN 28 TIMES, SO I GOT TO SEE HIM WHEN HE WAS THERE ON THREE DIFFERENT OCCASIONS, AND AT FIRST, HE WOULD NOT WEAR -- YOU KNOW, THEY HAVE THEIR NAME. RIGHT. HE GOT PERMISSION TO HAVE ANOTHER NAME. I THINK HE USED ""HUNTER,"" HIS MOTHER'S MAIDEN NAME, YOU KNOW, BUT HE WOULDN'T USE ""BIDEN"" BECAUSE HE DID NOT WANT TO BE TREATED ANY DIFFERENTLY. SO HOW DID HE TELL YOU... WELL... ...THAT WAS IT STAGE FOUR? HOW DID YOU HEAR? WELL, I WAS WITH HIM. HE WAS FIRST DIAGNOSED WITH HAVING HAD A STROKE. HE CAME OUT OF THE MILITARY. HE WAS DEEMED THE FITTEST GUY IN HIS BATTALION. THEY DO THESE TESTS. HE HAD -- I THINK IT WAS 9%, 10% BODY FAT. I MEAN, HE WAS A RUNNER, AND ONE DAY WHEN HE WAS RUNNING, HE STARTED TO KIND OF HALLUCINATE. MM. AND IT WORRIED HIM. HE DIDN'T WANT TO TELL ANYBODY, AND FINALLY, HE TOLD HIS BROTHER, WHO WAS HIS LIFELINE, HUNTER, ABOUT IT, AND THEY EVENTUALLY TOLD ME, AND THEN, ONE DAY, I'M GOING DOWN TO WASHINGTON AFTER BEING HOME ON THE WEEKEND, AND MY SECRET SERVICE AGENT COMES IN, AND HE SAYS, ""MR. VICE PRESIDENT, MR. VICE PRESIDENT, THE GENERAL IS DOWN. THE GENERAL IS DOWN,"" REFERRING TO MY SON, THE ATTORNEY GENERAL. HE SAID, ""HE'S DOWN. HE'S DOWN."" I CAME RUNNING OUT. I SAID, ""WHAT DO YOU MEAN?"" HE SAID, ""AN AMBULANCE IS COMING FOR HIM AT HIS HOME. HE'S DOWN. I DON'T KNOW WHAT..."" AND SO I GOT TO -- HIS HOUSE WAS ONLY A MILE AND A HALF AWAY. I RODE IN WITH HIM, AND HE WAS PARALYZED, AND HE LOST HIS ABILITY TO SPEAK, AND HE KEPT GOING, ""AH, AH..."" WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON? AND THEY DIAGNOSED, AND THEY DID THE MRI. THEY SHOWED WHERE THE CLOT WAS IN THE BRAIN. AND IT WAS DIAGNOSED, INITIALLY, AS A STROKE THAT RESOLVED ITSELF. IT'S A LONG STORY, DON'T WANT TO BORE YOU WITH IT, BUT NEXT THING, WELL, IT TURNS OUT IT WAS THE BEGINNING OF THE GROWTH OF THIS CANCER. MM. AND SO WHEN HE KEPT GETTING WORSE, WE WENT DOWN TO MD ANDERSON IN AUGUST, AND THEY DIAGNOSED HIM WITH STAGE-FOUR GLIOBLASTOMA, AND HUNTER AND ASHLEY AND JILL AND I AND HE ALL MADE A DEAL. WE WOULD NOT TALK ABOUT THE PERCENTAGES BECAUSE WE JUST HAD HOPE. WITHOUT HOPE, YOU CAN'T LIVE, AND SO THAT'S HOW I BEGAN TO GET KNOWLEDGE ABOUT CANCER. I TRIED TO LEARN EVERYTHING I POSSIBLY COULD ABOUT THE DISEASE. AND WHAT BEAU WOULD DO IS, I WOULD SEE HIM, AND HE'D SAY, ""DAD."" HE'D SAY, ""DAD, LOOK AT ME. STOP LOOKING SAD. DON'T LOOK SAD, DAD. NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENS, I'M GOING TO BE ALL RIGHT, DAD. YOU'VE GOT TO LOOK HAPPY. YOU'VE GOT TO LOOK STRONG FOR THE FAMILY, DAD. THE FAMILY NEEDS YOU TO LOOK STRONG, DAD."" AND I'M NOT EXAGGERATING. I MEAN, IT'S LIKE -- HE WAS A REMARKABLE YOUNG MAN. I'M NOT SUGGESTING OTHER PEOPLE... I'M JUST SPEAKING ABOUT HIM, THOUGH. IT WAS ALWAYS ABOUT EVERYBODY ELSE WITH BEAU. YOU KNOW, MY DAD HAD AN EXPRESSION WHEN GROWING UP HE WOULD TEACH. HE SAID, ""JOEY, NEVER EXPLAIN AND NEVER COMPLAIN."" I CAN SAY, GIVE MY WORD AS A BIDEN, I NEVER, ONE SINGLE TIME FROM THE MOMENT HE WAS BORN, EVER HEARD BEAU BIDEN COMPLAIN... MM. ...NOT ONE SINGLE TIME. IT IS A LOT EASIER FOR THE PRESS TO COVER WHETHER OR NOT HE GROPED A WOMAN OR WHETHER SHE SENT AN E-MAIL THAN IT IS TO DETERMINE HOW YOU PAY FOR FREE COLLEGE EDUCATION. YOU HAVE NO REGRET IN THE DEEPEST, QUIETEST, PUREST MOMENTS ABOUT NOT ACTUALLY RUNNING? IT'S BEEN A YEAR SINCE THE OPENING OF THE SMITHSONIAN NATIONAL MUSEUM OF AFRICAN AMERICAN HISTORY & CULTURE. NOW A RECORD-BREAKING NUMBER OF PEOPLE HAVE VISITED TO UNDERSTAND AND REFLECT ON OUR JOURNEY. Oprah: JOE BIDEN WAS BORN IN SCRANTON, PENNSYLVANIA. HE WAS RAISED BY HIS MOTHER, CATHERINE, AND HIS FATHER, JOSEPH SR., WHO CLEANED FURNACES AND LATER SOLD USED CARS. THE FAMILY LATER MOVED TO MAYFIELD, DELAWARE, WHERE JOE JR. WASHED WINDOWS AND WEEDED GARDENS TO HELP PAY TUITION FOR THE PRESTIGIOUS ARCHMERE ACADEMY, A PRIVATE SCHOOL JOE SAID WAS HIS DEEPEST DESIRE TO ATTEND. HE WOULD GO ON TO THE UNIVERSITY OF DELAWARE AND LATER LAW SCHOOL AT SYRACUSE. IN 1972, JOE BIDEN WAS ELECTED U.S. SENATOR FOR THE STATE OF DELAWARE. YOU KNOW, WHAT I WAS STRUCK BY, I READ THAT EVER SINCE YOU WERE A LITTLE BOY, YOU WERE A BOY WITH A VISION, THAT YOU HAD A PICTURE IN YOUR HEAD OF THE KIND OF MAN THAT YOU WANTED TO BE. DID YOU LIVE UP TO YOUR OWN EXPECTATIONS? DID YOU FULFILL THE VISION OR EXCEED THE VISION? I, BY AND LARGE, BELIEVE THAT I HAVE ENDED UP BEING THE MAN I WANTED TO BE, BUT IT WASN'T IN TERMS OF ACCOMPLISHMENT. MM. IT WAS BECAUSE PEOPLE USUALLY TRANSLATE THAT IN A, YOU KNOW, AS A YOUNG GUY, I KNEW I WANTED TO BE SENATOR. I KNEW I WANTED TO BE PRESIDENT. I KNEW -- THAT WASN'T TRUE. WHAT WAS TRUE WAS I WANT TO LIVE UP TO MY PARENTS' EXPECTATION. MM. AND I WANTED TO BE THAT PERSON THAT MET MY MOTHER'S STANDARD, BEING DEFINED BY MY COURAGE. I WANTED TO BE THAT PERSON WHO WAS, NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENED, JUST GOT BACK UP AND KEPT GOING. I WANTED TO BE THAT PERSON WHO WAS THERE AND LOYAL TO PEOPLE WHO WERE LOYAL TO HIM. I WANTED TO BE THERE. I WANTED TO BE THAT GUY WHO KNEW WHAT WAS WORTH LOSING OVER. DID YOU KNOW AS A LITTLE BOY, WHEN YOU HAD THE VISION AS A LITTLE BOY, WHEN YOU HAVE THIS PICTURE IN YOUR HEAD, WHAT WAS THE PICTURE? THE PICTURE, IT VARIED AS I GOT OLDER. WHAT IT CAME DOWN TO WAS, I REALIZED, EVERYTHING IN MY FAMILY AND IN MY FAITH WAS ABOUT THE ABUSE OF POWER, THAT WE HAD AN OBLIGATION TO CHALLENGE THE ABUSE OF POWER, WHETHER IT WAS STARTING OFF AS A KID IN THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT AND SIT-INS AND BEING THE ONLY WHITE EMPLOYEE IN THE EAST SIDE OF THE CITY, OR WHETHER IT WAS, YOU KNOW, CHALLENGING THE SAME THINGS WHEN I RAN FOR ELECTION THAT I KNEW WERE NOT POPULAR BUT I BELIEVED AND... MM-HMM. ...BECAUSE I BELIEVE PEOPLE ULTIMATELY REWARD YOU FOR AUTHENTICITY. DON'T YOU THINK, TOO -- THIS IS INTERESTING. WHEN I THINK ABOUT YOU, BECAUSE EVERYBODY KNOWS THAT YOU'RE GETTING ON THE TRAIN EVERY NIGHT AND GOING HOME AND, YOU KNOW, SWORN INTO OFFICE, ACTUALLY, IN THE HOSPITAL WHEN YOUR BOYS WERE THERE, AND SO YOU WERE A DEDICATED FATHER GOING BACK AND FORTH FROM DELAWARE TO D.C. DON'T YOU THINK THAT ACTUALLY BEING ON THAT TRAIN EVERY DAY WAS A... BEST THING THAT EVER HAPPENED TO ME. ...GROUNDING MECHANISM? ABSOLUTELY. BECAUSE I REMEMBER LIVING IN BALTIMORE, TAKING THE TRAIN TO NEW YORK OR GOING TO D.C., THERE WAS SOMETHING ABOUT LOOKING OUT THE WINDOW, WHICH I ACTUALLY LOVE EVEN NOW DRIVING IN A CAR AND SEEING PEOPLES' HOMES... ABSOLUTELY. ...YEAH, AND THINKING ABOUT... ABSOLUTELY. ...""I WONDER WHAT THEY'RE EATING TONIGHT.""    WHAT ARE THEY TALKING ABOUT AT THAT KITCHEN TABLE? WHAT ARE THEY TALKING ABOUT AT THE KITCHEN TABLE? YOU LOOK OUT ON THAT STRETCH BETWEEN BALTIMORE AND ABERDEEN... YEAH, YEAH. ...AND THEN SEE ALL THOSE LIGHTS ON, AND YOU WONDER, ""WHAT WERE THEY TALKING ABOUT?"" FOR EXAMPLE -- BY THE WAY, THE REASON I WENT HOME WAS I NEEDED MY KIDS MORE THAN THEY NEEDED ME. I MEAN, I REALLY DID, BUT, YOU KNOW, AS A PARENT, YOU KNOW A CHILD CAN ONLY HOLD AN IMPORTANT THOUGHT FOR ABOUT 12 HOURS. IF YOU MISS IT, YOU MISS IT. SO EVEN THOUGH I WASN'T OZZIE AND HARRIET, WE HAD BREAKFAST AND DINNER MADE, I'D GO HOME AND LIE IN BED WITH THEM, AND THEY'D TALK AND GET UP, AND SO... BUT THE THING THAT WAS THE BEST WOULD HAPPEN, YOU'D BE IN WASHINGTON, AND THERE'D BE A VOTE, AND YOU'D CROSS CONSTITUTION, AND THE COP WOULD STOP THE TRAFFIC, AND AFTER A WHILE, YOU'D BE GETTING TO THINK, ""WELL, WHAT TOOK HIM SO LONG, YOU KNOW?"" BUT YOU'D GET ON THE TRAIN, AND YOU'D GO HOME, AND THE SHOE-SHINE GUY, WHO'S A GOOD FRIEND OF MINE, WOULD SAY, ""JOE, WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING DOWN THERE, MAN? COME HERE."" YEAH. I MEAN, NOT A JOKE, NOT A JOKE. IF YOU NOTICE, IF YOU EVER BEEN TO DELAWARE, FROM THE TIME I RAN, I'VE BEEN REFERRED TO AS ""JOE."" THAT'S ALL. THEY DON'T CALL ME SENATOR. EVEN TODAY, THE SECRET SERVICE LOOKS WHEN THEY GO, ""HEY, JOE, COME HERE,"" YOU KNOW. THESE ARE CONSTITUENTS, AND THEY'RE KIND OF LIKE, ""OH, WHAT'S GOING ON HERE?"" BUT IT REALLY DOES GROUND YOU, MAN, BECAUSE THEY KNOW YOU. EVEN AFTER BECOMING VICE PRESIDENT? OH, ABSOLUTELY! SO IT REALLY KEEPS YOU FROM EVER GETTING TO THE POINT WHERE YOU FEEL SELF-IMPORTANT. YEAH. I KNOW THIS SOUNDS LIKE HYPERBOLE, BUT IT REALLY IS TRUE. IT WAS A GIFT. IF IT KEEPS YOU SO CONNECTED TO THE PEOPLE AND WHERE THE PEOPLE ARE, AND EVERYBODY NOW KNOWS HOW BADLY THE MEDIA GOT IT WRONG, YOU MUST HAVE HAD SOME INKLING. YOU MUST'VE HAD -- YOU MUST'VE NOT HAVE BEEN SHOCKED THEN ON ELECTION NIGHT... OPRAH... ...IF YOU WERE ACTUALLY ON THE TRAIN TALKING TO PEOPLE WITH THE PEOPLE. I DIDN'T DRIVE... AS VICE PRESIDENT, I TOOK THE TRAIN ON THE WEEKEND. I DIDN'T GO EVERY DAY, BUT I DID 83 EVENTS, AND A MONTH OUT, I CAME BACK AND SAID, ""WE'RE GOING TO LOSE THIS ELECTION."" A MONTH OUT? A MONTH OUT. MM. AND THE REASON I DID, YOU KNOW, I KNOW I'M CALLED ""MIDDLE CLASS JOE"". IN WASHINGTON, THAT'S NOT MEANT AS A COMPLIMENT. IT MEANS YOU'RE NOT SOPHISTICATED, YOU KNOW. BUT WHAT WAS HAPPENING IS THE REASON I BELIEVE WE WERE GOING TO LOSE -- AND I THINK HILLARY WOULD'VE BEEN A GREAT PRESIDENT. I REALLY DO. I THINK SHE WOULD'VE BEEN A GREAT PRESIDENT. BUT THERE'S TWO STUDIES THAT JUST CAME OUT. ONE WAS ANNENBERG SCHOOL. I FORGET THE OTHER ONE. I APOLOGIZE NOW, BUT IT LOOKED AT ALL THE WORDS UTTERED IN A CAMPAIGN. HOW MANY OF THOSE WORDS RELATED TO AN ISSUE? FEWER WORDS WERE UTTERED RELATED TO ANY SPECIFIC ISSUE THIS LAST CAMPAIGN THAN ANY CAMPAIGN IN THE LAST 10 PRESIDENTIAL RACES. NOW YOU ARE AN INCREDIBLY WELL-INFORMED PERSON. I'LL BET YOU CAN'T FIND 10 FRIENDS WHO CAN TELL YOU WHAT HILLARY'S POSITION WAS ON CHILD CARE, NOT GENERICALLY, SPECIFICALLY. RIGHT. HOW WE'RE GOING TO HAVE FREE COLLEGE EDUCATION, HOW IT'S GOING TO BE PAID FOR, ALL THE THINGS THAT MATTER TO THOSE PEOPLE -- AND BY THE WAY, WE WOULDN'T BE HAVING THIS DISCUSSION BUT FOR 172,000 VOTES. LET US PUT THAT IN PERSPECTIVE TOO, OKAY? MM-HMM. MM-HMM. BUT IN THE STATES, THEY HAD ME GOING IN, I SPENT ALL MY TIME IN PENNSYLVANIA, OHIO, MINNESOTA, MICHIGAN, WISCONSIN, FLORIDA, VIRGINIA. THEY'RE THE PLACES -- AND THIS IS NOT A CRITICISM, BUT I THINK WHAT HAPPENED IS WE GOT TO THE POINT WHERE IT BECAME IDENTITY POLITICS. MM-HMM. AND THEY LEARNED THE WRONG LESSONS FROM BARACK'S BRILLIANT CAMPAIGNS HE RAN. AND FOR EXAMPLE, THE END OF THE CAMPAIGN, I WENT UP TO A UNION HALL TO MAKE A POINT, AND I SAID, ""YOU KNOW, ONE OF THE REASONS HILLARY HAS TO WIN..."" THERE'S LIKE 2,000 UNION GUYS. ""SO ONE OF THE REASONS HILLARY HAS TO WIN? IMPORTANT BECAUSE THEY NEED EQUAL PAY FOR WOMEN."" PLACE WENT NUTS. YOU KNOW WHY? ALL THEIR WIVES WERE THE POLITICAL TYPES. THEY DON'T LIKE THE FACT THEIR WIFE ISN'T BEING PAID WHERE THE WIVES WHO AREN'T BEING PAID FAIRLY ARE IN CORPORATIONS AND LAW FIRMS IN SILICON VALLEY, BUT THESE GUYS' WIVES ARE HIGH SCHOOL-EDUCATED KIDS, AND THEY'RE NOT GOTTEN PAID. AND I SAID, ""AND SECONDLY, LOOK, IT'S NONE OF YOUR BUSINESS WHO THE HELL YOU MARRIED, MAN. LET WELL ENOUGH ALONE, PERIOD."" CHEERED! THEY'RE CHEERING! I'M NOT JOKING. NOW THE PRESS SAID, ""ONLY BIDEN COULD DO THAT."" THAT'S NOT TRUE. YOU GOT TO STATE WHAT YOU'RE FOR, AND IF YOU GET SUCKERED INTO NOT HAVING THE TIME -- IN FAIRNESS TO THE PRESS, IT'S A LOT EASIER FOR THE PRESS TO COVER WHETHER OR NOT HE GROPED A WOMAN OR WHETHER SHE SENT AN E-MAIL THAN IT IS TO DETERMINE HOW YOU PAY FOR FREE COLLEGE EDUCATION, THAN IT IS TO GO IN AND LOOK AT WHAT YOUR POSITION IS ON REAL TAX EQUITY. I MEAN, IT'S JUST EASIER. IT'S EASIER, AND IT'S ALMOST LIKE THEY CAN'T NOT COVER IT. THEY CAN'T NOT COVER IT, AND SO IF YOU LOOK AT ALL THE COVERAGE, THERE'S HARDLY ANY COVERAGE ABOUT THE THINGS THAT MATTER TO THE LIVES OF ORDINARY PEOPLE. DO YOU FEEL THAT YOU COULD'VE BEATEN HILLARY? HOW CAN YOU HELP US AS A NATION BRING DIGNITY BACK TO OUR CONVERSATIONS? YOU HAVE NO REGRET IN THE DEEPEST, QUIETEST, PUREST MOMENTS ABOUT NOT ACTUALLY RUNNING? I HAVE A REGRET THAT I AM NOT PRESIDENT, BECAUSE I THINK THERE'S SO MUCH OPPORTUNITY. MM. I THINK AMERICA IS SO INCREDIBLY WELL-POSITIONED. BUT I DON'T REGRET THE DECISION I MADE BECAUSE IT WAS THE RIGHT DECISION FOR MY FAMILY. OPRAH, NO WOMAN OR MAN SHOULD ANNOUNCE THEY'RE RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT UNLESS THEY CAN ANSWER TWO QUESTIONS. YEAH. ONE, DO THEY TRULY BELIEVE THEY'RE THE MOST QUALIFIED PERSON FOR THAT MOMENT? I BELIEVED I WAS, BUT WAS I PREPARED TO BE ABLE TO GIVE MY WHOLE HEART, MY WHOLE SOUL, AND ALL MY ATTENTION TO THE ENDEAVOR? AND I KNEW I WASN'T. WERE YOU STILL BROKEN? MY FAMILY WAS BROKEN. I WAS BROKEN, AND I FIND MYSELF EVEN, LIKE, YOU KNOW, THIS IS WHY I KNOW THERE WAS SEXISM IN THE CAMPAIGN. I WOULD BE SPEAKING SOMEWHERE AND SOMEONE WOULD YELL, ""BEAU BIDEN"" AND I'D SAY, ""BEAU,"" AND I'D FIND MYSELF BREAKING DOWN, AND PEOPLE WOULD SAY, ""WASN'T HE A GOOD FATHER?"" IF HILLARY BROKE DOWN, THEY WOULD'VE SAID, ""SHE'S PLAYING THE WOMAN CARD."" MM-HMM. MM-HMM. SO IT WAS... SO I JUST KNEW. I JUST... DO YOU FEEL YOU THAT COULD'VE BEATEN HILLARY? I... YES, BUT IT WOULD'VE BEEN AN INCREDIBLY DIFFICULT RACE, AND I HAVE NOTHING BUT FRIENDSHIP FOR HILLARY. DID YOU NOT WANT TO TAKE THAT ON? BECAUSE WHEN EVERYONE WAS GETTING EXCITED ABOUT THE POSSIBILITY OF YOU JOINING THE RACE, THERE WAS ALSO OBVIOUSLY A LOT OF SPECULATION THAT YOU WOULDN'T WANT TO GET IN AND TAKE ON... YES. ...THE CLINTON FACTOR. WELL, HERE IS WHAT THE SPECULATION WAS. YOU'RE RIGHT ABOUT THAT. MM-HMM. THE OTHER SPECULATION WAS BIDEN WOULDN'T WANT TO BE THE GUY DENYING A WOMAN THE OPPORTUNITY. YEAH. YEAH. IT WAS REAL SIMPLE. MY SON WAS DYING. MM. I COULDN'T TELL ANYBODY.    THE ONLY PERSON I COULD CONFIDE IN WAS BARACK. HE'S THE ONLY ONE WHO HAD TO KNOW, SO WHAT I WASN'T ABLE TO DO -- HILLARY, AS I SAID, IS A FRIEND. WHEN SHE WAS SECRETARY OF STATE WE HAD BREAKFAST ONCE A WEEK AT MY HOME, SO SHE CALLED ME, AND SHE WANTED -- I'M SURE SHE DOESN'T MIND MY SAYING THIS -- SHE CALLED ME. SHE WANTED TO COME DOWN AND TALK ABOUT THE RACE. SHE WANTED TO KNOW WHETHER I WAS GOING TO RUN. WHETHER YOU WERE GOING TO RUN OR NOT. AND I SAT DOWN, AND I SAID, ""HILLARY, LOOK. IT'S MUCH LESS LIKELY THAT I RUN THAN NOT RUN, BUT IF I DO, IT'LL BE STRAIGHT UP. IT'S NOT ABOUT YOU. IT'S ABOUT ME."" BUT WE HAD SOME HOPE BECAUSE I WAS TOLD THAT THEY DECIDED TO TRY SOME EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES ON DEALING WITH GLIOBLASTOMA. THEY INJECTED HIM WITH A THING CALLED ANTI-PD-1, AND THEY INJECTED A VIRUS INTO HIS BRAIN, AND THERE WAS THIS ONE FAINT POSSIBILITY. SO IT GAVE YOU HOPE FOR HOW LONG? WELL, WE NEVER GAVE UP HOPE, BUT IT WAS... WE THOUGHT IN JANUARY -- I THOUGHT IN JANUARY OR FEBRUARY THERE WAS A 25% CHANCE MAYBE WE BEAT THE ODDS. MM. BUT WHAT I COULDN'T DO, BECAUSE HE WOULD'VE KILLED ME -- IF I ANNOUNCED I WASN'T RUNNING BECAUSE OF MY SON BECAUSE HE WANTED ME TO RUN. YEAH. WHEN DID HE TELL YOU TO RUN? BECAUSE THAT BECAME... I THOUGHT YOU WERE GOING TO RUN JUST BECAUSE OF BEAU'S WISH THAT YOU WOULD RUN. EVERY THANKSGIVING FOR 42 YEARS SINCE I MET JILL, WE WOULD GO TO NANTUCKET FOR THANKSGIVING WHEN THEY WERE LITTLE BOYS... MM-HMM. ...SO WE WOULDN'T OFFEND HER PARENTS, MY PARENTS, AND/OR MY DECEASED WIFE'S PARENTS. THEY WERE ALL GOING. THIS WAS A NUCLEAR HOLIDAY. NOW 16 OF US TRUDGE UP. AND SO WE WERE IN NANTUCKET, AND WE DID THE CHRISTMAS LIGHTING. BEAU WAS SICK, AND HE SAID, ""DAD, WE GOT TO TALK,"" AND WE WENT BACK TO THE HOUSE WE WERE STAYING IN AND THEN SAT DOWN AND SAID, ""YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND, DAD. WE WANT YOU TO RUN."" THIS WAS HUNT AND BEAU, AND HUNT ARGUED THIS WILL KEEP THE FAMILY TOGETHER. IT WILL GIVE US PURPOSE, BUT I JUST DIDN'T HAVE THE COURAGE TO DO IT. I JUST DIDN'T THINK I COULD SAY TO THE PUBLIC THAT, YOU KNOW, THIS IS... I'M NOT GOING TO DIVERT WHEN MY LITTLE GRANDSON SAYS, ""POP, YOU SMELL LIKE DADDY. CAN I LIE DOWN WITH YOU?"" MM. YOU KNOW? BY THE WAY, A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE THAT, BUT AS I'M PRESIDENT, I KNEW I COULDN'T... NOW THEY DIDN'T MAKE ANY DEMANDS. THE WHOLE FAMILY GOT TOGETHER EVEN AFTER BEAU PASSED AND SAID, ""YOU'VE GOT TO RUN, JOE."" JILL WANTED ME TO RUN, BUT I JUST -- IN THE END, THE DECISION WAS ""NO"" BECAUSE WHAT? YOU DIDN'T HAVE THE EYE OF THE TIGER? BECAUSE I DIDN'T HAVE THE EYE OF THE TIGER. I KNEW THAT I WAS STILL SO, UM... I KNEW I WAS MISSING HIM SO THAT I DIDN'T THINK I COULD DO THE JOB THAT I WOULD HAVE TO DO, BUT THAT'S NOT SAYING, DO I REGRET NOT BEING PRESIDENT? YEAH, I DO, BUT I MADE THE RIGHT DECISION FOR MY FAMILY, I BELIEVE, AT THAT TIME, AND I THOUGHT THAT WE HAD A REALLY INCREDIBLY QUALIFIED CANDIDATE TO BE PRESIDENT, SO I DIDN'T FEEL LIKE I WAS LEAVING THE FIELD, AND BECAUSE I LEFT THE FIELD THAT THERE WASN'T ANYBODY WHO COULD, YOU KNOW, RUN THE COUNTRY. I DIDN'T FEEL THAT WAY. HAS THERE BEEN A THOUGHT OR CONSIDERATION FOR 2020? OVER 2 MILLION PEOPLE HAVE MADE THE TRIP TO WASHINGTON, D.C. TO EXPERIENCE THE PLIGHT AND TRIUMPH DISPLAYED WITHIN THE SMITHSONIAN NATIONAL MUSEUM OF AFRICAN AMERICAN HISTORY & CULTURE. WE HONOR AND CELEBRATE THIS 1-YEAR-OLD NATIONAL TREASURE. FOLKS, EACH OF YOU HAS A RESPONSIBILITY. YOU ALL KNOW IT. YOU'VE BEEN TAUGHT IT HERE. YOU WERE TAUGHT IT BEFORE YOU CAME HERE, TO TREAT PEOPLE WITH DIGNITY. YOU DEMAND IT FOR YOURSELVES. YOU DEMAND THAT YOU BE TREATED THAT WAY, AND ALL OF US, ALL OF US HAVE TO DO BETTER WHEN IT COMES TO BUILDING THE BONDS OF EMPATHY THAT FOLKS WHO AREN'T LIKE US... ...AREN'T LIKE US, CAN KNOW WE UNDERSTAND THEM. LIFE CAN'T BE LIVED IN THIS SELF-REFERENTIAL, SELF-REINFORCING, SELF-RIGHTEOUS ECHO CHAMBER WE BUILD FOR OURSELVES ONLINE. LIVING IN OUR SCREENS ENCOURAGES SHALLOW AND ANTISEPTIC RELATIONSHIPS THAT MAKE IT EASY TO REDUCE OTHERS TO STEREOTYPES. HOW CAN YOU HELP US AS A NATION BRING DIGNITY BACK TO OUR CONVERSATIONS? I HEARD YOU SPEAK ABOUT THIS. BY ACTING WITH DIGNITY... YEAH. ...BY NOT GETTING DOWN INTO THE MOSH PIT. RIGHT. SO FROM A BIGGER POINT OF VIEW, SOCIAL, SPIRITUAL POINT OF VIEW, WHERE WE ARE AS A NATION, AS A CULTURE OF PEOPLE, HOW BAD IS IT, DO YOU THINK? I DON'T THINK IT'S -- LET ME TELL YOU WHAT I THINK THE UNDERLYING CAUSE OF ANGST IS. IT GOES BEYOND POLITICS. WE'RE GOING THROUGH SUCH A GIGANTIC TRANSITION. THE CONSEQUENCE OF DIGITALIZATION, SUPERCOMPUTING CAPABILITY, ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE, THE ABILITY TO DO THINGS THAT HAD TO BE DONE BY AN INDIVIDUAL NO LONGER HAVING TO BE DONE CAN BE DONE BY A MACHINE IS SCARING THE LIVING HELL OUT OF PEOPLE. MY DAD USED TO HAVE AN EXPRESSION, ""JOEY, A JOB IS ABOUT A LOT MORE THAN A PAYCHECK. IT'S ABOUT YOUR DIGNITY, YOUR RESPECT, YOUR PLACE IN THE COMMUNITY, BEING ABLE TO LOOK YOUR KID IN THE EYE AND SAY, 'IT'S GOING TO BE OKAY.' THAT'S WHAT A JOB IS ABOUT."" AND SO NOW YOU HAVE GOT TENS OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE, MILLIONS OF PEOPLE, BLACK AND WHITE, LOOKING OUT THERE AND HEARING THE DEBATE GOING ON ABOUT GLOBALIZATION, AND THE QUESTION IS, HOW DO YOU ADJUST THAT GLOBALIZATION TO MEET PEOPLES' NEEDS? SO HAS THERE BEEN A THOUGHT OR CONSIDERATION FOR 2020? NO, NOT YET. NO? AND I SAY THAT ""NOT YET"" BECAUSE, LOOK, I'M A GREAT RESPECTER OF FATE. I DON'T PLAN ON RUNNING, BUT I TELL YOU WHAT, I PLAN ON GOING, AND HERE IS MY PROBLEM. YOU KNOW, I LEARNED HOW TO BECOME ONE OF THE MOST POPULAR ELECTED OFFICIALS IN THE UNITED STATES. I'M ACTUALLY NOT RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT. IT'S AMAZING. BOOM, THINGS GO. YOU KNOW, IT REALLY GETS GOOD, BUT I'M ASKED TO SPEAK A LOT IN POLITICAL FORA, AND I'M DOING IT NOT AS NEARLY AS OFTEN AS I'M ASKED, BECAUSE EVERY TIME I'M ASKED, THEY SAY THEY TRANSLATED IT AS I'M RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT. BUT I'M GOING TO DO EVERYTHING I CAN TO CHANGE THE DYNAMIC HERE BECAUSE I THINK WE CAN WIN BACK THE HOUSE, AND I THINK WE HAVE A SHOT AT THE SENATE, AND YOU KNOW, THE OTHER EXPRESSION MY DAD USED WAS, ""LOOK, DON'T COMPARE ME TO THE ALMIGHTY. COMPARE ME TO THE ALTERNATIVE."" WELL, RIGHT NOW, I LOOK AWFUL GOOD. BUT I CAN GO OUT AND DO THAT, RAISE MONEY AND DO THOSE THINGS, BUT I'M NOT SITTING HERE NOW. I'M, AS I SAID, A GREAT RESPECTER OF FATE. I'M OVER 70. I'M, THANK GOD, RIGHT NOW, IN AWFUL GOOD HEALTH, YOU KNOW, BUT I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE HELL WHAT THINGS ARE GOING TO BE 2 YEARS FROM NOW. I JUST DON'T KNOW. SO I PROMISE YOU I'M NOT DOING ANYTHING TO ORGANIZE RUNNING, BUT I'M GOING TO GO OUT THERE AND CONTINUE TO DO WHAT I'VE DONE SINCE I'VE BEEN 26 YEARS OLD... MM-HMM. ...HOLLER. WHAT IS IT, DO YOU THINK, THAT IT'S ABOUT POWER THAT CHANGES PEOPLE, AND HOW HAVE YOU MANAGED THE POWER YOU'VE HELD? WHAT HAPPENS IN THAT MOMENT WHEN YOU CAN LITERALLY SEE THE SPIRIT GOES SOMEPLACE? WHAT IS IT, DO YOU THINK, THAT IT'S ABOUT POWER THAT CHANGES PEOPLE, AND HOW HAVE YOU MANAGED THE POWER YOU'VE HELD? WELL, I HAVEN'T HELD THAT MUCH POWER. MY POWER, THE REASON I'M VIEWED AS HAVING THAT POWER IS ALL... THERE'S NO POWER IN THE VICE PRESIDENCY. IT'S ALL REFLECTIVE, AND IT COMES FROM THE PRESIDENT. BUT I THINK THE PEOPLE ABUSE POWER IS THAT THEY, IN FACT, ARE SEDUCED BY THE NOTION THAT THEY ARE SO SELF-IMPORTANT THAT THEY REALLY MATTER WHEN, IN FACT, IT IS NOT USUALLY THE CASE. THE ONLY WAY -- THE LEADERS I'VE OBSERVED WHO WERE THE BEST ARE THE ONES WHO HAVE COURAGE TO TAKE A CHANCE, BE WILLING TO LOSE ON PRINCIPLE, AND TWO, ARE SELF-AWARE. THEY UNDERSTAND THEIR STRENGTHS, AND THEY UNDERSTAND THEIR WEAKNESSES. THEY PLAY TO THEIR STRENGTHS, AND THEY TRY TO SHORE UP THEIR WEAKNESSES, AND THE PEOPLE WHO DON'T DO THAT ARE THE PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT SELF-AWARE ENOUGH TO KNOW WHAT THEIR -- BECAUSE MOST OF THE TIME, THAT ABUSE ENDS UP BEING THEIR DOWNFALL AS WELL. WE SEE SO MUCH ON THE NEWS EVERY DAY, RAGE AND ANGER ON BOTH SIDES. WHAT DO YOU THINK IS THE SOURCE OF ALL THIS RAGE AND FUROR? WELL, I THINK IT'S BECAUSE THEY THINK THE SYSTEM HAS FAILED THEM. I THINK THEY LOOK OUT AT THE CONGRESS, AND FOR THE LAST -- SINCE BARACK GOT ELECTED, THE FIRST THING REPUBLICANS DID WAS SAY, ""HOW CAN WE KEEP HIM FROM SUCCEEDING AT ALL?"" YEAH. AND SO THE CONGRESS HAS BEEN SITTING DOWN... WHEN YOU THINK OF -- ...I THINK, AT 11%. WHEN I WAS IN THE CONGRESS, WE WERE MORE DIVIDED, BUT WE ACTUALLY KNEW THERE HAD TO BE WORK TOGETHER TO GET CONSENSUS, TO GET THINGS DONE. I ALSO THINK THEY LOOK OUT AT THE POLITICAL SYSTEM, AND THEY THINK THAT THEY ARE POWERLESS. THEY'RE POWERLESS BECAUSE THEY DON'T POSSESS MONEY AND POWER TO INFLUENCE VOTES, INFLUENCE OUTCOMES. WHAT ARE YOU MOST PROUD OF, JOE? I'M MOST PROUD OF, AT LEAST TO THIS POINT, OF HAVING SERVED AS LONG AS I DID, AND DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS STILL ACCEPTING MY WORD AND TREATING ME AS IF I'M HONORABLE. I AM PROUD OF BEING ABLE TO SAY THAT I NEVER VOTED FOR ANYTHING THAT I DISAGREED WITH. MM. WHEN I WAS AGNOSTIC ABOUT IT, I'D LOOK AT WHATEVER MY CONSTITUENTS WANTED. I WOULD VOTE FOR IT, BUT I NEVER VOTED FOR ANYTHING THAT I FELT WAS WRONG. NOW THAT YOU'VE HAD TIME TO WRITE A BOOK AND REFLECT ON YOUR LIFE AND DECISIONS, DO YOU THINK DIFFERENTLY ABOUT THAT MOMENT WHEN PRESIDENT OBAMA WAS GIVING YOU THE MEDAL OF FREEDOM? WHAT STRUCK ME ABOUT THAT MOMENT IS YOU KEPT SAYING, ""I DON'T DESERVE THIS,"" AND I WAS THINKING, ""OF COURSE, YOU DESERVE IT."" DO YOU THINK... WELL, YOU KNOW... ...DIFFERENTLY NOW THAT... I STILL DON'T THINK... YOU DON'T? LOOK, I THINK I'M A... I HOPE I'M A DECENT MAN. I HOPE I'VE DONE SOME GOOD, BUT TO SINGLE ME OUT AS ONE OF -- YOU THINK, OR YOU KNOW? WELL, I THINK I KNOW I'VE DONE SOME GOOD. [ LAUGHS ] ALL RIGHT. BUT, YOU KNOW, I THINK THAT'S... I THINK THERE'S OTHER PEOPLE A BIT MORE DESERVING THAN ME. REALLY? I REALLY DO. YEAH. WHAT IS YOUR DEFINITION OF FREEDOM AS IT PERTAINS TO YOUR OWN LIFE? CONTINUING TO BE ABLE TO SAY WHAT I BELIEVE WITHOUT FEAR OF ANYTHING OTHER THAN SIGNIFICANT DISAGREEMENT, KNOWING THAT I STILL LIVE IN A COUNTRY WHERE I CAN SAY OR DO WHATEVER I BELIEVE, AND IT WILL BE PROTECTED. WHAT IS THE ONE THING PEOPLE WANT TO HEAR AT THE END OF THEIR LIVES? WHAT HAPPENS IN THAT MOMENT WHEN YOU CAN LITERALLY SEE THE SPIRIT GOES SOMEPLACE? Oprah: CELEBRATING THE 1-YEAR ANNIVERSARY OF THE OPENING OF THE SMITHSONIAN NATIONAL MUSEUM OF AFRICAN AMERICAN HISTORY & CULTURE. HUNDREDS OF YEARS ON THE JOURNEY, AND NOW MILLIONS HAVE MADE A PILGRIMAGE TO EXPERIENCE OUR COLLECTIVE STORY. WHAT IS THE ONE THING PEOPLE WANT TO HEAR AT THE END OF THEIR LIVES? AS WE IRISH SAY, ""YOU'RE A GOOD MAN, OR YOU'RE A GOOD WOMAN."" MM. THEY WANT TO KNOW THAT, AT THE END OF THEIR LIVES, THAT IT WAS WORTHWHILE, THAT PEOPLE WHO LOVED THEM... THAT'S WHY... BUT ANYWAY... ""THAT'S WHY"", GO AHEAD. THAT'S WHY IT'S SO IMPORTANT TO TELL YOUR MOTHER OR FATHER WHO'S DYING, IF YOU HAVE A CHANCE TO BE WITH THEM. THAT'S WHY IT'S SO IMPORTANT TO BE WITH THEM AND TELL THEM, TELL THEM ALL ABOUT HOW MUCH YOU LOVE THEM. TELL THEM HOW MUCH THEY DID FOR YOU. TALK TO THEM. AND THAT'S ONE OF THE GREAT THINGS I GOT TO DO WITH MY MOTHER AND FATHER AND MY SON, BEAU. I MEAN, I WAS THERE HOLDING HIS HAND. I MEAN, YOU KNOW, IT WAS... WHAT WAS THAT LAST MOMENT? HE LOOKED AT ME, AND HE SAID, ""DAD, I'M NOT AFRAID. I'M OKAY."" I ALWAYS WEAR THIS ROSARY, AND HE HAD IT ON AT THAT TIME, AND IT WAS AT THE VERY END, AND HIS BROTHER WAS SITTING THERE, AND THE THREE OF US WERE HOLDING HANDS, AND HE WANTED TO REASSURE US. BUT WE GOT A CHANCE TO TELL HIM, WE GOT A CHANCE TO TELL MY MOM, WE GOT A CHANCE TO TELL MY DAD... IS THAT A SACRED HOLY MOMENT? IS THAT WHAT... WHAT HAPPENS IN THAT MOMENT WHEN YOU CAN LITERALLY SEE THE SPIRIT GOES SOMEPLACE? IS THAT... YEAH, IT IS. IT IS. THAT'S WHAT THE SOUL IS. MM-HM. THAT'S... LOOK, I MEAN, THE SOUL IS ETERNITY. THE SOUL IS REDEMPTION. THE SOUL IS THE PLACE WHERE FORGIVENESS HAPPENS. THE SOUL IS WHERE YOU CONTINUE TO LIVE. I MEAN, I KNOW MY BOY IS WITH ME. MM. I KNOW MY DAUGHTER AND HIS WIFE AND HIS BROTHER AND HIS MOTHER KNOW HE'S STILL WITH US. YOU KNOW, MY NUMBER-TWO GRANDDAUGHTER, FINNEGAN, THEY HAD... I WALKED OUT. THEY WERE THERE IN THE HALLWAY WHEN THE LAST DOCTORS TOLD US WHAT TO EXPECT, AND MY FIVE GRANDCHILDREN WERE TALKING, THE THREE OLDEST. AND I HEARD FINNEGAN SAY, ""WWBD,"" AND I SAID ""HONEY, WHAT'S THAT?"" SHE SAID, ""NO, WE'RE JUST TALKING, POP,"" AND I SAID, ""WHAT'S THAT MEAN, HONEY?"" SHE SAID, ""WHAT WOULD BEAU DO?"" WHAT WOULD BEAU DO? WHAT WOULD BEAU DO? YOU KNOW, YOU HAVE TO GET TO THE POINT... I DID ""THE COLBERT SHOW"" A WHILE AGO, AND IT WAS MUCH MORE REVEALING THAN I EVER ANTICIPATED IT WAS GOING TO BE. MM-HMM. I SAW THAT. AND I CAME HOME, AND MY SON, HUNTER, SAID, ""DAD, NOW YOU'VE TALKED ABOUT BEAU."" HE SAID, ""NOW IT'S TIME WE TALK ABOUT WHAT BEAU WANTED US TO DO. NOW IT'S TIME FOR US TO TALK ABOUT WHAT BEAU WANTS, NOT ABOUT OUR LOSS, BUT ABOUT WHAT HE WANTS. WHAT WOULD HE BE DOING?"" I FIND REAL SOLACE IN THAT, AND SO DOES MY WHOLE FAMILY.

television about PRON highly anticipate and deeply personal new book promise PRON dad a year of hope hardship and purpose what do have to revisit all of the major moment in PRON life teach PRON about where PRON be now regard as one of the most influential vice president in history joe biden reflect on this tumultuous period of american politic a month out i come back and say we re go to lose this election PRON share PRON family spiritual and emotional journey after the heartbreaking death of PRON son beau what happen in that moment when PRON can literally see the spirit go someplace PRON resilience in the face of public scrutiny PRON be teach to just to get up when PRON get knock down just get up and why the decision not to run for president still weigh on PRON be i prepare to be able to give PRON whole heart PRON whole soul and all PRON attention to the endeavor and i know i wasn t do PRON feel that PRON could ve beat hillary so thank PRON for be here mr vice president i m happy to be here i know come all the way to california be oh i m delighted to be here it be always a pleasure to be here i want to start with the moment that PRON all get to see PRON experience on cbs when PRON do the letter to PRON i find that so move last year PRON write a letter to PRON young self that start with dear joe PRON stutter be debilitate PRON embarrass PRON and the bully be vicious but listen to mom when PRON say bravery reside in every heart and PRON be fierce and clear PRON do say that ahh i just think that be not an easy first sentence and the rest of the letter as be PRON new book just as personal so what do come to term with write this book and have to revisit all of the major moment in PRON life teach PRON about where PRON be now well PRON know PRON mother use to say and i think PRON be so cruel at one point especially when i lose PRON wife and daughter and PRON walk out of the hospital late a tractor trailer have broadside and kill PRON and PRON two son be badly injure and PRON say joey grab PRON hand and PRON say out of everything horrible something good will come if PRON look hard enough for PRON but that be PRON mother notion PRON be teach to just to get up when PRON get knock down just get up and move forward and talk about how so many people without the kind of help that i have do PRON every day right right today there be somebody who have go through something that be significantly bad than PRON and PRON have nobody behind PRON and they re get up and they re move and PRON give PRON such overwhelming confidence in people the ability to absorb pain and the spiritual reassurance that come from know they re still a part of PRON would PRON say that that be one of the most important spiritual characteristic to have that be to keep get up absolutely absolutely because PRON know it i m not say it easy i have to admit to PRON there have be a couple time in PRON well one in particular in PRON life where i have actually lose PRON faith where i go through a period of thinking how could this be i mean why PRON know like the why PRON piece mm hmm PRON dad who be a wonderful well read graceful high school educate guy say champ where be PRON write that life owe PRON a living man i know but PRON doesn t make PRON feel any better in the moment well what PRON make PRON make PRON at least in PRON family PRON mother think the great virtue of all be courage and because PRON allow all the other virtue to exist and from the time i be a kid not a joke PRON mother would go look at PRON joey mm hmm look at PRON remember you re define by PRON courage wow and you re redeem by PRON loyalty look at PRON joey and PRON be this notion that PRON could do anything because there be this notion in PRON faith PRON family that those PRON lose remain a part of PRON mm hmm but it be hard to get there it be hard to get to the place where a memory bring a smile to PRON lip before PRON bring a tear to PRON eye mm hmm i mean it be a hard thing to go through but i be lucky i always have you ve be through PRON a few time well a lot of people have be through PRON yeah in just week after win PRON first race for senator of delaware vice president biden first wife neilia and PRON month old daughter naomi be kill in a car accident PRON son hunter and beau be age and at the time PRON be injure but survive in beau biden a decorate war veteran and delaware attorney general lose PRON battle with brain cancer beau be year old so when PRON get that call and you re live in that space of disbelief that this have actually happen and PRON think that this be the bad possible thing that could ever happen to PRON but PRON have somehow be train by PRON parent by PRON belief system to look for the opportunity within every tragedy but that doesn t come easy no no PRON doesn t look i mean i still i still find PRON when i talk about PRON beau PRON son yeah who die and i sometimes find PRON say something about PRON and i can t handle PRON i start to i break down so it be not like the pain ever go away but what i do be i look at PRON grandson PRON son mm hmm i see PRON i look at PRON granddaughter i see PRON and i know he be still here i know he be still with PRON but when PRON lose naomi PRON baby daughter in the car accident with PRON first wife no preparation the shock of PRON the horror of PRON it be quite different isn t PRON when PRON have have some preparation know that beau be sick for a while or be PRON it be different and it be probably different for every person but for PRON when what happen to PRON wife and daughter happen i have i have a reason to live i have a reason by these two little boy who be in the hospital and PRON know i say at the time i probably should ve never say PRON all those year ago i say i can understand how someone could be completely thoroughly sane and commit suicide and decide that look i ve be to the top of the mountain mm hmm i m not get there again i have PRON all and there be just PRON know mm hmm so long but i have those two boy and ironically PRON end up raise PRON oprah not a joke i mean to this day PRON son hunter who be part of PRON soul if PRON walk off out of here and PRON say hey dad can i get PRON anything he d come up and give PRON a kiss he year old the smart guy i know he d give PRON a kiss dad PRON need anything PRON okay dad call PRON ask PRON PRON lose PRON mother PRON lose so there be reinforcement watch someone who PRON adore who really be part of PRON soul i mean not it be not hyperbole watch PRON go through with such grace but such awful pain die know that the likelihood that PRON be go to be able to survive be virtually nonexistent so PRON get the diagnosis of beau PRON have stage four glioblastoma of the brain nobody and so but here be the kind of kid PRON be PRON be a year old man PRON be the attorney general of the state of delaware PRON be a bronze star a decorate war veteran that didn t have to go and volunteer to go for a year PRON volunteer to go to kosovo justice department in the middle of pristine in the middle of the war PRON i mean this be a kid who be just absolutely everything about PRON be a sense of duty and obligation PRON know what strike PRON about what i read about PRON be that PRON be go to a celebration of iraqi war veteran and PRON won t even wear PRON yeah PRON wouldn t put on PRON medal PRON wouldn t wear PRON metal PRON get a call from general odierno yeah say beau this be an order captain put on PRON medal first time PRON ever put PRON on wow when PRON win the bronze PRON say dad don t tell anybody yeah don t tell people about this okay when PRON win the bronze medal PRON say don t tell anybody no PRON didn t tell PRON till PRON get home oh so but and when PRON go into service PRON say i don t want to use the name biden PRON know how PRON all have yeah i ve be in and out of iraq and afghanistan time so i get to see PRON when PRON be there on three different occasion and at first PRON would not wear PRON know PRON have PRON name right PRON get permission to have another name i think PRON use hunter PRON mother maiden name PRON know but PRON wouldn t use biden because PRON do not want to be treat any differently so how do PRON tell PRON well that be PRON stage four how do PRON hear well i be with PRON PRON be first diagnose with have have a stroke PRON come out of the military PRON be deem the fit guy in PRON battalion PRON do these test PRON have i think PRON be body fat i mean PRON be a runner and one day when PRON be run PRON start to kind of hallucinate mm and PRON worry PRON PRON didn t want to tell anybody and finally PRON tell PRON brother who be PRON lifeline hunter about PRON and PRON eventually tell PRON and then one day i m go down to washington after be home on the weekend and PRON secret service agent come in and PRON say mr vice president mr vice president the general be down the general be down refer to PRON son the attorney general PRON say he be down he be down i come run out i say what do PRON mean PRON say an ambulance be come for PRON at PRON home he be down i don t know what and so i get to PRON house be only a mile and a half away i ride in with PRON and PRON be paralyzed and PRON lose PRON ability to speak and PRON keep go ah ah what the hell be go on and PRON diagnose and PRON do the mri PRON show where the clot be in the brain and PRON be diagnose initially as a stroke that resolve PRON it be a long story don t want to bore PRON with PRON but next thing well PRON turn out PRON be the beginning of the growth of this cancer mm and so when PRON keep get bad PRON go down to md anderson in august and PRON diagnose PRON with stage four glioblastoma and hunter and ashley and jill and i and PRON all make a deal PRON would not talk about the percentage because PRON just have hope without hope PRON can t live and so that be how i begin to get knowledge about cancer i try to learn everything i possibly could about the disease and what beau would do be i would see PRON and he d say dad he d say dad look at PRON stop look sad don t look sad dad no matter what happen i m go to be all right dad you ve get to look happy you ve get to look strong for the family dad the family need PRON to look strong dad and i m not exaggerate i mean it like PRON be a remarkable young man i m not suggest other people i m just speak about PRON though PRON be always about everybody else with beau PRON know PRON dad have an expression when grow up PRON would teach PRON say joey never explain and never complain i can say give PRON word as a biden i never one single time from the moment PRON be bear ever hear beau biden complain mm not one single time PRON be a lot easy for the press to cover whether or not PRON grope a woman or whether PRON send an e mail than PRON be to determine how PRON pay for free college education PRON have no regret in the deep quiet pure moment about not actually run it be be a year since the opening of the smithsonian national museum of african american history culture now a record break number of people have visit to understand and reflect on PRON journey oprah joe biden be bear in scranton pennsylvania PRON be raise by PRON mother catherine and PRON father joseph sr who clean furnace and later sell used car the family later move to mayfield delaware where joe jr washed windows and weed garden to help pay tuition for the prestigious archmere academy a private school joe say be PRON deep desire to attend PRON would go on to the university of delaware and later law school at syracuse in joe biden be elect u s senator for the state of delaware PRON know what i be strike by i read that ever since PRON be a little boy PRON be a boy with a vision that PRON have a picture in PRON head of the kind of man that PRON want to be do PRON live up to PRON own expectation do PRON fulfill the vision or exceed the vision i by and large believe that i have end up be the man i want to be but PRON wasn t in term of accomplishment mm PRON be because people usually translate that in a PRON know as a young guy i know i want to be senator i know i want to be president i know that wasn t true what be true be i want to live up to PRON parents expectation mm and i want to be that person that meet PRON mother standard be define by PRON courage i want to be that person who be no matter what happen just get back up and keep go i want to be that person who be there and loyal to people who be loyal to PRON i want to be there i want to be that guy who know what be worth lose over do PRON know as a little boy when PRON have the vision as a little boy when PRON have this picture in PRON head what be the picture the picture PRON vary as i get old what PRON come down to be i realize everything in PRON family and in PRON faith be about the abuse of power that PRON have an obligation to challenge the abuse of power whether PRON be start off as a kid in the civil right movement and sit in and be the only white employee in the east side of the city or whether PRON be PRON know challenge the same thing when i run for election that i know be not popular but i believe and mm hmm because i believe people ultimately reward PRON for authenticity don t PRON think too this be interesting when i think about PRON because everybody know that you re get on the train every night and go home and PRON know swear into office actually in the hospital when PRON boy be there and so PRON be a dedicated father go back and forth from delaware to d c don t PRON think that actually be on that train every day be a good thing that ever happen to PRON ground mechanism absolutely because i remember live in baltimore take the train to new york or go to d c there be something about look out the window which i actually love even now drive in a car and see peoples home absolutely yeah and think about absolutely i wonder what they re eat tonight what be PRON talk about at that kitchen table what be PRON talk about at the kitchen table PRON look out on that stretch between baltimore and aberdeen yeah yeah and then see all those light on and PRON wonder what be PRON talk about for example by the way the reason i go home be i need PRON kid more than PRON need PRON i mean i really do but PRON know as a parent PRON know a child can only hold an important thought for about hour if PRON miss PRON PRON miss PRON so even though i wasn t ozzie and harriet PRON have breakfast and dinner make i d go home and lie in bed with PRON and they d talk and get up and so but the thing that be the good would happen you d be in washington and there d be a vote and you d cross constitution and the cop would stop the traffic and after a while you d be get to think well what take PRON so long PRON know but you d get on the train and you d go home and the shoe shine guy who be a good friend of mine would say joe what the hell be PRON do down there man come here yeah i mean not a joke not a joke if PRON notice if PRON ever be to delaware from the time i run i ve be refer to as joe that be all PRON don t call PRON senator even today the secret service look when PRON go hey joe come here PRON know these be constituent and they re kind of like oh what be go on here but PRON really do ground PRON man because PRON know PRON even after become vice president oh absolutely so PRON really keep PRON from ever get to the point where PRON feel self important yeah i know this sound like hyperbole but PRON really be true PRON be a gift if PRON keep PRON so connected to the people and where the people be and everybody now know how badly the medium get PRON wrong PRON must have have some inkling PRON must ve have PRON must ve not have be shock then on election night oprah if PRON be actually on the train talk to people with the people i didn t drive as vice president i take the train on the weekend i didn t go every day but i do event and a month out i come back and say we re go to lose this election a month out a month out mm and the reason i do PRON know i know i m call middle class joe in washington that be not mean as a compliment PRON mean you re not sophisticated PRON know but what be happen be the reason i believe PRON be go to lose and i think hillary would ve be a great president i really do i think PRON would ve be a great president but there two study that just come out one be annenberg school i forget the other one i apologize now but PRON look at all the word utter in a campaign how many of those word relate to an issue few word be utter related to any specific issue this last campaign than any campaign in the last presidential race now PRON be an incredibly well inform person i ll bet PRON can t find friend who can tell PRON what hillary position be on child care not generically specifically right how we re go to have free college education how it be go to be pay for all the thing that matter to those people and by the way PRON wouldn t be have this discussion but for vote let PRON put that in perspective too okay mm hmm mm hmm but in the state PRON have PRON go in i spend all PRON time in pennsylvania ohio minnesota michigan wisconsin florida virginia they re the place and this be not a criticism but i think what happen be PRON get to the point where PRON become identity politic mm hmm and PRON learn the wrong lesson from barack brilliant campaign PRON run and for example the end of the campaign i go up to a union hall to make a point and i say PRON know one of the reason hillary have to win there like union guy so one of the reason hillary have to win important because PRON need equal pay for woman place go nuts PRON know why all PRON wife be the political type PRON don t like the fact PRON wife isn t be pay where the wife who aren t be pay fairly be in corporation and law firm in silicon valley but these guys wife be high school educate kid and they re not get pay and i say and secondly look it none of PRON business who the hell PRON marry man let well enough alone period cheer they re cheering i m not joke now the press say only biden could do that that be not true PRON get to state what you re for and if PRON get suckere into not have the time in fairness to the press it be a lot easy for the press to cover whether or not PRON grope a woman or whether PRON send an e mail than PRON be to determine how PRON pay for free college education than PRON be to go in and look at what PRON position be on real tax equity i mean it just easy it easy and it be almost like PRON can t not cover PRON PRON can t not cover PRON and so if PRON look at all the coverage there be hardly any coverage about the thing that matter to the life of ordinary people do PRON feel that PRON could ve beat hillary how can PRON help PRON as a nation bring dignity back to PRON conversation PRON have no regret in the deep quiet pure moment about not actually run i have a regret that i be not president because i think there be so much opportunity mm i think america be so incredibly well position but i don t regret the decision i make because PRON be the right decision for PRON family oprah no woman or man should announce they re run for president unless PRON can answer two question yeah one do PRON truly believe they re the most qualified person for that moment i believe i be but be i prepare to be able to give PRON whole heart PRON whole soul and all PRON attention to the endeavor and i know i wasn t be PRON still broken PRON family be break i be break and i find PRON even like PRON know this be why i know there be sexism in the campaign i would be speak somewhere and someone would yell beau biden and i d say beau and i d find PRON break down and people would say wasn t PRON a good father if hillary break down PRON would ve say she play the woman card mm hmm mm hmm so PRON be so i just know i just do PRON feel PRON that could ve beat hillary i yes but PRON would ve be an incredibly difficult race and i have nothing but friendship for hillary do PRON not want to take that on because when everyone be get excited about the possibility of PRON join the race there be also obviously a lot of speculation that PRON wouldn t want to get in and take on yes the clinton factor well here be what the speculation be you re right about that mm hmm the other speculation be biden wouldn t want to be the guy deny a woman the opportunity yeah yeah PRON be real simple PRON son be die mm i couldn t tell anybody the only person i could confide in be barack he be the only one who have to know so what i wasn t able to do hillary as i say be a friend when PRON be secretary of state PRON have breakfast once a week at PRON home so PRON call PRON and PRON want i m sure PRON doesn t mind PRON say this PRON call PRON PRON want to come down and talk about the race PRON want to know whether i be go to run whether PRON be go to run or not and i sit down and i say hillary look it much less likely that i run than not run but if i do it ll be straight up it be not about PRON it be about PRON but PRON have some hope because i be tell that PRON decide to try some experimental procedure on deal with glioblastoma PRON inject PRON with a thing call anti pd and PRON inject a virus into PRON brain and there be this one faint possibility so PRON give PRON hope for how long well PRON never give up hope but PRON be PRON think in january i think in january or february there be a chance maybe PRON beat the odd mm but what i couldn t do because PRON would ve kill PRON if i announce i wasn t run because of PRON son because PRON want PRON to run yeah when do PRON tell PRON to run because that become i think PRON be go to run just because of beau wish that PRON would run every thanksgiving for year since i meet jill PRON would go to nantucket for thanksgiving when PRON be little boy mm hmm so PRON wouldn t offend PRON parent PRON parent and or PRON deceased wife parent PRON be all go this be a nuclear holiday now of PRON trudge up and so PRON be in nantucket and PRON do the christmas lighting beau be sick and PRON say dad PRON get to talk and PRON go back to the house PRON be stay in and then sit down and say PRON don t understand dad PRON want PRON to run this be hunt and beau and hunt argue this will keep the family together PRON will give PRON purpose but i just didn t have the courage to do PRON i just didn t think i could say to the public that PRON know this be i m not go to divert when PRON little grandson say pop PRON smell like daddy can i lie down with PRON mm PRON know by the way a lot of people have that but as i m president i know i couldn t now PRON didn t make any demand the whole family get together even after beau pass and say you ve get to run joe jill want PRON to run but i just in the end the decision be no because what PRON didn t have the eye of the tiger because i didn t have the eye of the tiger i know that i be still so um i know i be miss PRON so that i didn t think i could do the job that i would have to do but that be not say do i regret not be president yeah i do but i make the right decision for PRON family i believe at that time and i think that PRON have a really incredibly qualified candidate to be president so i didn t feel like i be leave the field and because i leave the field that there wasn t anybody who could PRON know run the country i didn t feel that way have there be a thought or consideration for over million people have make the trip to washington d c to experience the plight and triumph display within the smithsonian national museum of african american history culture PRON honor and celebrate this year old national treasure folk each of PRON have a responsibility PRON all know PRON you ve be teach PRON here PRON be teach PRON before PRON come here to treat people with dignity PRON demand PRON for yourself PRON demand that PRON be treat that way and all of PRON all of PRON have to do better when PRON come to build the bond of empathy that folk who aren t like PRON aren t like PRON can know PRON understand PRON life can t be live in this self referential self reinforce self righteous echo chamber PRON build for PRON online live in PRON screen encourage shallow and antiseptic relationship that make PRON easy to reduce other to stereotype how can PRON help PRON as a nation bring dignity back to PRON conversation i hear PRON speak about this by act with dignity yeah by not get down into the mosh pit right so from a big point of view social spiritual point of view where PRON be as a nation as a culture of people how bad be PRON do PRON think i don t think it let PRON tell PRON what i think the underlying cause of angst be PRON go beyond politic we re go through such a gigantic transition the consequence of digitalization supercompute capability artificial intelligence the ability to do thing that have to be do by an individual no longer have to be do can be do by a machine be scare the live hell out of people PRON dad use to have an expression joey a job be about a lot more than a paycheck it be about PRON dignity PRON respect PRON place in the community be able to look PRON kid in the eye and say it be go to be okay that be what a job be about and so now PRON have get ten of thousand of people million of people black and white look out there and hear the debate go on about globalization and the question be how do PRON adjust that globalization to meet peoples need so have there be a thought or consideration for no not yet no and i say that not yet because look i m a great respecter of fate i don t plan on run but i tell PRON what i plan on go and here be PRON problem PRON know i learn how to become one of the most popular elect official in the united states i m actually not run for president it be amazing boom thing go PRON know PRON really get good but i m ask to speak a lot in political fora and i m do PRON not as nearly as often as i m ask because every time i m ask PRON say PRON translate PRON as i m run for president but i m go to do everything i can to change the dynamic here because i think PRON can win back the house and i think PRON have a shot at the senate and PRON know the other expression PRON dad use be look don t compare PRON to the almighty compare PRON to the alternative well right now i look awful good but i can go out and do that raise money and do those thing but i m not sit here now i m as i say a great respecter of fate i m over i m thank god right now in awful good health PRON know but i don t know what the hell what thing be go to be year from now i just don t know so i promise PRON i m not do anything to organize run but i m go to go out there and continue to do what i ve do since i ve be year old mm hmm holler what be PRON do PRON think that it be about power that change people and how have PRON manage the power you ve hold what happen in that moment when PRON can literally see the spirit go someplace what be PRON do PRON think that it be about power that change people and how have PRON manage the power you ve hold well i haven t hold that much power PRON power the reason i m view as have that power be all there no power in the vice presidency it be all reflective and PRON come from the president but i think the people abuse power be that PRON in fact be seduce by the notion that PRON be so self important that PRON really matter when in fact PRON be not usually the case the only way the leader i ve observe who be the good be the one who have courage to take a chance be willing to lose on principle and two be self aware PRON understand PRON strength and PRON understand PRON weakness PRON play to PRON strength and PRON try to shore up PRON weakness and the people who don t do that be the people who be not self aware enough to know what PRON because most of the time that abuse end up be PRON downfall as well PRON see so much on the news every day rage and anger on both side what do PRON think be the source of all this rage and furor well i think it be because PRON think the system have fail PRON i think PRON look out at the congress and for the last since barack get elect the first thing republicans do be say how can PRON keep PRON from succeed at all yeah and so the congress have be sit down when PRON think of i think at when i be in the congress PRON be more divided but PRON actually know there have to be work together to get consensus to get thing do i also think PRON look out at the political system and PRON think that PRON be powerless they re powerless because PRON don t possess money and power to influence vote influence outcome what be PRON most proud of joe i m most proud of at least to this point of have serve as long as i do and democrats and republicans still accept PRON word and treat PRON as if i m honorable i be proud of be able to say that i never vote for anything that i disagree with mm when i be agnostic about PRON i d look at whatever PRON constituent want i would vote for PRON but i never vote for anything that i feel be wrong now that you ve have time to write a book and reflect on PRON life and decision do PRON think differently about that moment when president obama be give PRON the medal of freedom what strike PRON about that moment be PRON keep say i don t deserve this and i be think of course PRON deserve PRON do PRON think well PRON know differently now that i still don t think PRON don t look i think i m a i hope i m a decent man i hope i ve do some good but to single PRON out as one of PRON think or PRON know well i think i know i ve do some good laugh all right but PRON know i think that i think there other people a bit more deserving than PRON really i really do yeah what be PRON definition of freedom as PRON pertain to PRON own life continue to be able to say what i believe without fear of anything other than significant disagreement know that i still live in a country where i can say or do whatever i believe and PRON will be protect what be the one thing people want to hear at the end of PRON life what happen in that moment when PRON can literally see the spirit go someplace oprah celebrate the year anniversary of the opening of the smithsonian national museum of african american history culture hundred of year on the journey and now million have make a pilgrimage to experience PRON collective story what be the one thing people want to hear at the end of PRON life as PRON irish say you re a good man or you re a good woman mm PRON want to know that at the end of PRON life that PRON be worthwhile that people who love PRON that be why but anyway that why go ahead that be why it be so important to tell PRON mother or father who dying if PRON have a chance to be with PRON that be why it be so important to be with PRON and tell PRON tell PRON all about how much PRON love PRON tell PRON how much PRON do for PRON talk to PRON and that one of the great thing i get to do with PRON mother and father and PRON son beau i mean i be there hold PRON hand i mean PRON know PRON be what be that last moment PRON look at PRON and PRON say dad i m not afraid i m okay i always wear this rosary and PRON have PRON on at that time and PRON be at the very end and PRON brother be sit there and the three of PRON be hold hand and PRON want to reassure PRON but PRON get a chance to tell PRON PRON get a chance to tell PRON mom PRON get a chance to tell PRON dad be that a sacred holy moment be that what what happen in that moment when PRON can literally see the spirit go someplace

incredibly important leadership of our governor we're stuck because we have a president who just thinks he can magically wish it away or bully it neither of which he can do the reality is that we want our children to be back in school safely we want our small businesses to be open safely and you know what we want our families to be able to survive during this pandemic and have a roof over their head be able to pay the bills and food on the table and have the health care they need that's what we should be doing in america that's what should be the first priority right now and you know what i don't know about you but we just want our lives back right i know joe biden i know kamala harris i've worked with both of them for a long time they can do that for us it's not easy it's a lot of hard

a good purpose we've had enough we have had enough let's make it clear we have had enough as a country as a state and the good news is we don't have to be stuck in this chaos we're a democracy we vote we make the difference and all we have to do is vote and we're going to take back our country let's go do it ladies and gentlemen please welcome senator gary peters forgive us [Music] well hello flint are we ready to go out and win an election are we bringing all of our friends to the polls and are we ready not just to win but are we ready to win big well i can feel it and i'll tell you i'm just so excited to be here and i'm excited because we have president barack obama ready to come out to greet us we also have the next president of the united states joe biden ready to come out and greet us and they're both here because they love michigan and they certainly love the city of flint and we know that they love this state because they have been here time and time again but they don't just show up to visit and wave their hands and do some politic and when they show up they get the business done they have done that before and they will do it again they have shown stable leadership thoughtful leadership focused leadership man do we need that again or what i just want to talk again about where we saw them together and how it made a difference we heard dan kildy talk about it but it's personal to me when we were facing the financial crisis when when wall street agreed went wild it almost brought down the entire economy it was a mess that barack obama and joe biden walked into a mess created by the republican administration that was there before they came to our city they came to our state and we know that the auto industry was hanging in the balance with all of those jobs all that history the state that put the entire country on wheels and built the middle class all of that was in danger i remember i was a new member of congress in 2008 and i represented a district that included chrysler many of you probably know the chrysler headquarters there at ann arbor and i will never i will never forget the meeting that i had with the ceo and a number of his team when i went there and they were in big trouble and the question was whether or not there would be any assistance for the auto companies and general motors and chrysler and i remember that discussion with that ceo when he said he goes congressman let me be really clear to you the economy is in shambles money's not available and i am literally four five maybe six weeks away from liquidating chrysler not reorganizing chrysler liquidated chrysler just closing everything down and i looked around that room in the faces of the people i don't think they had heard that from the ceo that this company was going to go and disappear and i had visions of that giant parking lot at the auburn hills facility with grass growing in and no cars there families in difficult shape not just for the autos but all of the other businesses and i went back and worked with colleagues and talked to president obama and joe biden and said you've got to you've got to help we've got to do it we've got to include chrysler in it and i'll just say it to this day and i'm going to say it over and over again when people were were betting against michigan workers when donald trump said hey let detroit go bankrupt he said that when vice president pence was a member of congress and voted against the auto rescue i will just say thank god barack obama and joe biden stood with us they stood with american workers they stood with workers here in michigan they stood with workers in flint and in detroit they were there for us when we needed them and we are going to be there for them now because we need them back we are in the middle of a pandemic that has lasted a whole lot longer than any of us would like we still looking for leadership we have a president that has not acknowledged it and thought it would disappear and didn't act quickly and pitch states against each other did not show the kind of leadership that we have seen in the past but thank god joe biden has a plan thank god he will be our next president and thank god we will be able to work with him and his leadership to get through this challenge but i will say that joe biden you know he he can't do it alone he needs help he needs friends and he needs friends in the united states senate he needs a democratic majority in the united states senate we know if mitch mcconnell stays as the republican leader he will stand in the way of the progress that we need in this country we saw him do it when barack obama was president we cannot allow him to stay which is why we must win it's why we must win here in michigan i've got really good news for you we have a real shot a real shot to take the majority in the united states senate but one thing we must do is we must win here we must hold this seat and we will hold this seat as a democratic seat from michigan in the united states senate now the republicans know that they're poor pouring money into my race if any of you seen any tv commercials there are a lot of tv commercials they're pouring money in with negative nasty false ads the fact checkers say they're either faults to monster will be false or smears that's the way the republicans are trying to win mitch mcconnell and his billionaire buddies put in 20 million dollars the last three weeks and now just this weekend they're going to spend 8 million these are billionaires that think they can buy this election we all know we are all proud michiganders and we know that billionaires cannot buy an election in michigan we know that billionaires have a lot of money we get that but one of the many reasons this country is so great a billionaire still gets one vote we get one vote and we have more votes here today in flint than those billionaires but we have to work it's not over let me just wrap up by bringing a bad memory and then painting a picture of where we were going to be we all remember what happened in 2016. we all remember waking up that morning and seeing the results and i know everyone here today had this thought was there something more that i could have done the loss was only two votes of precinct is there something else i could have done could i made a few more calls could i talk to my neighbor and get those two votes out could i have had a couple friends and make sure that they get to the ballot well folks i got good news for you when you leave here today you still have time to do that work when you wake up tomorrow you can put in those two extra hours of work you can talk to those two nor neighbors you can take someone to the polls a friend of yours and when we do that over the next few days this will be the vision and i want to leave you with this vision before we hear so from some amazing people when we are waiting for the results from this election you're going to be looking at the tv the whole country is going to be watching because michigan is the center of that and when those worlds come in maybe wednesday depending on the absentees when that comes across your tv screen i know what each and every one of you will do you will jump out of your seat you will cheer because you'll say thank god michigan is a blue state thank god we have a democratic president of the united states thank god we re-elected gary peters to the senate and now have told mitch mcconnell you're in the minority we have a democratic majority in the senate and the house and collectively we will say no to the politics of division and hate that we have seen these last four years and say hello to democratic progress let's go on to victory 10 hail marys i meditate for practice channel 9 news tell me

afternoon everyone good afternoon thanks for having me and for joining today's car rally my name is dondre young and i was born and raised here in the great city of flint michigan and have been active in the community my entire life organizing and engaging people to fight for environmental justice in the fight for clean affordable water and sustainable infrastructure i grew up union strong with my family members working at these general motors and being proud members of the uaw my mother was a union representative and liaison for flint community schools my family and my community motivates me to stay committed to the fight for equity which starts at the grassroots level i always tell people that fighting for change at the grassroots level is more than just your typical nine-to-five job it's your whole life right now we desperately need a president who recognizes that this pandemic has shined a bright light on the inequities that define our system this president has used his words in this nation's highest office to stoke the flames of hate and division i don't need to tell all of you that enough is simply enough this just simply isn't going to work for us ladies and gentlemen we are just three days away from a day we will never forget this is no doubt the most important election of our lives and when november 4th rolls around we need to know that we left it all on the table that we did everything we could to elect the leaders we know we deserve we're at a cross crossroads right now and meeting this moment means exercising your right to vote it means telling your friends and family to vote for those of you who have yet to vote you can go to iowavote.com again that is iwillvote.com to make your plan today if you care about health care and the water you drink you need to vote for joe biden the stakes are too high to sit this one out joe biden knows that change starts at the grassroots level he knows that the best laws and policies demand a patient attentive ear to the ground he will listen he cares about us he helped save the auto industry which made a huge difference for thousands in flint and he will be more than a nine-to-five president because he knows that's what it takes to right the ship here in flint we are no strangers to what it takes or rather what it means to suffer a public health crisis as our country and the world feels the weight of the covent 19 pandemic we're all looking for hope and leadership to move us forward i remember a time where we sought that same unique brand of hope when we were going in the wrong direction we used our power made history and elected the first black president of the united states i'm so honored to introduce a man and president who embodies that hope who forged a bright path forward but one little housekeeping item before i welcome him to the stage we're asking that you please refrain from hunking your horns during president obama and vice president biden's remarks flint please join me in

a plan to vote because we need everybody not just some people we got we got to get everybody out there i love you too okay that's it put that mask back on listen michigan joel biden is my brother i love this i love joe biden and he will be a great president now i'll admit 12 years ago when i when i asked him to be the nominee for vice president with me when i was running i i didn't know joe that well we had served together in the senate but he and i came from different places part of different generations but i quickly came to admire joe as a man who learned early on to treat everybody he meets with dignity and with respect living by the words his mom taught him no one's better than you joe but you're no better than anybody else and and that sense of of decency and empathy the belief in in hard work and family and faith the belief that everybody counts that's who joe is and that's who he'll be as president i i can tell you the presidency doesn't change who you are it shows who you are it reveals who you are and for eight years joe was the last one in the room whenever i faced a big decision and he made me a better president he's got the character and the experience to make us a better country and he and kamala are going to be in the fight not for themselves but for every single one of us and we sure can't say that about the president we've got right now you know i i i i've said this before i never thought donald trump would embrace my vision i i understood he didn't agree with my policies but i did hope for the country's sake that he might show some interest in the job he might take the job seriously he never has he hasn't shown any interest in doing the work or helping anybody but himself and his friends or treating the presidency as anything more than a reality show to give him the attention that he craves but unfortunately the rest of us have to live with the consequences almost two hundred and thirty thousand americans are dead more than a hundred thousand small businesses have closed almost three hundred three hundred 000 jobs are gone in michigan alone america just had its single worst week of new covet cases and what's his closing argument here we are the worst week this week i mean we've been going through this now for months the federal government has had an opportunity to respond four months and his closing argument this week is that the press and people are too focused on covid cohen kovetkoviti's complaining he's he's jealous of kovitz media coverage and now he's accusing doctors of profiting off this pandemic think about that he said this just yesterday said doctors are overblowing it because they're going to make money off it doctors he cannot fathom he does not understand the notion that somebody would risk their life to save others without trying to make a buck his chief of staff says we're not going to control the pandemic that's a quote said it last week we are not going to control the pandemic we noticed mr chief of staff we understand you're not going to control the pandemic but you know who will joe biden will when we elect him president of the united states you remember when republicans were saying let detroit go bankrupt you remember that now they might as well be saying let america get coveted because that's how they're asking if trump were focused on kovit from the beginning cases wouldn't be reaching new record highs across the country some of the places he owes rallies have even seen new spikes after he leaves town there was just a study by stanford university that just came out showing thousands of people are likely to have gotten sick because of these rallies he's holding what is his obsession by the way with crowd size you notice that he he's always work this is the one measure he has of success he's still worrying about his inauguration crowd being smaller than mine it really bugs him he talked about he's still talking about that does he have nothing better to worry about did no one come to his birthday party when he was a kid was he traumatized what what what's with crowds well you know i've i've had crowds before you know have you had quite a few but but you know when a country's going through a pandemic that's not what you're supposed to be worrying about and that's the difference between joe biden and trump right there trump cares about feeding his ego joe cares about keeping you and your family safe and he's less interested in feeding his ego with having big crowds then he is making sure he's not going around making more and more people sick that's what you should expect from a president you can expect something different from a reality tv star but from a president you want them to put you above their own ego look here's the truth michigan this pandemic would have been challenging for any president but this idea that somehow this white house has done anything but completely screw this up is nonsense canada identified its first case the same week that the u.s did right just a few miles up right it's not close i may not be pointing north but canada is pretty close by our mortality rate in the united states is two and a half times higher than canada think about that if we had the same percentage of folks dying in canada as we do here nearly 90 000 americans would have died instead of 230 000 americans if we had handled this pandemic like canada did a hundred and forty thousand of our fellow americans might still be alive today think about that think about that and yet despite that last week when trump was asked if he'd do anything different he said not much really not much can't think of anything i listen i i understand the president was was anxious to downplay because he wanted to get credit for the economy that he inherited and zero blame for the pandemic he ignored but it doesn't work that way the job doesn't work that way tweeting at the tv doesn't fix things making stuff up doesn't make people's lives better you've got to have a plan you've got to put in the work and along with the experience to get things done joe biden has concrete plans and policies that will turn our vision of a better fairer stronger country into reality joe's not going to screw up testing joe's not going to call scientists idiots he's not going to host super spreader events around the country what joe will do is get this pandemic under control with a plan to make testing free and widely available to get a vaccine every american costs free and make sure our front line heroes never have to ask other countries for the equipment that they need that's what joe biden will do joe's plan will guarantee paid sick leave for workers and parents affected by the pandemic he'll make sure that small businesses in every community not just some not just big corporations but small businesses that hold our communities together and employ millions of americans can reopen safely donald trump likes to claim he built this economy america created 1.5 million more jobs in the last three years of the obama biden administration than in his first three years and that was before he could blame the pandemic joe biden and i with the help of a democratic congress rescued the auto industry gary peters was there he told us to bet on michigan and we did and manufacturing in michigan grew by 15 percent over our last four years trump promised he'd make michigan the manufacturing hub of the world again it's up one percent under his first four years 15 under obama biden one percent under him that's michigan right here we handed him the longest streak of job growth in american history but the economic damage he inflicted by botching the pandemic response means he'll be the only president since herbert hoover to actually lose jobs herbert hoover that's a long time ago joe biden and gary peters know that the key to a strong economy isn't cutting more taxes for billionaires it's lifting up the prospects for working americans and joe's got a plan to create one million new auto related jobs by accelerating electric vehicle production he's got a plan to create 10 million good clean energy jobs and fight climate change and secure environmental justice something that's relevant to flint michigan you know something about that he'll and he'll pay for his plans by rolling back trump's tax cuts for billionaires and and this is important joe sees this moment not to get back to where we were but to build on the progress we made together and finally make long overdue changes so that our economy actually makes life a little easier for everybody for the waitress trying to raise a kid on her own for the student figuring out how to pay for next semester's classes or the shift worker always on the edge of getting laid off or the cancer survivor who's worried that her pre-existing conditions protections will be taken away let's talk about health care for a second let's talk about health care for a second republicans love to say right before an election that they'll protect your pre-existing conditions that's what they say well you know what joe and i actually protected them 10 years ago with the affordable care act and since we did so with no help from republicans no votes from republicans republicans have tried to repeal or undermine the aca more than 60 times for 60 times they've tried to take people's health care away and and when asked why are you why are you doing that why are you being so mean you don't think these people should have health care that say no no no we've got a new plan it's going to be beautiful it's going to be terrific except it's been 10 years now and they still don't have a plan they're trying to bamboozle you instead of actually coming up with a plan they've attacked the aca at every turn they've they've driven up costs they've driven up the number of uninsured now they're trying to get the supreme court to take your health care away in the middle of a pandemic in the mid right at the time when people need health care they they they've signed on to a case right now in the supreme court where they're trying to take insurance away from folks who need it with nothing but empty promises to take its place and now mitch mcconnell is pouring millions of outside super pac dollars into michigan to try to beat gary peters because that's part of their agenda michigan here is the truth joel and kamala and gary will protect your health care they will expand medicare they will make insurance more affordable for everybody and the reason you know that's true is because they were there when we did it the first time and here's another thing with joe and kamal at the helm this is a big benefit michelle and i were talking about this over dinner the other day you're not gonna have to think about them every day you're not gonna have to argue with your family about them every day it won't be so exhausting you'll be able to get on with your lives knowing that the president is not going to suggest we inject bleach as a possible cure of covet you won't have to find out you won't you you won't wake up in the morning and kind of open your phone oh newsflash uh the president retweeted conspiracy theories that the navy seals didn't actually kill bin laden you're not gonna have a president who goes out of his way to insult people just because they don't support him this is not normal behavior people we would not tolerate it from a teacher or a coach or a co-worker or a family member if if a neighbor was acting like this you'd stay away from that neighbor why would we accept it from the president of the united states and you know what there are consequences to this action there are consequences to his actions it's not just a joke it's not funny those actions embolden other people to be mean and divisive and racist and a phrase is the fabric of all of our lives and it affects how our children see the world and how they treat each other it affects the way our families get along it affects the way the world sees america that's why joe talks about the soul of america that's why he he talks about decency and and kindness and responsibility and hard work that more than anything is what separates joe biden from his opponent he actually cares about every american he does not have a mean-spirited bone in his body i have seen him spend spend time with with people that strangers that he doesn't know when he hears about they're going through a hardship he talks about what he's gone through when he sees a kid his eyes light up because because he thinks about his own kids and grandkids he joe biden tries to live the values we cherish honesty hard work kindness humility responsibility helping somebody else out that used to be the definition of of manliness not strutting and showing off acting important bullying people used to be being a man meant taking care of your other people not going around bragging but but just doing the work not looking for credit trying to live right passing on those values to your kids looking out for a community carrying your weight giving up a little bit of what what you might have to help somebody who has a real need when you elect joe that's what you'll see reflected from the white house and those shouldn't be republican or democratic values they didn't used to be they're what we grew up learning from our parents and from our grandparents and they're the values we still try to teach our kids and they're not white or black or hispanic or asian or native american values they're american values and we've got to reclaim them right now but to reclaim them we're gonna have to turn out like never before if we're going to reclaim those values we need to leave no doubt we can't afford to be complacent not this time not in this election we got a little complacent the last election and listen i understand why americans get frustrated and sometimes think dumb government's not going to make a difference voting is not going to make a difference i understand that government's not perfect the people in government are not perfect even when it's working government's not going to solve every problem but we can make things better a president can't by himself solve every challenge facing the economy here in flint or michigan but if we elect people like gary peters and dan kildy and we get a house and a senate joined with a white house that are more focused on working people and getting you the help that you need they will make a difference and some folks will get jobs that wouldn't otherwise have jobs and some folks will have health care that wouldn't otherwise have health care a president by himself can't eliminate all racial bias in our criminal justice system but if we elect district attorneys and states attorneys and sheriffs focused on equality and justice and we once again have a justice department and a civil rights division in the justice department that cares about these issues we can make things better and that's what voting's about not making things perfect but making things better it puts us on a track so that generations from now we can look back and say you know what right about then things start getting better again the fact that you don't get 100 of what you want right away that's not a good reason to vote you just got to keep at it you know typically just over 50 of us vote who are eligible think about that almost half of the people in most elections who are eligible to vote don't vote imagine if 60 of us voted imagine if 70 of us voted imagine january 20th when we swear in a president and vice president who's got a plan to get us out of this mess who care about folks like you who've been in your shoes who know what it's like to struggle who know what it's like to have to work hard who are thinking about working americans and have a plan to help you start getting ahead imagine what it's going to be like to have a president and a vice president who believe in science and who have a plan to protect this planet for our children and who believe in racial equality and are sending a clear signal that we're all in this together and are doing the work to bring us closer so that we have an america where no matter what we look like where we come from who we love or how much money we've got we we can make it and we have a place and we're treated with dignity and respect michigan that's what's possible and i'm asking you to remember that it's possible i want you to remember what this country can be but you can't just imagine a better future you can't just wish for it you've got to fight for it you got to fight for it we got to out hustle the other side we got to vote up and down the ticket like never before right here in michigan and all across the country we've got to leave no doubt about who we are and what this country stands for and if we do we will send gary peters back to the senate and we will elect a man who loves this country and who cares about you and who will fight for every single one of us and will look out not just for folks who support him but even the folks who don't my friend the next president

stabenow my good buddy gary peters who you are going to send back to the united states senate because i'm going to need him we can always count on him to be your senator for you and your family and my good friend congressman dan kildee who we need to send back the house dan's a good man a good man and of course i wish we could figure out how to send back a guy who uh we used to have an expression in the up in scranton we'd say when someone wasn't somebody else's equals they wasn't a patch on his jeans i tell you what mr president you're still driving him crazy because he knows he wasn't a patch on your jeans i tell you what barack obama it's great to be with the president again it reminds me of what we can be when you have a president of character a president respected around the world a president our kids looked up to and did look up to i want to say something we don't say often enough and i mean this from the bottom of my heart barack obama was a great president of the united states of america and i want to make sure we say it here today mr president thank you thank you thank you went through eight years without one single trace of scandal not one single trace of scandal it's gonna be nice to return to that flint three days three days we can put an end to this presidency we have now that has divided the nation three days we can put an end to a presidency that has failed to protect this nation three days we can put an end to this presidency that has fanned the flames of hate all across this nation and made us a laughing stock around the world millions of americans have already voted millions more are voting today tomorrow and god willing all the way through to the close of the polls on tuesday and my message is simple the power to change the country is not figuratively it's literally in your hands i don't care how hard donald trump tries there's nothing let me say it again there's nothing that he can do to stop the people of this nation from voting in overwhelming numbers and taking back this democracy and when americans vote no matter how many threats he makes america will be heard when america's heard i believe the message is going to be loud and it's going to be clear it's time for donald trump to pack his bags and go home we're done with the chaos the tweets the anger the hate the failure the refusal to take any responsibility we've got a lot of work to do we've got a lot of work to do and if i'm elected your president we're going to do it we're going to act and we're going to need your help in doing it as well we're going to act to get covert under control on day one of my presidency i'll put an action a plan i've been taking about talking about for months already laid out a national mandate mask wearing social distancing testing tracing all things as president obama just said it should have been could have been put in place months and months ago a plan for full and fair and free i might add distribution of therapeutics and vaccines when we get one imagine where we'd be if we had a president of war mask instead of mocking it i can tell you this we wouldn't have nine million confirmed cases of covet in this nation over 230 000 deaths we wouldn't be seeing a new record of cases we're seeing right now ninety thousand cases today yesterday ninety thousand new cases we wouldn't be faith by the way five hundred thousand it's just the past week this guy tells us it's going away i don't think he'll make it go away if he goes away folks we wouldn't be facing another 200 000 deaths in the next few months this president knew in january the virus was deadly and trying to improve his image he wanted have tried to talk to bob woodr he thought he could change his mind but what he did he let it be known all the way back in january he knew how dangerous this pandemic was and he hid it from the american people he knew it was worse than the flu but he lied to the american people he knew it wasn't going to disappear but he kept telling us a miracle is coming and yesterday he had the gall to suggest that american doctors people are putting their lives on the line on the front lines to save other lives along with nurses and so many others he suggested falsely that they're inflating the number of covades to make more money what in the hell is wrong with this man excuse my language but think about it it's perverted he may believe it because he doesn't do anything for other than for money the people of this nation have suffered and sacrificed for nine months none more so than the doctors on the front lines and health care workers and this president is questioning their character their integrity their commitment to their fellow americans it's more than offensive it's a disgrace especially coming from a president who has waived the white flag of surrender to this virus our front-line health workers they've given their all to beat the virus we have a president who's just given up i will never raise the white flag of surrender we're going to beat this virus we're going to get it under control and the first step to doing that is beating donald trump look donald trump keeps telling us what a great job he's done as president oh man well did you know president obama and i as he pointed out created more jobs in the last three years of our administration than he did in the first three years before the pandemic how about this or did you know donald trump's going to be the first president in 90 years to go to finish his term with fewer jobs under his leadership than when he started look that's a lot of presidents that's a lot of crises but only donald trump is going to have fewer jobs at the end of his presidency than when he started you see i and barack understands something donald trump doesn't wall street didn't build this country you did working people built this country and unions built the middle class he's done nothing of wage war on american labor i see the uaw sign out there first outfit ever endorsed me in 19 when i was a 29 year old kid god love you look we have a different view we believe we should be rewarding work not wealth in this country under my plan if you make less than four hundred thousand dollars a year you're not going to pay a penny in additional taxes but the wealthiest people the biggest corporations 91 of the fortune 500 companies paid zero in federal income tax last year they're going to start to pay their fair share the super wealth are going to pay the same rate they played at the beginning of george bush's administration and corporations are going to start to pay their fair share why should a firefighter an educator a nurse pay a higher tax rate than someone making literally a billion dollars or should you why should you pay more in taxes then donald trump he paid 750 dollars in taxes the one year we know of he's yet to release i've released 22 years of my tax returns you can go online and look he hasn't released one he talks about corruption what is he hiding he owes 41 million bucks out there who's he owed to if you notice he's the only president i know of that a secret bank account in china paid 50 times more taxes in beijing than he's paid in the united states and this guy talks about corruption look we're also going to act to protect health care trump of the republicans just jammed through a supreme court nominee for one overwhelming reason as barack said the president said women they've been trying over 50 shots to take out obamacare destroy the affordable care act but they're going to be in court i believe it's seven days after the election win or lose they're going to be in court if they get their way hundred million americans will lose protections for praises and conditions including more than four million michiganders donald trump thinks healthcare is a privilege barack and i think it's a right for people that bad at healthcare we're not only gonna store obamacare we're gonna build on we're gonna keep your private insurance if you like it and you can choose a medical a medicare-like public option if you don't we're going to increase subsidies to lower your premiums and deductibles out of pocket spending reduce prescription drug costs by 60 percent look we're going to make sure you keep the protections for people of pre-existing conditions meanwhile donald trump laid out what he's going to do in his second term if he's elected to social security the actuary at the social security administration says if he gets that plan passed it will quote bankrupt social security by 2023 something millions of americans live on paid for their whole life when i said back six years ago as debbie will tell you when i said the republicans are going to try to eliminate medicare everybody said no that's crazy first thing paul ryan the republicans in the congress did was try to cut billions of dollars out of medicare these guys mean what they say i'm going to protect social security medicare and medicaid because there's a lifeline for so many hard-working folks but folks i have to admit to you it's kind of personal with me there's nothing worse that this president has done in my view than the way he speaks about our women and men in uniform and those who've given their lives they call them losers and suckers my son beau was a major in the united states army gave up the attorney general's job and petitioned to be able to go with his unit to iraq for one solid year after as a u.s attorney being in kosovo i might add i'm going to be a typical dad he's the only foreigner in kosovo that has a 12-foot memorial dedicated to him the major highway they built the bo biden highway because of his commitment my son came home with a bronze star that could speak of his service but like so many others before he passed away but less what he wasn't a sucker he wasn't a loser or any of you served you're patriots and just like all of your sons and daughters your parents and grandparents who served the president likes to portray himself i love this likes to portray himself as a tough guy when you're in high school wouldn't you have liked to take the shot anyway it's a different story but anyway a macho man but when's the last time you read about saul heard about a present united states literally being laughed at by world leaders when he spoke to the united nations laughed at out loud when's the last time you saw president united states being openly mocked by the leaders of nato at a nato conference and can you believe we have a president who acts like vladimir putin's puppy putin put bounties on the heads of american soldiers serving in iraq and trump was too scared to challenge him talked to him six times has never mentioned it trump's not strong he's weak he commands little respect they're in the international stage this the president who not only doesn't understand sacrifice you don't understand courage physical courage it takes to serve in uniform in a war zone maybe that's why six generals and admirals who work for him left his administration and said he was unfit to command be commander-in-chief when's the last time any president has had that happen tough guy that's why george special operations commander general stanley mcchrystal that's why head of the navy seals oversaw the raid of bin laden admiral bill craven and 22 other four stars have endorsed me say they support me to be their next commander-in-chief because like obama and bush and before him they know we respect them we'll support them i've been in and out of war zones as senator and vice president over 35 times i tell you what these folks we have only one percent of the country is in the military we owe them they're the backbone they're the sinew they're the heart of who we are that's why we have to support our military and get rid of trump folks you know i want to tell you something think about this this is a guy who says there's no such thing as climate change he calls it a hoax i see it as jobs health and safety the impacts on climate are too often fall disproportionately on poor communities and communities of color we're going to make sure communities benefit from the hundreds of billions of federal investment and infrastructure and climate change we're going to do as a consequence of the change in the structure we're going to create local jobs to rebuild roads fill sidewall cracks install broadband create spaces to live work and play safely to modernize infrastructure so you can turn on the faucet and clean water comes out and when that happened in flint will never happen again anywhere in america we can't and must do this donald trump has rolled back more than 100 environmental protection laws many enacted under barack and me it also holds polluted i'll call polluters accountable with the most ambitious environmental justice agenda ever folks we're an act to deliver on racial justice in america protesting is not burning or looting violence has cannot be tolerated and it won't but these protesters is a cry for justice the names of george florida taylor jacob blake will not soon be forgotten they're going to inspire a new wave of justice in america america has had their eyes opened up they're ready look i believe this country has to come together i know when i announced well over a year ago when i said i wanted to unite the country everybody said that's naive that was a long time ago you did it before biden but you can't do it again well we can and we must we have no choice that's how democracies work i'm running as a proud democrat but i will govern as an american president i'll work as hard for those who don't support me as those who do that's the job of a president it's a duty to care a duty to care for everyone so please vote you still have an absentee ballot get it to a drop box as soon as you can you could also safely verdo early until monday afternoon or you can vote election day just make a plan help get out the vote as he's heard us ten times already visit iwillvote.com mi folks we have such an incredible opportunity well god love you thank you very much but here's the deal guys we've got to vote up and down the ticket here i honest to god believe i give you my word as abiding i honestly god believe we're in the cusp we're at an inflection point we have a chance to make such enormous progress because the american people have seen what the other looks like they've gotten a glimpse of the abyss i really mean it they're ready they're ready to change so much i'll never forget what president kennedy said when he promised to send us to the moon he used the phrase that has guided me he said we're doing it because quote we refuse to postpone well i refuse to postpone the incredible opportunities to the united states of america for the american people there is nothing beyond our capacity there is no limit to america's future the only thing that can tear america apart is america itself and that's exactly what donald trump has been doing from the beginning of this campaign dividing america pitting americans against one another based on race gender ethnicity national origin it's wrong it's un-american that's not who we are folks everybody knows who donald trump is let's keep showing though who we are we choose hope over fear we choose unity over division we choose science over fiction and yes we choose truth over lies my fellow americans it's time for us to stand back and stand up and take back our democracy we can do this we're so much better than we've been we can be what we are at our best the united states of america god bless you all and may god protect our troops thank you thank you thank you i'm wondering [Music] i'm [Music] here i am

owe rally have even see new spike after PRON leave town there be just a study by stanford university that just come out show thousand of people be likely to have get sick because of these rally PRON be hold what be PRON obsession by the way with crowd size PRON notice that PRON PRON be always work this be the one measure PRON have of success PRON be still worry about PRON inauguration crowd be small than PRON PRON really bug PRON PRON talk about PRON be still talk about that do PRON have nothing well to worry about do no one come to PRON birthday party when PRON be a kid be PRON traumatize what what what be with crowd well PRON know PRON have PRON have have crowd before PRON know have PRON have quite a few but but PRON know when a country be go through a pandemic that be not what PRON be suppose to be worry about and that be the difference between joe biden and trump right there trump care about feed PRON ego joe care about keep PRON and PRON family safe and PRON be less interested in feed PRON ego with have big crowd then PRON be make sure PRON be not go around make more and more people sick that be what PRON should expect from a president PRON can expect something different from a reality tv star but from a president PRON want PRON to put PRON above PRON own ego look here be the truth michigan this pandemic would have be challenge for any president but this idea that somehow this white house have do anything but completely screw this up be nonsense canada identify PRON first case the same week that the u s do right just a few mile up right PRON be not close i may not be point north but canada be pretty close by PRON mortality rate in the united states be two and a half time high than canada think about that if PRON have the same percentage of folk die in canada as PRON do here nearly americans would have die instead of americans if PRON have handle this pandemic like canada do a hundred and forty thousand of PRON fellow americans may still be alive today think about that think about that and yet despite that last week when trump be ask if PRON would do anything different PRON say not much really not much can not think of anything i listen i i understand the president be be anxious to downplay because PRON want to get credit for the economy that PRON inherit and zero blame for the pandemic PRON ignore but PRON do not work that way the job do not work that way tweet at the tv do not fix thing make stuff up do not make people life well PRON have get to have a plan PRON have get to put in the work and along with the experience to get thing do joe biden have concrete plan and policy that will turn PRON vision of a better fair strong country into reality joe be not go to screw up test joe not go to call scientist idiot PRON be not go to host super spreader event around the country what joe will do be get this pandemic under control with a plan to make testing free and widely available to get a vaccine every american cost free and make sure PRON front line hero never have to ask other country for the equipment that PRON need that be what joe biden will do joe plan will guarantee pay sick leave for worker and parent affect by the pandemic PRON will make sure that small business in every community not just some not just big corporation but small business that hold PRON community together and employ million of americans can reopen safely donald trump like to claim PRON build this economy america create million more job in the last three year of the obama biden administration than in PRON first three year and that be before PRON could blame the pandemic joe biden and i with the help of a democratic congress rescue the auto industry gary peters be there PRON tell PRON to bet on michigan and PRON do and manufacture in michigan grow by percent over PRON last four year trump promise PRON would make michigan the manufacturing hub of the world again PRON be up one percent under PRON first four year under obama biden one percent under PRON that be michigan right here PRON hand PRON the long streak of job growth in american history but the economic damage PRON inflict by botch the pandemic response mean PRON will be the only president since herbert hoover to actually lose job herbert hoover that be a long time ago joe biden and gary peters know that the key to a strong economy be not cut more taxis for billionaire PRON be lift up the prospect for work americans and joe get a plan to create one million new auto relate job by accelerate electric vehicle production PRON be get a plan to create million good clean energy job and fight climate change and secure environmental justice something that be relevant to flint michigan PRON know something about that PRON will and PRON will pay for PRON plan by roll back trump tax cut for billionaire and and this be important joe see this moment not to get back to where PRON be but to build on the progress PRON make together and finally make long overdue change so that PRON economy actually make life a little easy for everybody for the waitress try to raise a kid on PRON own for the student figure out how to pay for next semester class or the shift worker always on the edge of get lay off or the cancer survivor who be worried that PRON pre existing condition protection will be take away let PRON talk about health care for a second let PRON talk about health care for a second republicans love to say right before an election that PRON will protect PRON pre existing condition that be what PRON say well PRON know what joe and i actually protect PRON year ago with the affordable care act and since PRON do so with no help from republicans no vote from republicans republicans have try to repeal or undermine the aca more than time for time PRON have try to take people health care away and and when ask why be PRON why be PRON do that why be PRON be so mean PRON do not think these people should have health care that say no no no PRON have get a new plan PRON be go to be beautiful PRON be go to be terrific except PRON be be year now and PRON still do not have a plan PRON be try to bamboozle PRON instead of actually come up with a plan PRON have attack the aca at every turn PRON have PRON have drive up cost PRON have drive up the number of uninsured now PRON be try to get the supreme court to take PRON health care away in the middle of a pandemic in the mid right at the time when people need health care PRON PRON PRON have sign on to a case right now in the supreme court where PRON be try to take insurance away from folk who need PRON with nothing but empty promise to take PRON place and now mitch mcconnell be pour million of outside super pac dollar into michigan to try to beat gary peters because that be part of PRON agenda michigan here be the truth joel and kamala and gary will protect PRON health care PRON will expand medicare PRON will make insurance more affordable for everybody and the reason PRON know that be true be because PRON be there when PRON do PRON the first time and here be another thing with joe and kamal at the helm this be a big benefit michelle and i be talk about this over dinner the other day PRON be not go to have to think about PRON every day PRON be not go to have to argue with PRON family about PRON every day PRON will not be so exhausting PRON will be able to get on with PRON life know that the president be not go to suggest PRON inject bleach as a possible cure of covet PRON will not have to find out PRON will not PRON PRON will not wake up in the morning and kind of open PRON phone oh newsflash uh the president retweete conspiracy theory that the navy seal do not actually kill bin laden PRON be not go to have a president who go out of PRON way to insult people just because PRON do not support PRON this be not normal behavior people PRON would not tolerate PRON from a teacher or a coach or a co worker or a family member if if a neighbor be act like this PRON would stay away from that neighbor why would PRON accept PRON from the president of the united states and PRON know what there be consequence to this action there be consequence to PRON action PRON be not just a joke PRON be not funny those action embolden other people to be mean and divisive and racist and a phrase be the fabric of all of PRON life and PRON affect how PRON child see the world and how PRON treat each other PRON affect the way PRON family get along PRON affect the way the world see america that be why joe talk about the soul of america that be why PRON PRON talk about decency and and kindness and responsibility and hard work that more than anything be what separate joe biden from PRON opponent PRON actually care about every american PRON do not have a mean spirited bone in PRON body i have see PRON spend spend time with with people that stranger that PRON do not know when PRON hear about PRON be go through a hardship PRON talk about what PRON be go through when PRON see a kid PRON eye light up because because PRON think about PRON own kid and grandkids PRON joe biden try to live the value PRON cherish honesty hard work kindness humility responsibility help somebody else out that use to be the definition of of manliness not strut and show off act important bully people use to be be a man mean take care of PRON other people not go around bragging but but just do the work not look for credit try to live right passing on those value to PRON kid look out for a community carry PRON weight give up a little bit of what what PRON may have to help somebody who have a real need when PRON elect joe that be what PRON will see reflect from the white house and those should not be republican or democratic value PRON do not use to be PRON be what PRON grow up learn from PRON parent and from PRON grandparent and PRON be the value PRON still try to teach PRON kid and PRON be not white or black or hispanic or asian or native american value PRON be american value and PRON have get to reclaim PRON right now but to reclaim PRON PRON be go to have to turn out like never before if PRON be go to reclaim those value PRON need to leave no doubt PRON can not afford to be complacent not this time not in this election PRON get a little complacent the last election and listen i understand why americans get frustrated and sometimes think dumb government be not go to make a difference voting be not go to make a difference i understand that government be not perfect the people in government be not perfect even when PRON be work government be not go to solve every problem but PRON can make thing well a president can not by PRON solve every challenge face the economy here in flint or michigan but if PRON elect people like gary peters and dan kildy and PRON get a house and a senate join with a white house that be more focused on work people and get PRON the help that PRON need PRON will make a difference and some folk will get job that would not otherwise have job and some folk will have health care that would not otherwise have health care a president by PRON can not eliminate all racial bias in PRON criminal justice system but if PRON elect district attorney and state attorney and sheriff focus on equality and justice and PRON once again have a justice department and a civil right division in the justice department that care about these issue PRON can make thing better and that be what voting be about not make thing perfect but make thing well PRON put PRON on a track so that generation from now PRON can look back and say PRON know what right about then thing start get well again the fact that PRON do not get of what PRON want right away that be not a good reason to vote PRON just get to keep at PRON PRON know typically just over of us vote who be eligible think about that almost half of the people in most election who be eligible to vote do not vote imagine if of PRON vote imagine if of PRON vote imagine january th when PRON

be like to have to work hard who be think about work americans and have a plan to help PRON start get ahead imagine what PRON be go to be like to have a president and a vice president who believe in science and who have a plan to protect this planet for PRON child and who believe in racial equality and be send a clear signal that PRON be all in this together and be do the work to bring PRON closer so that PRON have an america where no matter what PRON look like where PRON come from who PRON love or how much money PRON have get PRON PRON can make PRON and PRON have a place and PRON be treat with dignity and respect michigan that be what be possible and PRON be ask PRON to remember that PRON be possible i want PRON to remember what this country can be but PRON can not just imagine a well future PRON can not just wish for PRON PRON have get to fight for PRON PRON got to fight for PRON PRON get to out hustle the other side PRON get to vote up and down the ticket like never before

PRON be more than offensive PRON be a disgrace especially come from a president who have waive the white flag of surrender to this virus PRON front line health worker PRON have give PRON all to beat the virus PRON have a president who be just give up i will never raise the white flag of surrender PRON be go to beat this virus PRON be go to get PRON under control and the first step to do that be beat donald trump look donald trump keep tell PRON what a great job PRON be do as president oh man well do PRON know president obama and i as PRON point out create more job in the last three year of PRON administration than PRON do in the first three year before the pandemic how about this or do PRON know donald trump be go to be the first president in year to go to finish PRON term with few job under PRON leadership than when PRON start look that be a lot of president that be a lot of crisis but only donald trump be go to have few job at the end of PRON presidency than when PRON start PRON see i and barack understand something donald trump do not wall street do not build this country PRON do work people build this country and union build the middle class PRON be do nothing of wage war on american labor i see the uaw sign out there first outfit ever endorse PRON in when i be a year old kid god love PRON look PRON have a different view PRON believe PRON should be reward work not wealth in this country under PRON plan if PRON make less than four hundred thousand dollar a year PRON be not go to pay a penny in additional taxis but the wealthy people the big corporation of the fortune company pay zero in federal income tax last year PRON be go to start to pay PRON fair share the super wealth be go to pay the same rate PRON play at the beginning of george bush administration and corporation be go to start to pay PRON fair share why should a firefighter an educator a nurse pay a high tax rate than someone make literally a billion dollar or should PRON why should PRON pay more in taxis then donald trump PRON pay dollar in taxis the one year PRON know of PRON be yet to release PRON have release year of PRON tax return PRON can go online and look PRON have not release one PRON talk about corruption what be PRON hide PRON owe million buck out there who be PRON owe to if PRON notice PRON be the only president i know of that a secret bank account in china pay time more taxis in beijing than PRON be pay in the united states and this guy talk about corruption look PRON be also go to act to protect health care trump of the republicans just jam through a supreme court nominee for one overwhelming reason as barack say the president say woman PRON have be try over shot to take out obamacare destroy the affordable care act but PRON be go to be in court i believe PRON be seven day after the election win or lose PRON be go to be in court if PRON get PRON way hundred million americans will lose protection for praise and condition include more than four million michigander donald trump think healthcare be a privilege barack and i think PRON be a right for people that bad at healthcare PRON be not only go to store obamacare PRON be go to build on PRON be go to keep PRON private insurance if PRON like PRON and PRON can choose a medical a medicare like public option if PRON do not PRON be go to increase subsidy to lower PRON premium and deductible out of pocket spending reduce prescription drug cost by percent look PRON be go to make sure PRON keep the protection for people of pre existing condition meanwhile donald trump lay out what PRON be go to do in PRON second term if PRON be elect to social security the actuary at the social security administration say if PRON get that plan pass PRON will quote bankrupt social security by something million of americans live on pay for PRON whole life when i say back six year ago as debbie will tell PRON when i say the republicans be go to try to eliminate medicare everybody say no that be crazy first thing paul ryan the republicans in the congress do be try to cut billion of dollar out of medicare these guy mean what PRON say PRON be go to protect social security medicare and medicaid because there be a lifeline for so many hard work folk but folk i have to admit to PRON PRON be kind of personal with PRON there be nothing bad that this president have do in PRON view than the way PRON speak about PRON woman and man in uniform and those who have give PRON life PRON call PRON loser and sucker PRON son beau be a major in the united states army give up the attorney general job and petition to be able to go with PRON unit to iraq for one solid year after as a u s attorney being in kosovo i may add PRON be go to be a typical dad PRON be the only foreigner in kosovo that have a foot memorial dedicate to PRON the major highway PRON build the bo biden highway because of PRON commitment PRON son come home with a bronze star that could speak of PRON service but like so many other before PRON pass away but less what PRON be not a sucker PRON be not a loser or any of PRON serve PRON be patriot and just like all of PRON son and daughter PRON parent and grandparent who serve the president like to portray PRON i love this like to portray PRON as a tough guy when PRON be in high school would not PRON have like to take the shot anyway PRON be a different story but anyway a macho man but when be the last time PRON read about saul hear about a present united states literally be laugh at by world leader when PRON speak to the united nations laugh at out loud when be the last time PRON see president united states be openly mock by the leader of nato at a nato conference and can PRON believe PRON have a president who act like vladimir putin puppy putin put bounty on the head of american soldier serve in iraq and trump be too scared to challenge PRON talk to PRON six time have never mention PRON trump be not strong PRON be weak PRON command little respect PRON be in the international stage this the president who not only do not understand sacrifice PRON do not understand courage physical courage PRON take to serve in uniform in a war zone maybe that be why six general and admiral who work for PRON leave PRON administration and say PRON be unfit to command be commander in chief when be the last time any president have have that happen tough guy that be why george special operations commander general stanley mcchrystal that be why head of the navy seal oversee the raid of bin laden admiral bill craven and other four star have endorse PRON say PRON support PRON to be PRON next commander in chief because like obama and bush and before PRON PRON know PRON respect PRON PRON will support PRON PRON have be in and out of war zone as senator and vice president over time i tell PRON what these folk PRON have only one percent of the country be in the military PRON owe PRON PRON be the backbone PRON be the sinew PRON be the heart of who PRON be that be why PRON have to support PRON military and get rid of trump folk PRON know i want to tell PRON something think about this this be a guy who say there be no such thing as climate change PRON call PRON a hoax i see PRON as job health and safety the impact on climate be too often fall disproportionately on poor community and community of color PRON be go to make sure community benefit from the hundred of billion of federal investment and infrastructure and climate change PRON be go to do as a consequence of the change in the structure PRON be go to create local job to rebuild road fill sidewall crack install broadband create space to live work and play safely to modernize infrastructure so PRON can turn on the faucet and clean water come out and when that happen in flint will never happen again anywhere in america PRON can not and must do this donald trump have roll back more than environmental protection law many enact under barack and PRON PRON also hold polluted PRON will call polluter accountable with the most ambitious environmental justice agenda ever folk PRON be an act to deliver on racial justice in america protest be not burn or loot violence have can not be tolerate and PRON will not but these protester be a cry for justice the name of george florida taylor jacob blake will not soon be forget PRON be go to inspire a new wave of justice in america america have have PRON eye open up PRON be ready look i believe this country have to come together i know when i announce well over a year ago when i say i want to unite the country everybody say that be naive that be a long time ago PRON do PRON before biden but PRON can not do PRON again well PRON can and PRON must PRON have no choice that be how democracy work PRON be run as a proud democrat but i

167,4IXd1jJxBmk,biden,2020-11-03T06:58:33Z,"Obama Campaigns for Biden in Philadelphia, PA (Full Speech + Time Lapse)",speech,hello philadelphia [Applause] man it is good to be back in pennsylvania what beautiful weather we got here a little indian summer you know i know the president spent some time in erie last night and apparently he complained about having to travel here then he cut the event short poor guy i i don't feel that way i love coming to pennsylvania you guys delivered for me twice and i am back here tonight to ask you to deliver the white house for joe biden and kamala harris i want to thank mr philadelphia charlie mack his daughter india marie what an outstanding young lady she was those of you who are fathers and have daughters you know how that feels when when you see your daughters just shining i know a little bit about that and it was great to see representatives brendan boyle mary gay scanlon governor tom wolf attorney general josh shapiro mayor jim kenney philadelphia we got 13 days that's our lucky number right here 13 days until the most important election of our lifetimes you don't have to you don't have to wait for november third to cast your ballot you've got two ways to vote right now number one you can vote early in person through next tuesday how many people anybody here voted early already just if you haven't just go to iwillvote.com pa and find out where you can vote early number two you can vote from home with a mail-in ballot just go to iwillvote.com pa to request your ballot right away and before you send it back pennsylvania's got this thing where you've got to use both envelopes so you've got to read the directions carefully to make sure your vote counts and if you've already voted then you've got to help your friends and family make a plan to vote take them with you if you vote early or if you vote in person on election day because this election requires every single one of us to do our part and what we do these next 13 days will matter for decades to come now the last time i was in philadelphia i was at the constitution center and i was delivering a speech for the democratic national convention this year and i said during that speech i've sat in the oval office with both of the men who are running for president and they are very different people i explained that i never thought donald trump would embrace my vision or continue my policies but i did hope for the sake of the country that he might show some interest in taking the job seriously but it hasn't happened he hasn't shown any interest in doing the work or helping anybody but himself and his friends or treating the presidency like a reality show that he can use to get attention and by the way even then his tv ratings are down so you know that upsets but the thing is this is not a reality show this is reality and the rest of us have had to live with the consequences of him proving himself incapable of taking the job seriously at least 220 000 americans have died more than 100 000 small businesses have closed millions of jobs are gone our proud reputation around the world is in tatters presidents up for re-election usually ask if the country is better off than it was four years ago i'll tell you one thing four years ago you'd be tailgating here at the link instead of watching a speech from your cars the only people truly better off than they were four years ago are the billionaires who got his tax cuts right now as we speak trump won't even extend relief to the millions of families who are having trouble paying the rent or putting food on the table because of this pandemic but he's been doing all right by himself as it turns out this was just reported in the last 48 hours we know that he continues to do business with china because he's got a secret chinese bank account how is that possible how is that possible a secret chinese bank account listen can you imagine if i had a secret chinese bank account when i was running for reelection you think you think my you think fox news might have been a little concerned about that they would have called me beijing barry it is not a great idea to have a president who owes a bunch of money to people overseas that's that's not a good idea i mean of the taxes donald trump pays he may be sending more to foreign governments than he pays in the united states his first year in the white house he only paid 750 dollars in federal income tax listen my first job was at a baskin-robbins when i was 15 years old i think i might have paid more taxes that year working at a dispensing ice cream how is that possible how many people here paid less than that it's possible just possible now that if if you are living high on the hog and you only pay 750 dollars in taxes that maybe just maybe he might not know what working people are going through here in pennsylvania we cannot afford four more years of this philadelphia but the good news is right now you can choose change right now you can vote for my friend joe biden and his running mate kamala harris as the next president and vice president of the united states of america now joe joe's no stranger to he he's a native son scrappy kid from scranton you know him and you know he knows you but let me let me tell you how i came to know him and and how i came to love him 12 years ago when i chose when i chose joe biden as vice president as as my vice presidential running bait i didn't know joe all that well we had served in the senate together but we weren't super close he and i came from different places we came from different generations but i came to admire joe as a man who has learned early on to treat everybody he meets with dignity and respect living by the words his parents taught him no one's better than you joe but you're better than nobody and that empathy that decency that belief that everybody counts that's who joe is that's who he'll be and i can tell you the presidency doesn't change who you are it reveals who you are and joe has shown himself to be a friend of working people for eight years joe was the last one in the room when i faced a big decision he made me a better president and he's got the character and experience to make us a better country and he and kamala are going to be in the fight not for themselves but for every single one of us look i get that this president wants full credit for the economy he inherited and zero blame for the pandemic that he ignored but you know what the job doesn't work that way tweeting at the television doesn't fix things making stuff up doesn't make people's lives better you've got to have a plan you've got to put in the work and along with the experience to get things done joe biden has concrete plans and policies that will turn our vision of a better fairer stronger country into a reality literally left this white house a pandemic playbook that would have shown them how to respond before the virus reached our shores they probably used it to i don't know prop up a wobbly table somewhere we don't know where that playbook went eight months into this pandemic cases are rising again across this country donald trump isn't suddenly going to protect all of us he can't even take the basic steps to protect himself just last night he complained up in erie that the pandemic made him go back to work i'm quoting here he was he was upset that the pandemics made him go back to work if he'd actually been working the whole time it never would have gotten this bad so look here's the truth i want to be honest here this pandemic would have been challenging for any president but this idea that somehow this white house has done anything but completely screw this up is just not true i'll give you a very specific example korea identified its first case at the same time that the united states did at the same time their per capita death toll is just 1.3 percent of what ours is in canada it's just 39 percent of what ours is other countries are still struggling with the pandemic but they're not doing as bad as we are because they've got a government that's actually been paying attention and that means lives lost and that means an economy that doesn't work and just yesterday when asked if he'd do anything differently trump said not much really not much nothing you can think of that could have helped some people keep their loved ones alive so joe's not going to screw up testing he's not going to call scientists idiots he's not going to host a super spreader event at the white house joe will get this pandemic under control with a plan to make testing free and widely available to get a vaccine to every american cost free and to make sure our front line heroes never ask other countries for the equipment they need his plan will guarantee paid sick leave for workers and parents affected by the pandemic and make sure that the small businesses that hold our communities together and employ millions of americans can reopen safely you know donald donald trump likes to claim he built this economy but america created 1.5 million more jobs in the last three years of the obama biden administration than in the first three years of the trump pence administration how you figure that and that was before he could blame the pandemic now he did inherit the longest streak of job growth in american history but just like everything else he inherited he messed it up the economic damage he inflicted by botching the pandemic response means he will be the first president since herbert hoover to actually lose jobs joe's got a plan to create 10 million good clean energy jobs as part of a historic two trillion dollar investment to fight climate change to secure environmental justice and he'll pay he'll pay for it by rolling back that tax cut for billionaires and joe sees this moment not just as a chance to get back to where we were but to finally make long overdue changes so that our economy actually makes life a little easier for everybody the waitress trying to raise her kid on her own the student trying to figure out how to pay for next semester's classes the shift worker who's always on the edge of getting laid off the cancer survivor who's worried about her pre-existing conditions protections being taken away let me tell you saying pennsylvania this i know to be true joe and kamala will protect your health care and expand medicare and make insurance more affordable for everybody you know republicans love to say right before an election that they'll protect your pre-existing conditions now joe and i actually protected your policies to make sure people with pre-existing conditions could get health insurance and have coverage we did it through something called the affordable care act aka obamacare and republicans tried to repeal or undermine it more than 60 times and when they've been asked about they they keep on promising we're going to have a great replacement they said it's coming it's been coming in two weeks for the last 10 years where is it where is this great plan to replace obamacare they've had 10 years to do it there is no plan they've never had one instead they've attacked the affordable care act at every turn driving up costs driving up the uninsured now they're trying to dismantle your care in the supreme court as we speak as quickly as they can in the middle of a pandemic with nothing but empty promises to take its place it's shameful the idea that you would take health care away from people at the very moment where people need it most what is the logic of that there is no logic joe knows that a first the first job of a president is to keep us safe from all threats foreign domestic or microscopic when the daily intelligence briefings flash warning signs about a virus a president can't ignore him he can't be awol just like when russia puts bounties on the heads of our soldiers in afghanistan the commander-in-chief can't be missing an action i i can tell you this joe biden would never call the men and women of our military suckers or losers who does that he knows these these heroes are somebody's children somebody's spouse somebody's dad or mom he understands that and he's going to restore our standing in the world because he knows that america's true strength comes from setting an example that the world wants to follow a nation that stands with democracy not dictators a nation that can mobilize and inspire others to overcome threats like climate change and terrorism and poverty and disease and with joe and kamala at the helm you're not going to have to think about the crazy things they said every day and that's worth a lot you're not going to have to argue about them every day [Music] it just won't be so exhausting you you might be able to have a thanksgiving dinner without having an argument you'll be able to go about your lives knowing that the president is not going to retweet conspiracy theories about secret cabals running the world or or that navy seals didn't actually kill bin laden think about that the president of the united states retweeted that imagine what what we're not going to have a president that goes out of his way to insult anybody who doesn't support him or or threaten them with jail that's not normal presidential behavior we wouldn't tolerate it from a high school principal we wouldn't tolerate it from a coach we wouldn't tolerate it from a co-worker we we wouldn't tolerate it in our own family except for maybe crazy uncle somewhere you know yeah he's he's i mean we why would we expect and ex accept this from the president of the united states and how why are folks making excuses for that oh well that's just that's just him no it's no there are consequences to these actions they embolden other people to be cruel and divisive and racist and it frays the fabric of our society and it affects how our children see things and it affects the ways that our families get along it affects how the world looks at america that behavior matters character matters and by the way while he's doing all that it distracts all of us from the truly destructive actions that his appointees are doing all across the government actions that affect your lives you know the environmental protection agency that's supposed to protect our air and our water is right now run by an energy lobbyist that gives polluters free rain to dump unlimited poison into our air and water the labor department that's supposed to protect workers and their rights right now it's run by a corporate lobbyist who's declared war on workers guts protections to to keep essential folks safe during a pandemic makes it easier for big corporations to shortchange them on their wages the interior department that's supposed to protect our public lands and wild spaces our wildlife and our wilderness and right now that's run by an oil lobbyist who's determined to sell them to the highest bidder you've got the education department that's supposed to give every kid a chance and that's run by a billionaire who guts rules designed to protect students from getting ripped off by for-profit colleges and stiff-arm students looking for loan relief in the middle of an economic collapse i mean the person who runs medicaid right now is doing their best to kick people off of medicaid instead of signing them up for medicaid come on when joe and kamala are in charge they're not going to surround themselves with hacks and lobbyists but they're going to appoint qualified public servants who actually care about looking out for you for your job for your family for your health for your security for your planet and that more than anything is what separates them from their opponents they actually care about every american including the ones that don't agree with them and they're going to fight for you every day they care about you and they care about this democracy they believe in a democracy the right to vote is sacred and that we shouldn't be making people wait in line for 10 hours to cast their ballot we should be making it easier for everybody to vote they believe that no one especially the president is above the law they understand that protest on behalf of social justice isn't un-american that's the most american thing there is that's how this country was founded protesting injustice they understand we don't threaten our political opponents threatening to throw them in jail just because we disagree with them they understand that our ability to work together to solve big problems like a pandemic depends more than on just photo ops it depends on actually learning the facts and following the science and not just making stuff up whenever it's convenient we our democracy is not going to work if the people who are supposed to be our leaders lie every day and just make things up i mean and we've just become numb to it we just become immune to it every single day fact checkers can't keep up and and and look this this notion of truthfulness and democracy and and citizenship and being responsible these aren't republican or democratic principles they're american principles they're what we're they're what we most of us grew up learning from our parents and our grandparents they're not white or black or latino or asian values their american values human values and we need to reclaim them we have to get those values back at the center of our public life and we can but but to do it we've got to turn out like never before we cannot leave any doubt in this election because you know he the president's already said if this is even close i'm going to just make stuff up he's already started to do it so we can't have any doubt we can't be complacent i don't care about the polls there were a whole bunch of polls last time didn't work out because a whole bunch of folks stayed at home and got lazy and complacent not this time not in this election not this side listen listen i i understand why a lot of americans can get frustrated by government and can feel like it doesn't make a difference even supporters of mine during my eight years there were times where stuff we wanted to get done didn't get done and people said well you know gosh if if obama didn't get it done then you know maybe it's just not going to happen look government is not going to solve every problem it's true every elected official is going to make some mistakes this is a big complicated country and the system's designed so that change happens slowly it doesn't happen overnight and and believe me i've got first-hand experience with the way republicans in congress abuse the rules to make it easy for special interest to stop progress but we can make things better and we sh we sure shouldn't be making things worse a president by himself can't solve every challenge in a global economy but if we've got joe biden and kamala harris in the white house and a house and senate that are focused on working people it can make a difference and get millions of people the help they need a president by himself can't eliminate all racial bias in our criminal justice system but if we've got district attorneys and states attorneys and sheriffs and police chiefs focused on equality and justice it can make things better in pennsylvania you just got to flip nine seats in your state house just five seats in your state senate to give democrats control and new life for policies they'll make a real difference to working families right now it can make things better and and it in the end pennsylvania that's what voting is about making things better not making things perfect but putting us on track so that a generation from now we can look back and say things got better starting now and that's what's voting's about voting is about using the power we have and pooling it together to get a government that's more concerned and more responsive and more focused on you and your lives and your children and your grandchildren and future generations and the fact that we don't get 100 of what we want right away is not a good reason not to vote it means we've got to vote and then get some change and then vote some more and then get some more change and then keep on voting until we get it right and we will never come close to seeing what it would be like if everybody voted when i hear people saying well i i don't know your vote don't make a difference we don't know because usually no more than half the people who could be voting vote we get 50 55 percent of people voting and then people say oh look you know not enough change happened well imagine what would happen at 60 percent voted what about 70 percent imagine january 20th when we swear in a president and a vice president who have a plan to get us out of this mess who believe in science and have a plan to protect this planet for our kids and who care about working americans and have a plan to help you start getting ahead and who believe in racial equality and gender equality and and believe in not discriminating against people because of their sexual orientation and are willing to bring us closer to an america where no matter what we look like and where we come from and who we love and what our last name is if we go out there and we work we can make it and we're part of an american family all of that is possible all of that is within our reach if we vote because let me tell you something pennsylvania some people ask me sometimes they say man how have you been able to take these last four years just watching all this how do you how do you keep your spirits up and and i tell them i say look for all the times these last four years that we've seen our worst impulses revealed we've also seen what our country can be at its best we've seen folks of every age and background who've packed city centers and airports in town squares just so families wouldn't be separated so another classroom wouldn't get shot up so our kids wouldn't grow up on an uninhabitable planet we've seen americans of all races joining together to declare in the face of injustice that black lives matter no more but no less so that no child in this country feels the continuing sting of racism we've seen folks our our essential workers our healthcare workers risking their lives day in day out to save somebody else's loved ones we've seen people volunteer and contribute to help those who are having an especially difficult time that right now that's true in pennsylvania that's true all across the country america is a good and decent place but we've just seen so much noise and nonsense that sometimes it's hard for us to remember philadelphia i'm asking you to remember what this country can be what it's like when we treat each other with respect and dignity what it's like when our elected officials actually behave responsibly i'm asking you to believe in joe's ability in kamala's ability to lead this country out of these dark times and help us build it back better because we can't abandon those who are hurting right now we can't abandon the children who aren't getting the education they need right now we can't abandon those protesters who inspired us we've got to channel their activism into action we can't just imagine a better future we've got to fight for it we've got to out hustle the other side we've got to work the other side we've got to vote like never before and leave no doubt so make a plan right now for how you're going to get involved and vote do it as early as you can tell your family tell your friends how they can vote don't stop with joe and kamala make sure you vote all the way down the ticket and if we pour all our efforts into these 13 days if we vote up and down the ticket like never before then we will not only elect joe biden and kamala harris we will also leave no doubt about what this country that we love stands for we will not leave any doubt about who we are as a people and the values and ideals that we embrace what lincoln called the better angels of our nature those are still in us we see him operating every single day we see him in neighborhoods we see him in churches and synagogues and mosques and temples we see him in people helping out a neighbor we see him inside our own families we see that what is best in us is still there but we've got to give it voice and we've got to do it now so let's get to work people let's bring this home i love you philadelphia,b hello philadelphia applause man PRON be good to be back in pennsylvania what beautiful weather PRON get here a little indian summer PRON know i know the president spend some time in

latino or asian value PRON american value human value and PRON need to reclaim PRON PRON have to get those value back at the center of PRON public life and PRON can but but to do PRON PRON have get to turn out like never before PRON can not leave any doubt in this election because PRON know PRON the president be already say if this be even close PRON be go to just make stuff up PRON be already start to do PRON so PRON can not have any doubt PRON can not be complacent i do not care about the poll there be a whole bunch of poll last time do not work out because a whole bunch of folk stay at home and get lazy and complacent not this time not in this election not this side listen listen i i understand why a lot of americans can get frustrate by government and can feel like PRON do not make a difference even supporter of mine during PRON eight year there be time where stuff PRON want to get do do not get do and people say well PRON know gosh if if obama do not get PRON do then PRON know maybe PRON be just not go to happen look government be not go to solve every problem PRON be true every elect official be go to make some mistake this be a big complicated country and the system be design so that change happen slowly PRON do not happen overnight and and believe PRON PRON have get first hand experience with the way republicans in congress abuse the rule to make PRON easy for special interest to stop progress but PRON can make thing well and PRON sh PRON sure should not be make thing bad a president by PRON can not solve every challenge in a global economy but if PRON have get joe biden and kamala harris in the white house and a house and senate that be focus on work people PRON can make a difference and get million of people the help PRON need a president by PRON can not eliminate all racial bias in PRON criminal justice system but if PRON have get district attorney and state attorney and sheriff and police chief focus on equality and justice PRON can make thing better in pennsylvania PRON just get to flip nine seat in PRON state house just five seat in PRON state senate to give democrats control and new life for policy PRON will make a real difference to work family right now PRON can make thing well and and PRON in the end pennsylvania that be what voting be about make thing better not make thing perfect but put PRON on track so that a generation from now PRON can look back and say thing get better start now and that be what be vote be about voting be about use the power PRON have and pool PRON together to get a government that be more concerned and more responsive and more focused on PRON and PRON life and PRON child and PRON grandchild and future generation and the fact that PRON do not get of what PRON want right away be not a good reason not to vote PRON mean PRON have get to vote and then get some change and then vote some more and then get some more change and then keep on vote until PRON get PRON right and PRON will never come close to see what PRON would be like if everybody vote when i hear people say well i i do not know PRON vote do not make a difference PRON do not know because usually no more than half the people who could be vote vote PRON get percent of people vote and then people say oh look PRON know not enough change happen well imagine what would happen at percent vote what about percent imagine january th when PRON swear in a president and a vice president who have a plan to get PRON out of this mess who believe in science and have a plan to protect this planet for PRON kid and who care about work americans and have a plan to help PRON start get ahead and who believe in racial equality and gender equality and and believe in not discriminate against people because of PRON sexual
