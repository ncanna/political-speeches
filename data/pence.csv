senator Rubio senator Scott members of Congress members of the amazing Trump family and my fellow Americans here in Orlando and all across this country Karen and I are thrilled to be with you tonight but we're here for one reason and one reason only America needs four more years of President Donald Trump [Applause] it's on everybody time for round two the 503 day campaign for America's future starts tonight it's amazing to think about it what began four years ago this week has grown into a movement a movement of everyday Americans from every walk of life you believed we could be strong again you believed we could be prosperous again and in President Donald Trump you found a leader who believed in you I don't have to tell any of you gathered here President Donald Trump is the real deal [Applause] he's a man who says what he means and means what he says and he gets up every day and fights to keep the promises we made to the American people he said we'd make America great again and that's exactly what we've done in just two and a half short years I mean think about it he promised to rebuild our military and president Trump signed the largest investment in our national defense since the days of Ronald Reagan [Applause] he promised to stand up to our enemies and stand with our allies and under this commander-in-chief our armed forces captured every last inch of Isis territory and this president kept a promise made by four of his predecessors when he moved our embassy to Jerusalem the capital of the State of Israel he promised our veterans the real-time world-class health care that you earned in the uniform of the United States and President Donald Trump delivered we reform the VA and veterans choice is now the law and this president's given the men and women of law enforcement the resources and the respect that they deserve every day violent crime is down and under the president's leadership we are waging an unprecedented fight against opioid abuse and addiction all across America and of course under president Trump's leadership we've made historic investments to secure our southern border [Applause] we've supported Customs and Border Protection we've stood by the courageous men and women of ice and thanks to the president stand Mexico has done more to secure our border in the last 10 days than the Democrats in Congress have done in the last 10 years and with President Trump's national emergency declaration we've already started to build that wall and President Trump kept his word when he's appointed more principled conservatives to our federal courts in the last two years than any president in American history and they're all men and women will uphold all the god-given liberties enshrined in our Constitution like the freedom of religion the freedom of speech and the Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms [Applause] and while leading voices in the Democratic Party advocate late term abortion and even defend infanticide I couldn't be more proud to serve alongside a president who stands without apology to the sanctity of human life and beyond all that President Trump promised to revive the American economy by rolling back red tape unleash an American energy fighting for fair trade deals and cutting taxes and president Trump delivered 5.8 million new jobs since election day and the unemployment rate has hit a 50-year low more Americans are working today than ever before the truth is jobs are back confidence is back and thanks to the leadership for president Donald Trump America is back and we're just getting started that's what we call promises made and promises capped but to keep America great we have to reelect a president who's been fighting for you every day we've done so much but there's much more to do that's why we need four more years of President Donald Trump in the White House [Applause] [Applause] four more years means more jobs more judges more support for our troops and it's going to take at least four more years to drain that swamp you know the choice in this election couldn't be clearer and the stakes couldn't be higher today we have a president who loves this country who never quits who never backs down who believes in you and fights for you and President Donald Trump believes in freedom any other party there candidates believe in more taxes more regulation and less free today Democrats openly advocate socialism an economic system that is impoverished millions of people around the world and stole the liberties of generations but it was freedom not socialism that gave us the most prosperous economy in the history of the world it was freedom not socialism that ended slavery one two world wars and stands today as a beacon of hope for all the world the moment America becomes a socialist country is the moment America ceases to be America so as the president said in his State of the Union address so we must say with one voice America will

would you all join me in thanking the great administrator of NASA for the work he is doing to revive American leadership in space and all the extraordinary leaders and innovators gathered here from all across America and all around the world men and women who are share who share our vision for human exploration for American and worldwide innovation carrying us back to the vast expanse of space it is my great honor to welcome all of you to this incredible gathering celebrating the power of the past and the promise of the future the opening ceremony of the 70th International Astronautical Congress welcome to Washington DC and as I begin allow me to bring greetings from a man who is committed to renewing American leadership here on earth and in the boundless expanse of space and who has brought a renewed vigor and vision to America's space enterprise I bring greetings from the 45th President of the United States of America President Donald Trump you know the United States has always been a nation of restless pioneers ever striving to explore the Uncharted lands reach new horizons and venture into the unknown including efforts to expand the boundaries of human knowledge earlier this year the world paid tribute to three great Americans and to the 400,000 men and women who made their journey possible 50 years ago this year when those three Americans and all who support them undertook the most hazardous and dangerous and greatest adventure upon which mankind had ever embarked they turned one small step for man into one giant leap for mankind and today you'll help celebrate that so would you join me in congratulating the 2019 world space award winners the crew of Apollo 11 [Applause] including the incomparable Buzz Aldrin who is with us here today the grandson of Michael Collins and the son of commander Neil Armstrong mark Armstrong let's hear it everybody [Applause] it's an honor to be with all of you and to remember the extraordinary contributions that you Buzz and your family members made to mankind fifty years ago and as I stand before you today as we remember the past I'm proud to report that the United States of America is renewing the legacy of those courageous space pioneers and all they represent because under President Donald Trump's leadership America is leading in space once again in our very first year in office after it had lain dormant for nearly a quarter of a century president Trump revived the National Space Council to coordinate space activities across the whole of government and it is as Jim bridenstine said my great honor to serve as chairman of the National Space Council as other vice presidents have done before me at president Trump's direction we've renewed America's commitment to human space exploration vowing to go further into space than ever before in our first year in office the president signed what came to be known as space policy directive 1 making the national policy of the United States of America to return to the moon and prioritize crewed missions to the lunar surface and earlier this year President Trump made it the policy of this administration to return to the moon by 2024 ensuring that the next man and the first woman on the moon will both be American astronauts in fact as you just heard NASA made history this past week when it successfully performed the first unmanned space walk the first all woman spacewalk is history so join me in congratulating American astronauts Jessica Mir and Christina cook for their historic accomplishments past present and future [Applause] as president Trump has said we will return American astronauts to the moon for the first time since 1972 for long-term exploration and use not only to plant our flag and leave our footprint but to establish a foundation for an eventual mission to Mars with Apollo in the history books the Artemis mission has begun and we are well on our way to making NASA's moon to Mars mission a reality in order for us to take this next big leap we'll develop the technologies to live on the moon for months and even years we'll learn how to make use of resources that the moon has to offer that includes mining oxygen from from the lunar surface and rocks to fuel reusable Landers extracting water from the permanently shadowed craters of the South Pole and developing a new generation of nuclear-powered spacecraft that will help us fly further and farther and faster than ever before so we're going back to the moon and then to Mars and we're taking steps to ensure that the American space industry is up to the task as well working with our partners from the user advisory group we've promulgated a long range of reforms to invigorate a commercial space sector across this country and across the world in fact I know that many members of the user advisory group leaders in industry that are giving counsel to our nation's space efforts are with us today with the members of the user advisory group please stand and allow all of these colleagues to show their appreciation to each and every one of you thank you all I want to thank I want to thank Admiral Jim Ellis and all the distinguished members of the National Space councils user advisory group working with each and one of them and in close cooperation with our allies around the world including many of the nation's represented here we've encouraged a more stable space environment by developing the world's first comprehensive space traffic management policy and the guidance of our user advisory group assisted with that our administration is committed to ensuring that the United States also leverages the power of private enterprise in space and even now NASA is leading a commercial friendly effort to develop orbital platforms that will one day replace the International Space Station as well as the human lunar landers that will carry us back to the moon today thanks to the leadership the president Trump has provided the United States of America is open for business to all space enterprises as we build up confidence in the opportunities that space can provide we've unleashed the American space industry as never before evidence of that in August SpaceX carried more than 3,300 pounds of samples in cargo down to earth at the conclusion of its 18th commercial resupply mission for the International Space Station two weeks ago Northrop Grumman made history when it launched the first ever commercial satellite servicing spacecraft which will not only extend the life span of several satellites but also paved the way for in space manufacturing and just last week Leo labs announced the operation of its advanced Kiwi space radar which has the capability to track debris in space as small as two centimeters and will help protect billions of dollars in spacecraft and satellites from colliding with dangerous objects in orbit and space companies have driven incredible economic growth around the globe I know that's well understood in this room and by all that are looking on in the first half of this year we've seen almost as much invested in space companies as we did in the entire year before in fact in the last decade nearly 25 billion dollars has been invested in nearly 500 different space companies and I'm proud to say that the majority of those investments have been directed to American businesses our continued success in space will require close cooperation of all of us across governments universities and the commercial space industry which is what makes this 70th International Astronautical Congress so important the good news is that with the renewed American leadership in space we're also seeing renewed cooperation among freedom-loving nations around the world to advance space exploration already as I stand here today eighteen of the nations represented here have proven their ability to work together through the nineteen year mission of the International Space Station and just last month Australia announced a historic 150 million dollar investment in the burgeoning space industry in their country including through support of NASA's Artemis lunar program and our future mission to Mars Canada has already agreed to support development of the lunar gateway a critical outpost and refueling station that'll help us develop technologies test the systems and train the astronauts for the first-ever crewed mission to Mars and just last week Prime Minister Robby announced Japan's intention to join our efforts both in the lunar gateway and on the lunar surface Japan has been a vital partner of the International Space Station in our mutual defense and in countless other endeavors and so we are grateful for this most recent sign of Japan's enduring commitment to a partnership for their support of our moon to Mars mission and as I stand before you today even now I know that our friends and allies in Europe are holding active discussions about involvement in our space exploration missions so on behalf of the United States of America let me say to all of our allies and partners in space thank you for working with us to advance human understanding in space we will do it together [Applause] now bring president Trump revive the National Space Council he said that it he believed as I do that it's America's destiny to be the leader amongst nations on our adventure into the great unknown in American history has proven that out but to be clear our vision is to be the leader among freedom-loving nations on the adventure into the great unknown and here at this International Astronautical Congress let me say the United States of America will always be willing to work closely with like-minded freedom-loving nations as we lead mankind into the final frontier as more nations gain the ability to explore space and develop places beyond the Earth's atmosphere we must also ensure we must also ensure that we carry into space our shared commitment to freedom the rule of law and private property the long term exploration and development of the moon Mars and other celestial bodies will require the use of resources found in outer space including water and minerals and so we must encourage the responsible commercial use of these resources this is why the United States will continue to honor international law and existing space agreements that protect private property while pursuing new policies that build trust with our allies our commercial partners and other spacefaring nations we will use all available legal and diplomatic means to create a stable and orderly space environment that drives opportunity creates prosperity and ensures our security on earth and in the vast expanse of space space plays a critical role in our national security as it does for every nation around the world and to that end President Trump has directed our administration to work with bipartisan leadership in Congress and soon we will stand up the sixth branch of our armed forces the United States space force soon it will be a reality and the space force will be a vanguard to defending our nation defending our freedom and defending the rights of all freedom-loving nations in the vast expanse of space so it's an honor to be with all of you today to be able to update you briefly on the progress that we're making and I know this is going to be a momentous week as you gather here at this important international conference I hope you will leave America's capital with a with confidence that America is leading in space again and that we are determined to lead be the leader amongst freedom-loving nations into the vast expanse of space we're opening the doors for private space enterprise to develop the means and technology for low Earth orbit and with the president's vision for NASA's renewed moon to Mars mission I truly believe that working with so many of the nation's gathered here we will once again inspire the world by the heights we reach in history we may so thank you for the opportunity of addressing each one of you today you know it is said it is said without a vision two people perish and I would offer today that so to do great endeavors the truth is for more than a generation a vision for human space exploration had languished in this country and around the world but those days are over with America's renewed vision for human space exploration we will lead mankind into the vast expanse of space the task before us will involve hardship and hazard sacrifice and determination and it will require faith faith in the boundless capacity of American ingenuity and the ingenuity of and cooperation of freedom-loving nations around the world faith in the extraordinary courage of the men and women who even now train and prepare to move the boundary lines of human knowledge and faith as generations of Americans have long believed that even if we rise on the wings of the dawn even if we go up to the heavens even there his hand will guide us his right hand will hold us fast so thank you for the opportunity of addressing you today and helping to begin what I know will be an important week in the space Enterprise in our nation and around the world and I'm confident with the leadership for president Donald Trump with the courage of a new generation of explorers with the strong support and cooperation of our private partners and with the strong cooperation of all of our freedom-loving international allies and with God's help we will lead the world into the vast expanse of

had a great day on the bus traveling all across this state but I'm here in Hershey tonight for one reason and one reason only and that is that Pennsylvania and America need four more years of President Donald Trump in the White House [Applause] you know I'm here because I stand with President Donald Trump and when this president stands up for American jobs and American workers I stand with President Donald Trump when this president stands up for faith and freedom and a strong national defense I stand with President Donald Trump and like all of you when this president stands up to the do-nothing Democrats they're endless investigations and their partisan impeachment we stand with President Donald Trump you know what began four years ago has grown into a movement it's a movement of everyday Americans from every walk of life here in Pennsylvania you believe we could be strong again you believe we could be prosperous again Pennsylvania said yes to President Donald Trump in 2016 and I know Pennsylvania's going to say yes to four more years of President Donald Trump in 2020 you know I think there's only one way you can describe the last three years it's been amazing [Applause] it's been three years of action three years of results it's been three years of promises made and promises kept and we're just getting started Pennsylvania let me think about it think about this president promise to rebuild our military President Donald Trump delivery this president has already signed the largest investment in our national defense since the days of Ronald Reagan we're finally giving our soldiers sailors airmen Marines and Coast Guard the resources and support they need to accomplish their mission and defend this nation again and with the defense bill announced just today President Trump has secured even more money for our military another pay raise for our troops and history will record that president Donald Trump established the United States space force [Applause] [Applause] you know I believe the President Trump is the best friend the United States Armed Forces have ever had do under this commander-in-chief we made the strongest military in the history of the world stronger still and with that renewed American strength we've taken the fight to radical Islamic terrorists on our Terms on their soil in the last year alone American forces at the direction of this commander-in-chief captured the last inch of territory beneath the black flag of Isis and just about a month ago as the world watched US Special Forces took out the leader of Isis without one American casualty al Baghdady is gone and Conan the hero dog is just fine [Applause] and this president also understood that national security begins with border security and we've made historic investments to secure our borders and as I stand before you today apprehensions on our southern border are down by 70% and we've already started to build that wall on the southern border of the United States [Applause] oh we're building now we're building it you know and on a day on a day when we lost a police officer in the line of duty in New Jersey and a trooper was shot right here in Pennsylvania I promise you this president and this administration will always stand with the men and women who serve on the thin blue line of law enforcement and to uphold the rule of law this president has kept another promise by appointing principled conservatives to our federal courts at every level president Trump has already appointed 170 men and women to our federal courts and I can tell you firsthand they are all judges who will uphold the god-given liberties enshrined in our Constitution and Bill of Rights like the freedom of religion the freedom of speech and the Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms and I couldn't be more proud to serve as vice president to a president who stands without apology for the sanctity of human life President Donald Trump is the most pro-life president in American history so it's about security it's about liberty it's about our values and men and women of Pennsylvania it's about jobs jobs jobs from the first day of this administration President Trump promised to revive the American economy we cut taxes we rolled back red tape we Unleashed American energy and fought for free and fair trade and the American economy is booming since election day 2016 as of last week businesses large and small have created seven million jobs all across this country unemployment is at a 50-year low the stock market is setting records and there are more Americans working today than ever before in American history and this presidents also worked to open up markets around the world we put China on notice that the era of economics surrender is over and as you all maybe already heard today one year ago President Trump signed the largest trade deal in American history and today the Democrats in Congress finally agreed to pass the u-s AMCA it only took them a year the u.s. MCA is a win for American workers and American farmers is going to create hundreds of thousands of jobs all across this state and nation and I got to tell you okay there's a lot of people out there taking credit for the u.s. MCA but I was there every step of the way and make no mistake about it President Donald Trump got it done [Applause] I mean thanks to this president's leadership support of all of you and our allies in the Congress so many of which are here today we've made America great again but to keep America great we need you to decide right here and right now that Pennsylvania's going to vote for four more years of President Donald Trump in the White House [Applause] I mean think about it four more years means more jobs four more years means more judges four more years means more support for our troops and it's going to take at least four more years to drain that swamp [Applause] you know the choice the choice in this election couldn't be clearer the stakes couldn't be higher today we have a president who loves this country he stands by our military's our workers and our freedom he never quits he never backs down he believes in you and fights for you every single day today's Democratic Party [Applause] means today's Democratic Party's been taken over by radical leftists who on higher taxes open borders late term abortion and socialist policies that would crush this economy and today you saw the news the do-nothing Democrats even announced articles of impeachment against our president [Applause] what a disgrace you know the truth is they're trying to impeach this president because they know they can't defeat this president they can't run against our record they can't run against his results they're pushing this baseless and partisan impeachment because they know they can't stop you from giving president Donald Trump four more years in the White House [Applause] but despite despite three years of endless investigations and their so-called resistance I can tell you firsthand I've seen it every day president Donald Trump has never stopped fighting for you and now Pennsylvania it's our turn to fight for him it's on we need you to bring your enthusiasm just like tonight we need you to keep voicing your support we need you to get registered to vote Pennsylvania we got a big election next year keep telling your neighbors and your friends in Pennsylvania in America need four more years of President Donald Trump and we will get this done in November of 2020 I believe it I believe it because I have faith faith in my friend the President of the United States whose boundless energy drive and vision have made America great again in three short years we need to have faith in our fellow Americans who know we've turned this country around and know we can make America and Pennsylvania greater than ever before and lastly as we go into next year's election let's have faith let's have faith that he who blessed this Commonwealth and this one nation under God

one reason and one reason only and that is that Ohio and America need four more years of President Donald Trump in the White House [Applause] you know like all of you I'm here because I stand with President Donald Trump when this president stands up for American jobs and American workers I stand with President Donald Trump when this president stands up for faith and freedom and the American flag I stand with President Donald Trump and when this President as commander in chief takes decisive action to defend American lives we stand with President Donald Trump [Applause] you know what began four years ago has grown into a movement a movement of everyday Americans from every walk of life here in Ohio you believed we could be strong again you believed we could be prosperous again Ohio said yes to President Donald Trump in 2016 and I know Ohio is going to say yes to four more years of President Donald Trump in 2020 you know when you think of the last three years you got to admit it's been three years of action it's been three years of results it's been three years of promises made and promises kept and we're just getting started Ohio I mean think about it president Trump promised to rebuild our military and this president has signed the largest increase in our national defense since the days of Ronald Reagan [Applause] under this commander-in-chief we've made the strongest military in the history of the world stronger still and with that renewed American strength we've taken the fight against radical Islamic terrorists on our terms on their soil you know where the last administration sent pallets of cash to terrorists in Iran under this president we got out of the Iran nuclear deal and when one American life was lost at the hands of iranian-backed militias just a few short weeks ago President Trump launched the first air strikes against iranian-backed militias in ten years and when militants stormed our embassy in Baghdad President Trump sent in the Marines secured our embassy and this president said no more Benghazi and when American lives were threatened by the most dangerous terrorist in the world president Donald Trump took action and Qasem Soleimani is gone [Applause] and in the wake of that attack Iran responded but thanks to the professionalism of our military we suffered no American casualties and Iran appears to be standing down that's what leadership looks like that's the leadership of President Donald Trump now the president said yesterday in his words the United States is always ready to embrace peace with all who seek it but under this president America will always seek peace through strength [Applause] so we've rebuilt our military but to ensure American dominance on land and sea and air and space President Trump launched the first new branch of our armed forces in 70 years the United States space force has arrived [Applause] [Music] [Applause] but this president also knows the national security starts with border security and under his leadership we've made historic investments in border security apprehensions on our southern border are down by 70% and we've already started to build that wall [Applause] and this president and our administration has stood strong for the men and women who serve on the thin blue line and on this national law enforcement appreciation day let's say thank you to all who serve and protect and to support the rule of law president Trump has already appointed more than a hundred and eighty principled conservatives to our courts at every level and I'm here to tell you they're all men and women who will uphold all the god-given liberties enshrined in our Constitution like the freedom of speech the freedom of religion and the Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms and I couldn't be more proud to serve as vice president to the most pro-life president in American history so it's about security it's about liberty it's about our values and under the leadership of President Donald Trump it's about jobs jobs jobs from the first day of this administration President Trump promised to revive the American economy he went straight to work we cut taxes across the board we rolled back red tape at historic levels we unleashed American energy and fought for free and fair trade and the American economy is booming since Election Day 2016 businesses large and small across this country have created more than seven million good-paying jobs including almost 95,000 jobs right here in the Buckeye State unemployment is at a 50-year low the stock market is soaring and more Americans are working today than ever before I mean the truth is thanks to president Trump's leadership and the strong support of Ohio's conservatives in Congress we've made America great again [Applause] but to keep America great we need you to decide right here and right now that Ohio is going to vote for four more years of President Donald Trump in the White House [Applause] more years means more jobs four more years means more judges four more years means more support for our troops and it's going to take at least four more years to drain that swamp you know the choice in this election couldn't be clearer the stakes couldn't be higher today we have a president who loves this country who stands by our military our workers and our freedom he never quits he never backs down he believes in you and fights for you every single day and the contrast is today's Democratic Party has been taken over by radical leftists who want higher taxes open borders late-term abortion and socialist policies that would crush this economy and worst of all after a sham investigation those do-nothing Democrats in Congress actually voted to impeach our president they rushed their partisan impeachment through the house remember they said it was urgent and now Nancy Pelosi has been sitting on those articles of impeachment for almost a month [Applause] it's a disgrace you know the truth is Democrats are trying to run down this president because they know they can't run against this president they're trying to impeach president Trump because they know they can't defeat President Trump in November of 2020 you know well House Democrats had their say in December Senate Republicans are gonna have their say real soon and come this November the American people are gonna have our say when we vote to send President Trump back to the White House for four more years you know but for all we've accomplished despite three years of non-stop resistance I can tell you

hope of Earth that he will yet bless oh hi oh and America beyond anything we could ask or imagine for in the words of your state motto the people of Ohio know with God all things are possible [Applause] ladies and gentlemen I can tell you President Donald Trump is the real deal he's a man who says what he means and means what he says he gets up every day and fights to keep the promises he made to the American people and I know that with your continued support with our strong allies in Congress and in your Statehouse and with God's health we're gonna deliver a great victory for the

52,GwLjM8EqP2o,pence,2020-06-21T01:40:09Z,"Vice President Mike Pence speaks at a Make America Great Again Rally in Tulsa, OK | FULL SPEECH",speech,"[Applause] well hello Oklahoma to governor Kevin stead the members of Congress members of the incredible Trump family my fellow Americans who've come from near and far it is great to be back in the Sooner State for a great American comeback but I need to tell you I'm here for one reason and one reason only and that is that Oklahoma and America need four more years of President Donald Trump in the White House it's on America and the road to victory starts right here you know I'm here because I stand with President Donald Trump when this president stands up for American jobs and American workers I stand with President Donald Trump when this president stands up for faith and family and the American flag I stand with President Donald Trump and when this president stands up to the radical left and their socialist agenda I stand with President Donald Trump and when our president stands up for law and order and liberty and justice for all we stand with President Donald Trump you know four years ago a movement was born and it looks like it's doing just fine tonight it's a movement of everyday Americans from every walk of life here in Oklahoma you believe we could be strong again you believe we could be prosperous again you said yes to President Donald Trump in 2016 and I know Oklahoma is going to say yes to four more years of President Donald Trump in 2020 you know the choice in this election couldn't be clearer and the stakes couldn't be higher on our side you've got a president who's done more for this country's economy and military and our constitutional rights than any president in my lifetime he's delivered three years of action three years of results three years of promises made and promises capped and then you got Joe Biden I mean think about the contrast President Trump cut taxes for working families small businesses and family farms and Joe Biden wants to raise your taxes president Trump signed more laws cutting federal red tape than any president in American history and Joe Biden wants to bury our economy under an avalanche of red tape like the green New Deal President Trump has stood up to China and put American jobs and American workers first and Joe Biden wants to go back to economics surrender Joe Biden will cost America jobs and by contrast President Trump created more than 7 million jobs in our first three years and as we open up America again we've already seen three million jobs created in a single month and set a record for retail sales the great American comeback has begun and President Trump is leading the way and when it comes to our national defense president Trump rebuild our military he restored the Arsenal democracy and this President signed the largest increase in our national defense since the days of Ronald Reagan Joe Biden and the Democrats they neglected our military support budget cutbacks and ignored threats abroad you know under this president with our renewed strength we've taken the fight to radical Islamic terrorists on our terms on their soil you know when Joe Biden saw Isis overrun the hard-won ground in Iraq last year under this commander-in-chief American forces captured the last inch of territory of Isis control and we took down their leader without one American casualty and remember when joe biden's sent pallets of cash to terrorists and around well president Trump got us out of the disastrous Iran nuclear deal in Qasem Soleimani is gone you know as the father of the United States Marine I couldn't be prouder to serve alongside a president who cares so deeply about the men and women of our armed forces so the choice is clear on jobs on national security and this president also knows that national security starts with border security I mean Joe Biden supports open borders President Trump is already building that wall on the southern border of the United States while we're building now you'll see and this president from the first day of this administration has stood for law and order and stood with the incredible men and women of law enforcement at every level you know the American people know that most of those who serve in the uniform of law enforcement are the best people in America and we all know what happened to George Floyd was a tragedy that shocked the conscience of the nation and justice will be served [Music] there's no excuse for what happened to George Floyd but there's also no excuse for the rioting looting and violence that followed when rioters were destroying property in cities across the country Joe Biden issued a press release President Donald Trump sent in the National Guard he secured our nation's capital and called on every governor in America to do the same and in the days that followed you saw it we quelled the violence and since then we've been working with law enforcement and leaders in our african-american community to improve public safety and improve the lives of our african-american neighbors we're listening we're learning we're leading and we'll find ways to move forward together but one thing we're not going to do we're not going to defund the police not now not ever and when it comes to the rule of law Joe Biden is making plans to appoint activist judges who are legislate from the bench but next week President Trump will appoint his 200th judge to our federal court and they're all conservative jurists who are holding the god-given liberties enshrined in our Constitution like the freedom of speech the freedom of religion and the Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms and with four more years this president will appoint even more judges and like we learned this past week we need more conservative justices on the Supreme Court of the United States and finally while Joe Biden supports taxpayer funding of abortion and was just endorsed by Planned Parenthood I couldn't be more proud to be vice president for a president who stands without apology for the right to life so for American strength for American jobs for law and order and liberties and life we've got to decide right here and right now that we're going to defeat Joe Biden on November 3rd and reelect President Trump for four more years you know because it's not just the record of success it's about leadership and the leadership this president has shown and one of the most challenging times any of us can remember did you know before we had a single coronavirus case in the United States President Donald Trump closed down all travel from China he put the health of America first and with the president's leadership we stood up a national response we delivered hundreds of millions of medical supplies to health care workers in all 50 states we reinvented testing from a standing start and now we're testing almost 500,000 Americans every single day working with American free enterprise we manufactured medical equipment on a wartime footing and no American who required a ventilator was ever denied a ventilator in the United States that's a national accomplishment and now all 50 states are opening up America again people are going back to work and worship we're getting back at the stores and restaurants in the great outdoors the transition to greatness has begun and despite the fear-mongering of some in the media the truth is all across this country hospitalizations are down our losses are declining and every day we're one day closer to putting the coronavirus in the past you're doing it America but I want to promise you we're going to remain vigilant we'll keep building supplies we'll keep developing medicines and vaccines we'll be ready for whatever the future holds and we will always put the health of America first that's what leadership looks like that's the leadership of President Donald Trump so my fellow Americans get ready buckle up it's on we've got a little more than four months to win four more years for president Donald Trump in the White House so get ready to bring it just like you did four years ago bring the enthusiasm keep voicing your support keep telling your neighbors and friends all that we've accomplished and what this president can do with four more years in the White House I mean think about it four more years means more jobs four more years means more judges four more years means more support for our troops and it's going to take at least four more years to drain that swamp and when we do all that I believe with all my heart over the next four years we're going to bring this country together America will be stronger than ever before more jobs and opportunities than ever before and America will be a place where every American regardless of race or creed or color or income can work and worship in freedom choose where their child goes to school find a good-paying job and live the American dream so thank you for coming out tonight [Music] I'm gonna get on my way and let you hear from him yourself but I must say it's the greatest honor of my life to be your vice president and I want to thank you for the privilege and in all my travels across this country from big cities to small towns over the last four years I can tell you firsthand America is a freedom-loving nation and America is a nation of faith and as we open up America again and reclaim the freedom that we were willing to set aside for the health of our neighbors I can't help but think that we come into this year cherishing and appreciating our freedom even more so every day between now and November 3rd go out and defend the freedom that's always made this nation great and while you're doing it have faith faith that in these challenging times that if his people who were called by his name will humble themselves and pray he'll do like he's always done through the long and storied history of this land he'll hear from heaven he'll heal this land this one nation under God indivisible with liberty and justice for all so pray for America for all the American food ladies and gentlemen President Donald Trump is the real deal he's a man who says what he means it means what he says he never quits he never backs down and I can tell you firsthand he's never stopped fighting to keep the promises that he made to the American people and now it's our turn to fight for him and I just know that with your continued support and prayers every day between now and November third we're gonna have that great American comeback we're going to make Oklahoma and America is stronger and more prosperous than ever before and with President Donald Trump in the White House for four more years and with God's help we will make America great again again Thank You Oklahoma god bless you",b applause well hello oklahoma to governor kevin stead the member of congress member of the incredible

representatives for 12 years before i went home to be governor of indiana it was 12 years and i have to tell you it seemed longer but it is a remarkable thing when you see men and women who who carry the very same principles that carried them to washington d.c i have to tell you those that are gathered here arizona should be proud of the principled conservative delegation that you've sent to washington d.c they make a difference every day they really do it really is great to be with so many friends and speaking of friends allow me to bring greetings and gratitude from another friend of mine who loves the state of arizona and when i told him i was headed your way last night i think he sounded just a little bit jealous so allow me to bring greetings from a champion of life and liberty and the 45th president of the united states of america president donald trump it really is great to be with all of you today but i got to be honest with you i'm here for one reason and one reason only and that is that arizona and america need four more years of president donald trump in the white house you know four more years means more jobs four more years means more judges four more years means more support for our troops and it's going to take at least four more years to drain that swamp [Applause] you know i don't know if you all heard the news but on the way here i just heard that joe biden named his running mate california senator kamala harris will be the democrat candidate for vice president so let me take this opportunity to welcome her to the race i mean we all know look joe biden and the democratic party have been overtaken by the radical left so given their promises of higher taxes open borders socialized medicine and abortion on demand it's it's no surprise that he chose senator harris to be his running act you all might like to know that the vice presidential debate is going to be held on october 7th in utah so my message to the democratic candidate for vice president congratulations i'll see you in salt lake city [Applause] you know i remember the day that i got the call to join this ticket about four years ago this time karen and i had prayed all the way through it and i said yes in a heartbeat because i knew then that donald trump had the vision the leadership and the strength to make america great again and in four short years that's just what we've done i mean from the first day of this administration president trump has been working to keep the promises that he made to the people of arizona and people all across this country especially this president has worked every day i can attest to keep the promises that he has made to people of faith we've stood for the sanctity of life without apology we've stood for religious liberty of every american of every faith we've made the strongest military in the history of the world stronger still we've rebuilt our military and restored the arsenal of democracy you know i have to tell you as the proud father of a united states marine who's stationed right here in arizona and as the proud father-in-law of a united states navy pilot i couldn't be more proud to be vice president to a president who has so supported the men and women of our armed forces we're finally giving our soldiers sailors airmen marines and coast guard the resources and the support they need to accomplish their mission and defend this nation true and this president has also appointed more conservatives to our court of appeals than any president in american history in the midst of all of that in our first three years with the strong support of these conservatives in the congress we revived the american economy with less taxes less regulation more american energy and the kind of trade deals that put american jobs and american workers first amazing in those first three years this president kept all the promises that he made to the people of arizona and then some we cut those taxes across the board for working families and businesses large and small in fact this president signed more bills cutting federal red tape than any president in american history and the usmca is now the law of the land it's a win for america and a win for arizona we unleashed american energy and in the midst of all of that in those first three years american businesses created more than seven million good-paying jobs and then the coronavirus pandemic hit and it's been a challenging time especially especially over the last several months here in the state of arizona you know early in this pandemic the american people saw the leadership of president trump shine forth this president marshaled not only a whole of government response but a whole of america response we reinvented testing and now america has done more testing for the coronavirus than any nation on earth we arranged for the manufacturing delivery of hundreds of millions of medical supplies to all of the incredible health care workers and hospitals all across this country we've been working around the clock since february of this year developing medicines known as therapeutics at a record pace and i'm proud to say that we are well on our way to having the first coronavirus vaccine before the end of this year now we have a ways to go and we all have a role to play to protect the vulnerable to save lives and i know the people of arizona will continue to do that there's not a day gone by since the president tapped me to lead the white house coronavirus task force that i haven't thought of the families that have suffered loss today our hearts are with more than the more than 160 000 american families that have lost loved ones but our hearts are also filled with gratitude to the amazing first responders the amazing doctors nurses and health care workers who have been nothing less than heroic all through this pandemic and they have our thanks let me say to the people of arizona we're encouraged by the progress that you're making in the grand canyon state and the progress we're seeing all across the sun belt because of this president's leadership in all of our efforts because of the strong leadership here in the state of arizona in this challenging time i continue to receive reports that cases are coming down in arizona positive tests are coming down and the economy is coming back thank you governor doug ducey for your strong steady and compassionate leadership and the economy is coming back you know it's amazing to think after losing 22 million jobs at the height of this pandemic because of the solid foundation that our president poured in those first three years of less government less taxes more free and fair trade more american energy the american comeback has begun and from that 22 million loss we've already added 9.3 million jobs back to the american economy and we're just getting started we're opening up america again and we're opening up america's schools i'll get you back and i want to make you a promise and the governor knows we mean it as you in the grand canyon state and people all across the country continue to contend with this pandemic we will not rest we will not relent we will spare no expense and no effort until arizona and america put the coronavirus in the past and bring this state and nation back bigger and better than ever before we'll do it but to do that we all need to continue to do our part to bring america all the way back and to do that we also need four more years of president donald trump in the white house my fellow americans were passing through a time of testing but soon we will come to a time for choosing the choice in this election has never been clear and the stakes have never been higher it's really why i'm here today i want to talk about what's at stake i want to talk about the choice our nation faces i'm here to talk about faith in america and keeping faith with everything that's always made america good and great do families here in arizona and the lds community make no mistake about it our economic recovery is on the ballot but also there are things on the ballot more fundamental and more foundational to our country as well you know i think this coming election the choice is not going to be whether america will be more conservative or more liberal whether america will be more democrat or more republican more red or blue the choice in this election is whether america remains america it's whether we will leave to our children or grandchildren a country that's grounded in our highest ideals a freedom free markets and the inalienable right to life and liberty or whether we will leave to our children and grandchildren a country that's fundamentally transformed into something else no way are we going to let that happen i mean you get it we stand at a crossroads of freedom before us lie two paths one based on the dignity and worth of every individual and the other on the growing control of the state one road leads to greater freedom and opportunity for every american the other road leads to socialism and decline well i know the american people just as arizona did in 2016 are going to choose freedom and opportunity when we re-elect president donald trump for four more years joe biden and the radical democrats would set america on a path of socialism and decline make no mistake about it president trump set our nation on a path of freedom and opportunity from our very first day in office it's really amazing when you look at their agenda in the midst of a global pandemic joe biden would raise taxes by four trillion dollars by contrast president donald trump cut taxes across the board for the american people and we're going to keep delivering tax relief to working americans and businesses large and small joe biden would bury the economy under an avalanche of red tape more regulation more bureaucracy as i told you before this president's actually cut more federal red tape than any president in american history and we're just getting started and joe biden even has a two trillion dollar plan to abolish fossil fuels he'd rejoin the paris climate accord and implement his own version of the green new deal president trump has pursued an all of above energy strategy that's driving an american energy renaissance he's made our nation nearly energy independent for the first time in 75 years we're a net exporter of energy to the world and it's not just a choice at home it's a contrast of leadership on the world stage the american people need to remember that joe biden was a leading voice of appeasement toward iran and the iran nuclear deal president donald trump got us out of the iran nuclear deal and qasim salamani is gone and where four previous administrations made promises to the american people about our most cherished ally it was president donald trump who kept his promise when he moved the american embassy to jerusalem the capital of the state of israel so this president has stood with our allies and stood up to our enemies closer to home president donald trump has stood with the men and women of law enforcement every single day you know joe biden actually said that he believes america is in his words systemically racist and that law enforcement has again and i quote an implicit bias against minorities when joe biden was asked whether he would cut funding to law enforcement he said yes absolutely well president trump and i know what you all know the men and women who put on the uniform of law enforcement all across this country are the best people in america as i just told a gathering down in tucson of cops for trump with this president and this administration will always back the blue and we're not gonna defund the police not now not ever you know despite what joe biden and the radical left think the american people know law enforcement isn't the problem law enforcement is the solution we don't need to choose between supporting law enforcement and supporting our minority communities this president has done both every single day and we will continue to support law enforcement and support our minority communities with liberty and justice for all and on issues most important to people of faith across this country issues like life and religious liberty joe biden and the radical left are deeply out of step with the american people i'm proud to tell you though this president has stood for the religious freedom of every american of every faith every day of this administration it's true that's true as the president said not long ago we will never stop fighting for the sacred values that bind us together as americans he said we believe in the dignity of work and the sanctity of life we believe in faith and family not in government and bureaucracy and we live by the words of our national motto in god we trust so here at this inaugural event for latter-day saints for trump i want to assure all of you you have a president you have a vice president and an entire administration that understand that the greatness of america doesn't come from the corridors of government or even our bustling factories it comes from the character and faith of the american people that's why in one instance after another from the first day of this administration we've been defending freedom and defending the values that we all cherish every day i mean from the very first days of this administration president trump kept his word when he ended the enforcement of the johnson amendment and freed up pulpits all across america the freedom of speech will not end at the front door of your church or synagogue or place of worship ever again and where joe biden has actually promised to reimpose obamacare mandates on religious institutions president trump ended the assault on the little sisters of the poor two years ago and a few days back the supreme court ended it forever by a seven to two vote and then there was the peace cross in maryland it was literally constructed decades ago to honor fallen heroes in world war one but left-wing radical activists wanted to take it down president trump stepped in we stood strong we went to the supreme court and one more seven to two vote the peace cross is standing today and believe it or not under the last administration bibles were actually being removed from va hospital realms and even displays i heard about it a few years back there was a display on what's called a missing man table in the lobby of a va hospital in new hampshire and some liberal group sent a letter and said that you've got to take that army-issued bible off the table president trump said the bible stays and we issued a new policy not only allowing the state the display of bibles at va hospitals we made it sure that christmas carols and prayers and gatherings can happen in every va hospital in america we're going to defend the freedom of religion of all of our veterans of every faith [Music] and standing strong for religious liberty i'm proud to report to you that this president has already appointed more than 200 conservatives to our federal courts at every level and i can tell you they are all men and women who will uphold all the god-given liberties enshrined in our constitution like the freedom of religion the freedom of speech and the second amendment right to keep and bear arms 200 judges and none of that would have been possible without the strong consistent principled support of republicans in the united states senate and especially senator martha mcsally thank you for supporting conservatives to our courts at every level we've made so much progress over the last three and a half years strengthening the constitutional foundations of our federal courts but i'm going to have to tell all you gathered here that over the last month we've been reminded that we have work to do whether it was that 5-4 decision that struck down louisiana's pro-life law or whether it was the incomprehensible 5-4 decision that said that the churches could face greater restrictions than casinos one thing is clear we need more conservatives on the supreme court of the united states so we need four more years of president donald trump in the white house i mean that's exactly why this president announced not long ago what he announced four years ago come september we're going to release a list of principled conservative nominees that the president will draw any future nominee to the highest court in the land in the second term he kept his word before he'll keep his word again and if the opportunity presents itself in the next four years i promise you this president will appoint strong principled conservative men and women to the supreme court of the united states and beyond all of that while joe biden is advancing a social agenda of the radical left by contrast president donald trump is the most pro-life president in american history that's good that's true i mean from the first day of this administration this president our administration has stood without apology for the sanctity of life he was literally in office less than a week when he reinstituted what's known as the mexico city policy which ensures that no taxpayer dollars will ever be spent to provide or promote abortion abroad and one year later he expanded it by contrast joe biden and the radical left support abortion on demand they said they even support taxpayer funding of abortion i mean even though throughout his career joe biden supported what is known as the hyde amendment which has historically prevented your taxpayer dollars from being used to fund abortion with pressure from the radical left joe biden abandoned his historic position and now he's pledging to use taxpayer dollars to fund abortion at home and abroad and is calling for historic increases in funding to planned parenthood joe biden in the democratic party also support late-term abortion and democrats in the senate even blocked a bill that would require medical care for children that survive abortions contrast this president has consistently defended the vulnerable he's consistently defended the unborn he's consistently stood for the sanctity of life and we always will this president has called on congress out law late-term abortion once and for all and i must tell you it was one of the proudest moments for your vice president is the day that i had the privilege of sitting in the chair in the united states senate and being given the opportunity to cast the tie-breaking vote to allow states across the country to defund planned parenthood and president donald trump signed the bill into law so for all he's done for life and religious liberty here at this kickoff event of latter-day saints for trump for all he's done for people of faith of every faith across america men and women in arizona we need four more years of president donald trump in the white house it really is great to be with you today in fact it's a blessing the blessing to be able to be with you today to share this moment and to share this story you know and i i want to tell you i appreciate governor ducey's kind introduction but he's known me a little while he knows my values he knows the introduction i prefer is a little bit shorter i'm a christian a conservative and a republican in that order and i am honored to be with you today and that's why it's it means so much to me to be vice president to a president who's been such a steadfast defender of life and family and faith and freedom before i leave let me also just take this opportunity let me take this opportunity to just say thank you to all of you thank you for your support for your encouragement thank you for giving my little family the opportunity to serve you as vice president of the united states it's the greatest honor of my life yes all of you gathered here at latter-day saints for trump also know well the foundation of america is freedom but the foundation of freedom is faith as president john adams our first vice president said long ago and i quote our constitution was designed only for a moral and religious people it is wholly inadequate to the government of any other as i've traveled across this country over the last four years i'm more convinced than ever in my 61st year of two things that america is a freedom loving nation and america is a nation of faith people across this country know how precious freedom is i see i see the passion in this room i see it everywhere i go all across the country on street corners and conversations from sea to shining sea i mean i know we've got a tough fight ahead of us but it only means the prize is going to be more glorious and i hope you all see yourselves as a part of the great american story the story we're writing today is a story of promises made and promises kept it's a a story of renewing american strength it's a story of creating jobs renewing the american dream and opportunity for every american and in these challenging times it's a story of american character and resilience and faith law and order protecting all that's made this country strong and prosperous and good but like any unfinished story the rest is up to us from this day forward every day that remains between now and election day we've all got to do our part we've got to go tell the story and lay a foundation to write the next chapter we've got to tell all the wonderful families across this state and in this community about all the progress that we've made i mean tell them what we've done for life and liberty tell them what they're not hearing on most of their major cable television networks and tell them it's time it's time to write the next chapter of american greatness it's time to re-elect president donald trump for four more years so go tell them and this i know you will do because the american people have never stopped from those days when i was first added to this ticket the summer of 2016 and everyday since i've i've seen the way the american people reached out and took hold of their future you knew we could be strong again you knew we could be prosperous again you talked to your neighbors and your friends at work and at worship and we made history in 2016. and we're going to make history again in 2020. i know this because i have faith i have faith that this is a freedom-loving nation freedom beats in the heart of every american and i know the american people are going to choose freedom again and reject the radical left and joe biden and the pathway to socialism and decline i know we'll rise to the occasion we'll not only re-elect this president but we'll elect and re-elect principled conservatives at every level and i know you're going to step forward and do your part and i want to thank you in advance for all that you're going to do in these 83 days and if you're of a mine i'd ask you to do one more thing in every day that follows between now and when the polls close here in arizona as you're inclined to bow the head and bend the knee i'd encourage you to do that too we will the sweetest words that we ever hear as we travel around this country when people say i'm praying for you i've heard it today here in arizona and i hear it everywhere i go so does the president and i want to tell you we're we feel those prayers keep it up it matters but on this one i i'm not so much asking you to pray for a candidacy or pray for a cause i'm i just encourage you to pray for america pray for all of the american people the good book tells us that if his people who are called by his name will humble themselves and pray he'll do like he's always done in much more challenging times than we could possibly imagine he'll hear from heaven and he'll heal this land this one nation under god indivisible with liberty and justice for all so pray for america it'll make a difference for our nation and our future and as you pray pray with confidence we're also told that where the spirit of the lord is there's freedom that means when we make freedom our cause when we stand for freedom when we defend freedom when we live out freedom every day we make his work on this earth our own and that means freedom always wins so thank you for coming out to this extraordinary day and to all the latter-day saints for trump i say thank you for your support and i'll leave here today with confidence that with your continued support and prayers with these great conservatives re-elected to the house and senate and with four more years of president donald trump in the white house we're going to make america more prosperous than ever before we're going to make america safer than ever before we're going to heal our land and we're going to make america great again again thank you very much god bless you god bless arizona and god bless america,b applause to governor doug ducey who be just do a

PRON be whether PRON will leave to PRON child or grandchild a country that be ground in PRON high ideal a freedom free market and the inalienable right to life and liberty or whether PRON will leave to PRON child and grandchild a country that be fundamentally transform into something else no way be PRON go to let that happen i mean PRON get PRON PRON stand at a crossroad of freedom before PRON lie two path one base on the dignity and worth of every individual and the other on the grow control of the state one road lead to great freedom and opportunity for every american the other road lead to socialism and decline well i know the american people just as arizona do in be go to choose freedom and opportunity when PRON re elect president donald trump for four more year joe biden and the radical democrats would set america on a path of socialism and decline make no mistake about PRON president trump set PRON nation on a path of freedom and opportunity from PRON very first day in office PRON be really amazing when PRON look at PRON agenda in the midst of a global pandemic joe biden would raise taxis by four trillion dollar by contrast president donald trump cut taxis across the board for the american people and PRON be go to keep deliver tax relief to work americans and business large and small joe biden would bury the economy under an avalanche of red tape more regulation more bureaucracy as i tell PRON before this president actually cut more federal red tape than any president in american history and PRON be just get start and joe biden even have a two trillion dollar plan to abolish fossil fuel PRON would rejoin the paris climate accord and implement PRON own version of the green new deal president trump have pursue an all of above energy strategy that be drive an american energy renaissance PRON be make PRON nation nearly energy independent for the first time in year PRON be a net exporter of energy to the world and PRON be not just a choice at home PRON be a contrast of leadership on the world stage the american people need to remember that joe biden be a lead voice of appeasement toward iran and the iran nuclear deal president donald trump get PRON out of the iran nuclear deal and qasim salamani be go and where four previous administration make promise to the american people about PRON most cherished ally PRON be president donald trump who keep PRON promise when PRON move the american embassy to jerusalem the capital of the state of israel so this president have stand with PRON ally and stand up to PRON enemy closer to home president donald trump have stand with the man and woman of law enforcement every single day PRON know joe biden actually say that PRON believe america be in PRON word systemically racist and that law enforcement have again and i quote an implicit bias against minority when joe biden be ask whether PRON would cut funding to law enforcement PRON say yes absolutely well president trump and i know what PRON all know the man and woman who put on the uniform of law enforcement all across this country be the good people in america as i just tell a gathering down in tucson of cop for trump with

people know law enforcement be not the problem law enforcement be the solution PRON do not need to choose between support law enforcement and support PRON minority community this president have do both every single day and PRON will continue to support law enforcement and support PRON minority community with liberty and justice for all and on issue most important to people of faith across this country issue like life and religious liberty joe biden and the radical left be deeply out of step with the american people PRON be proud to tell PRON though this president have stand for the religious freedom of every american of every faith every day of this administration PRON be true that be true as the president say not long ago PRON will never stop fight for the sacred value that bind PRON together as americans PRON say PRON believe in the dignity of work and the sanctity of life PRON believe in faith and family not in government and bureaucracy and PRON live by the word of PRON national motto in god PRON trust so here at this inaugural event for latter day saint for trump i want to assure all of PRON PRON have a president PRON have a vice president and an entire administration that understand that the greatness of america do not come from the corridor of government or even PRON bustling factory PRON come from the character and faith of the american people that be why in one instance after another from the first day of this administration PRON have be defend freedom and defend the value that PRON all cherish every day i mean from the very first day of this administration president trump keep PRON word when PRON end the enforcement of the johnson amendment and free up pulpit all across america the freedom of speech will not end at the front door of PRON church or synagogue or place of worship ever again and where joe biden have actually promise to reimpose obamacare mandate on religious institution president trump end the assault on the little sister of the poor two year ago and a few day back the supreme court end PRON forever by a seven to two vote and then there be the peace cross in maryland PRON be literally construct decade ago to honor fallen hero in world war one but left wing radical activist want to take PRON down president trump step in PRON stand strong PRON go to the supreme court and one more seven to two vote the peace cross be stand today and believe PRON or not under the last administration bible be actually be remove from va hospital realm and even display i hear about PRON a few year back there be a display on what be call a miss man table in the lobby of a va hospital in new hampshire and some liberal group send a letter and say that PRON have get to take that army issue bible off the table president trump say the bible stay and PRON issue a new policy not only allow the state the display of bible at va hospital PRON make PRON sure that christmas carol and prayer and gathering can happen in every va hospital in america PRON be go to defend the freedom of religion of all of PRON veteran of every faith music and stand strong for religious liberty PRON be proud to report to PRON that this president have already appoint more than conservative to PRON federal court at every level and i can tell PRON PRON be all man and woman who will uphold all the god give liberty enshrine in PRON constitution like the freedom of religion the freedom of speech and the second amendment right to keep and bear arm judge and none of that would have be possible without the strong consistent principled support of republicans in the united states senate and especially senator martha mcsally thank PRON for support conservative to PRON court at every level PRON have make so much progress over the last three and a half year strengthen the constitutional foundation of PRON federal court but PRON be go to have to tell all PRON gather here that over the last month PRON have be remind that PRON have work to do

history-making combat veteran who's now defending freedom every day in the halls of the united states senate join me in thanking your current and future senator senator martha mcsally [Applause] or like a group of leaders who i can tell you firsthand have stood in the gap with our president and four conservative values every single day of this administration would you join me in thanking four amazing members of congress congresswoman debbie let's go congressman david schweikert congressman paul gosler and congressman andy biggs you know i served in the house of representatives for 12 years before i went home to be governor of indiana it was 12 years and i have to tell you it seemed longer but it is a remarkable thing when you see men and women who who carry the very same principles that carried them to washington d.c i have to tell you those that are gathered here arizona should be proud of the principled conservative delegation that you've sent to washington d.c they make a difference every day they really do it really is great to be with so many friends and speaking of friends allow me to bring greetings and gratitude from another friend of mine who loves the state of arizona and when i told him i was headed your way last night i think he sounded just a little bit jealous so allow me to bring greetings from a champion of life and liberty and the 45th president of the united states of america president donald trump it really is great to be with all of you today but i got to be honest with you i'm here for one reason and one reason only and that is that arizona and america need four more years of president donald trump in the white house you know four more years means more jobs four more years means more judges four more years means more support for our troops and it's going to take at least four more years to drain that swamp [Applause] you know i don't know if you all heard the news but on the way here i just heard that joe biden named his running mate california senator kamala harris will be the democrat candidate for vice president so let me take this opportunity to welcome her to the race i mean we all know look joe biden and the democratic party have been overtaken by the radical left so given their promises of higher taxes open borders socialized medicine and abortion on demand it's it's no surprise that he chose senator harris to be his running act you all might like to know that the vice presidential debate is going to be held on october 7th in utah so my message to the democratic candidate for vice president congratulations i'll see you in salt lake city [Applause] you know i remember the day that i got the call to join this ticket about four years ago this time karen and i had prayed all the way through it and i said yes in a heartbeat because i knew then that donald trump had the vision the leadership and the strength to make america great again and in four short years that's just what we've done i mean from the first day of this administration president trump has been working to keep the promises that he made to the people of arizona and people all across this country especially this president has worked every day i can attest to keep the promises that he has made to people of faith we've stood for the sanctity of life without apology we've stood for religious liberty of every american of every faith we've made the strongest military in the history of the world stronger still we've rebuilt our military and restored the arsenal of democracy you know i have to tell you as the proud father of a united states marine who's stationed right here in arizona and as the proud father-in-law of a united states navy pilot i couldn't be more proud to be vice president to a president who has so supported the men and women of our armed forces we're finally giving our soldiers sailors airmen marines and coast guard the resources and the support they need to accomplish their mission and defend this nation true and this president has also appointed more conservatives to our court of appeals than any president in american history in the midst of all of that in our first three years with the strong support of these conservatives in the congress we revived the american economy with less taxes less regulation more american energy and the kind of trade deals that put american jobs and american workers first amazing in those first three years this president kept all the promises that he made to the people of arizona and then some we cut those taxes across the board for working families and businesses large and small in fact this president signed more bills cutting federal red tape than any president in american history and the usmca is now the law of the land it's a win for america and a win for arizona we unleashed american energy and in the midst of all of that in those first three years american businesses created more than seven million good-paying jobs and then the coronavirus pandemic hit and it's been a challenging time especially especially over the last several months here in the state of arizona you know early in this pandemic the american people saw the leadership of president trump shine forth this president marshaled not only a whole of government response but a whole of america response we reinvented testing and now america has done more testing for the coronavirus than any nation on earth we arranged for the manufacturing delivery of hundreds of millions of medical supplies to all of the incredible health care workers and hospitals all across this country we've been working around the clock since february of this year developing medicines known as therapeutics at a record pace and i'm proud to say that we are well on our way to having the first coronavirus vaccine before the end of this year now we have a ways to go and we all have a role to play to protect the vulnerable to save lives and i know the people of arizona will continue to do that there's not a day gone by since the president tapped me to lead the white house coronavirus task force that i haven't thought of the families that have suffered loss today our hearts are with more than the more than 160 000 american families that have lost loved ones but our hearts are also filled with gratitude to the amazing first responders the amazing doctors nurses and health care workers who have been nothing less than heroic all through this pandemic and they have our thanks let me say to the people of arizona we're encouraged by the progress that you're making in the grand canyon state and the progress we're seeing all across the sun belt because of this president's leadership in all of our efforts because of the strong leadership here in the state of arizona in this challenging time i continue to receive reports that cases are coming down in arizona positive tests are coming down and the economy is coming back thank you governor doug ducey for your strong steady and compassionate leadership and the economy is coming back you know it's amazing to think after losing 22 million jobs at the height of this pandemic because of the solid foundation that our president poured in those first three years of less government less taxes more free and fair trade more american energy the american comeback has begun and from that 22 million loss we've already added 9.3 million jobs back to the american economy and we're just getting started we're opening up america again and we're opening up america's schools i'll get you back and i want to make you a promise and the governor knows we mean it as you in the grand canyon state and people all across the country continue to contend with this pandemic we will not rest we will not relent we will spare no expense and no effort until arizona and america put the coronavirus in the past and bring this state and nation back bigger and better than ever before we'll do it but to do that we all need to continue to do our part to bring america all the way back and to do that we also need four more years of president donald trump in the white house my fellow americans were passing through a time of testing but soon we will come to a time for choosing the choice in this election has never been clear and the stakes have never been higher it's really why i'm here today i want to talk about what's at stake i want to talk about the choice our nation faces i'm here to talk about faith in america and keeping faith with everything that's always made america good and great do families here in arizona and the lds community make no mistake about it our economic recovery is on the ballot but also there are things on the ballot more fundamental and more foundational to our country as well you know i think this coming election the choice is not going to be whether america will be more conservative or more liberal whether america will be more democrat or more republican more red or blue the choice in this election is whether america remains america it's whether we will leave to our children or grandchildren a country that's grounded in our highest ideals a freedom free markets and the inalienable right to life and liberty or whether we will leave to our children and grandchildren a country that's fundamentally transformed into something else no way are we going to let that happen i mean you get it we stand at a crossroads of freedom before us lie two paths one based on the dignity and worth of every individual and the other on the growing control of the state one road leads to greater freedom and opportunity for every american the other road leads to socialism and decline well i know the american people just as arizona did in 2016 are going to choose freedom and opportunity when we re-elect president donald trump for four more years joe biden and the radical democrats would set america on a path of socialism and decline make no mistake about it president trump set our nation on a path of freedom and opportunity from our very first day in office it's really amazing when you look at their agenda in the midst of a global pandemic joe biden would raise taxes by four trillion dollars by contrast president donald trump cut taxes across the board for the american people and we're going to keep delivering tax relief to working americans and businesses large and small joe biden would bury the economy under an avalanche of red tape more regulation more bureaucracy as i told you before this president's actually cut more federal red tape than any president in american history and we're just getting started and joe biden even has a two trillion dollar plan to abolish fossil fuels he'd rejoin the paris climate accord and implement his own version of the green new deal president trump has pursued an all of above energy strategy that's driving an american energy renaissance he's made our nation nearly energy independent for the first time in 75 years we're a net exporter of energy to the world and it's not just a choice at home it's a contrast of leadership on the world stage the american people need to remember that joe biden was a leading voice of appeasement toward iran and the iran nuclear deal president donald trump got us out of the iran nuclear deal and qasim salamani is gone and where four previous administrations made promises to the american people about our most cherished ally it was president donald trump who kept his promise when he moved the american embassy to jerusalem the capital of the state of israel so this president has stood with our allies and stood up to our enemies closer to home president donald trump has stood with the men and women of law enforcement every single day you know joe biden actually said that he believes america is in his words systemically racist and that law enforcement has again and i quote an implicit bias against minorities when joe biden was asked whether he would cut funding to law enforcement he said yes absolutely well president trump and i know what you all know the men and women who put on the uniform of law enforcement all across this country are the best people in america as i just told a gathering down in tucson of cops for trump with this president and this administration will always back the blue and we're not gonna defund the police not now not ever you know despite what joe biden and the radical left think the american people know law enforcement isn't the problem law enforcement is the solution we don't need to choose between supporting law enforcement and supporting our minority communities this president has done both every single day and we will continue to support law enforcement and support our minority communities with liberty and justice for all and on issues most important to people of faith across this country issues like life and religious liberty joe biden and the radical left are deeply out of step with the american people i'm proud to tell you though this president has stood for the religious freedom of every american of every faith every day of this administration it's true that's true as the president said not long ago we will never stop fighting for the sacred values that bind us together as americans he said we believe in the dignity of work and the sanctity of life we believe in faith and family not in government and bureaucracy and we live by the words of our national motto in god we trust so here at this inaugural event for latter-day saints for trump i want to assure all of you you have a president you have a vice president and an entire administration that understand that the greatness of america doesn't come from the corridors of government or even our bustling factories it comes from the character and faith of the american people that's why in one instance after another from the first day of this administration we've been defending freedom and defending the values that we all cherish every day i mean from the very first days of this administration president trump kept his word when he ended the enforcement of the johnson amendment and freed up pulpits all across america the freedom of speech will not end at the front door of your church or synagogue or place of worship ever again and where joe biden has actually promised to reimpose obamacare mandates on religious institutions president trump ended the assault on the little sisters of the poor two years ago and a few days back the supreme court ended it forever by a seven to two vote and then there was the peace cross in maryland it was literally constructed decades ago to honor fallen heroes in world war one but left-wing radical activists wanted to take it down president trump stepped in we stood strong we went to the supreme court and one more seven to two vote the peace cross is standing today and believe it or not under the last administration bibles were actually being removed from va hospital realms and even displays i heard about it a few years back there was a display on what's called a missing man table in the lobby of a va hospital in new hampshire and some liberal group sent a letter and said that you've got to take that army-issued bible off the table president trump said the bible stays and we issued a new policy not only allowing the state the display of bibles at va hospitals we made it sure that christmas carols and prayers and gatherings can happen in every va hospital in america we're going to defend the freedom of religion of all of our veterans of every faith [Music] and standing strong for religious liberty i'm proud to report to you that this president has already appointed more than 200 conservatives to our federal courts at every level and i can tell you they are all men and women who will uphold all the god-given liberties enshrined in our constitution like the freedom of religion the freedom of speech and the second amendment right to keep and bear arms 200 judges and none of that would have been possible without the strong consistent principled support of republicans in the united states senate and especially senator martha mcsally thank you for supporting conservatives to our courts at every level we've made so much progress over the last three and a half years strengthening the constitutional foundations of our federal courts but i'm going to have to tell all you gathered here that over the last month we've been reminded that we have work to do whether it was that 5-4 decision that struck down louisiana's pro-life law or whether it was the incomprehensible 5-4 decision that said that the churches could face greater restrictions than casinos one thing is clear we need more conservatives on the supreme court of the united states so we need four more years of president donald trump in the white house i mean that's exactly why this president announced not long ago what he announced four years ago come september we're going to release a list of principled conservative nominees that the president will draw any future nominee to the highest court in the land in the second term he kept his word before he'll keep his word again and if the opportunity presents itself in the next four years i promise you this president will appoint strong principled conservative men and women to the supreme court of the united states and beyond all of that while joe biden is advancing a social agenda of the radical left by contrast president donald trump is the most pro-life president in american history that's good that's true i mean from the first day of this administration this president our administration has stood without apology for the sanctity of life he was literally in office less than a week when he reinstituted what's known as the mexico city policy which ensures that no taxpayer dollars will ever be spent to provide or promote abortion abroad and one year later he expanded it by contrast joe biden and the radical left support abortion on demand they said they even support taxpayer funding of abortion i mean even though throughout his career joe biden supported what is known as the hyde amendment which has historically prevented your taxpayer dollars from being used to fund abortion with pressure from the radical left joe biden abandoned his historic position and now he's pledging to use taxpayer dollars to fund abortion at home and abroad and is calling for historic increases in funding to planned parenthood joe biden in the democratic party also support late-term abortion and democrats in the senate even blocked a bill that would require medical care for children that survive abortions contrast this president has consistently defended the vulnerable he's consistently defended the unborn he's consistently stood for the sanctity of life and we always will this president has called on congress out law late-term abortion once and for all and i must tell you it was one of the proudest moments for your vice president is the day that i had the privilege of sitting in the chair in the united states senate and being given the opportunity to cast the tie-breaking vote to allow states across the country to defund planned parenthood and president donald trump signed the bill into law so for all he's done for life and religious liberty here at this kickoff event of latter-day saints for trump for all he's done for people of faith of every faith across america men and women in arizona we need four more years of president donald trump in the white house it really is great to be with you today in fact it's a blessing the blessing to be able to be with you today to share this moment and to share this story you know and i i want to tell you i appreciate governor ducey's kind introduction but he's known me a little while he knows my values he knows the introduction i prefer is a little bit shorter i'm a christian a conservative and a republican in that order and i am honored to be with you today and that's why it's it means so much to me to be vice president to a president who's been such a steadfast defender of life and family and faith and freedom before i leave let me also just take this opportunity let me take this opportunity to just say thank you to all of you thank you for your support for your encouragement thank you for giving my little family the opportunity to serve you as vice president of the united states it's the greatest honor of my life yes all of you gathered here at latter-day saints for trump also know well the foundation of america is freedom but the foundation of freedom is faith as president john adams our first vice president said long ago and i quote our constitution was designed only for a moral and religious people it is wholly inadequate to the government of any other as i've traveled across this country over the last four years i'm more convinced than ever in my 61st year of two things that america is a freedom loving nation and america is a nation of faith people across this country know how precious freedom is i see i see the passion in this room i see it everywhere i go all across the country on street corners and conversations from sea to shining sea i mean i know we've got a tough fight ahead of us but it only means the prize is going to be more glorious and i hope you all see yourselves as a part of the great american story the story we're writing today is a story of promises made and promises kept it's a a story of renewing american strength it's a story of creating jobs renewing the american dream and opportunity for every american and in these challenging times it's a story of american character and resilience and faith law and order protecting all that's made this country strong and prosperous and good but like any unfinished story the rest is up to us from this day forward every day that remains between now and election day we've all got to do our part we've got to go tell the story and lay a foundation to write the next chapter we've got to tell all the wonderful families across this state and in this community about all the progress that we've made i mean tell them what we've done for life and liberty tell them what they're not hearing on most of their major cable television networks and tell them it's time it's time to write the next chapter of american greatness it's time to re-elect president donald trump for four more years so go tell them and this i know you will do because the american people have never stopped from those days when i was first added to

again you talked to your neighbors and your friends at work and at worship and we made history in 2016. and we're going to make history again in 2020. i know this because i have faith i have faith that this is a freedom-loving nation freedom beats in the heart of every american and i know the american people are going to choose freedom again and reject the radical left and joe biden and the pathway to socialism and decline i know we'll rise to the occasion we'll not only re-elect this president but we'll elect and re-elect principled conservatives at every level and i know you're going to step forward and do your part and i want to thank you in advance for all that you're going to do in these 83 days and if you're of a mine i'd ask you to do one more thing in every day that follows

around this country when people say i'm praying for you i've heard it today here in arizona and i hear it everywhere i go so does the president and i want to tell you we're we feel those prayers keep it up it matters but on this one i i'm not so much asking you to pray for a candidacy or pray for a cause i'm i just encourage you to pray for america pray for all of the american people the good book tells us that if his people who are called by his name will humble themselves and pray he'll do like he's always done in much more challenging times than we could possibly imagine he'll hear from heaven and he'll heal this land this one nation under god indivisible with liberty and justice for all so pray for america it'll make a difference for our nation and our future and as you pray pray with confidence we're also told that where the spirit of the lord is there's freedom that means when we make freedom our cause when we stand for freedom when we defend freedom when we live out freedom every day we make his work on this earth our own and that means freedom always wins so thank you for coming out to this extraordinary day and to all the latter-day saints for trump i say thank you for your support and i'll leave here today with confidence that with your continued support and prayers with these great conservatives re-elected to the house and senate and with four more years of president donald trump in the white house we're going to make america more prosperous than ever before we're going to make america safer than ever before we're going to heal our land and we're going

america and keep faith with everything that be always make america good and great do family here in arizona and the lds community make no mistake about PRON PRON economic recovery be on the ballot but also there be thing on the ballot more fundamental and more foundational to PRON country as well PRON know i think this come election the choice be not go to be whether america will be more conservative or more liberal whether america will be more democrat or more republican more red or blue the choice in this election be whether america remain america PRON be whether PRON will leave to PRON child or grandchild a country that be ground in PRON high ideal a freedom free market and the inalienable right to life and liberty or whether PRON will leave to PRON child and grandchild a country that be fundamentally transform into something else no way be PRON go to let that happen i mean PRON get PRON PRON stand at a crossroad of freedom before PRON lie two path one base on the dignity and worth of every individual and the other on the grow control of the state one road lead to great freedom and opportunity for every american the other road lead to socialism and decline well i know the american people just as arizona do in be go to choose freedom and opportunity when PRON re elect president donald trump for four more year joe biden and the radical democrats would set america on a path of socialism and decline make no mistake about PRON president trump set PRON nation on a path of freedom and opportunity from PRON very first day in office PRON be really amazing when PRON look at PRON agenda in the midst of a global pandemic joe biden would raise taxis by four trillion dollar by contrast president donald trump cut taxis across the board for the american people and PRON be go to keep deliver tax relief to work americans and business large and small joe biden would bury the economy under an avalanche of red tape more regulation more bureaucracy as i tell PRON before this president actually cut more federal red tape than any president in american history and PRON be just get start and joe biden even have a two trillion dollar plan to abolish fossil fuel PRON would rejoin the paris climate accord and implement PRON own version of the green new deal president trump have pursue an all of above energy strategy that be drive an american energy renaissance PRON be make PRON nation nearly energy independent for the first time in year PRON be a net exporter of energy to the world and PRON be not just a choice at home PRON be a contrast of leadership on the world stage the american people need to remember that joe biden be a lead voice of appeasement toward iran and the iran nuclear deal president donald trump get PRON out of the iran nuclear deal and qasim salamani be go and where four previous administration make promise to the american people about PRON most cherished ally PRON be president donald trump who keep PRON promise when PRON move the american embassy to jerusalem the capital of the state of israel so this president have stand with PRON ally and stand up to PRON enemy closer to home president donald trump have stand with the man and woman of law enforcement every single day PRON know joe biden actually say that PRON believe america be in PRON word systemically racist and that law enforcement have again and i quote an implicit bias against minority when joe biden be ask whether PRON would cut funding to law enforcement PRON say yes absolutely well president trump and i know what PRON all know the man and woman who put on the uniform of law enforcement all across this country be the good people in america as i just tell a gathering down in tucson of cop for trump with this president and this administration will always back the blue and PRON be not go to defund the police not now not ever PRON know despite what joe biden and the radical left think the american people know law enforcement be not the problem law enforcement be the solution PRON do not need to choose between support law enforcement and support PRON minority community this president have do both every single day and PRON will continue to support law enforcement and support PRON minority community with liberty and justice for all and on issue most important to people of faith across this country issue like life and religious liberty joe biden and the radical left be deeply out of step with the american people PRON be proud to tell PRON though this president have stand for the religious freedom of every american of every faith every day of this administration PRON be true that be true as the president say not long ago PRON will never stop fight for the sacred value that bind PRON together as americans PRON say PRON believe in the dignity of work and the sanctity of life PRON believe in faith and family not in government and bureaucracy and PRON live by the word of PRON national motto in god PRON trust so here at this inaugural event for latter day saint for trump i want to assure all of PRON PRON have a president PRON have a vice president and an entire administration that understand that the greatness of america do not come from the corridor of government or even PRON bustling factory PRON come from the character and faith of the american people that be why in one instance after another from the first day of this administration PRON have be defend freedom and defend the value that PRON all cherish every day i mean from the very first day of this administration president trump keep PRON word when PRON end the enforcement of the johnson amendment and free up pulpit all across america the freedom of speech will not end at the front door of PRON church or synagogue or place of worship ever again and where joe biden have actually promise to reimpose obamacare mandate on religious institution president trump end the assault on the little sister of the poor two year ago and a few day back the supreme court end PRON forever by a seven to two vote and then there be the peace cross in maryland PRON be literally construct decade ago to honor fallen hero in world war one but left wing radical activist want to take PRON down president trump step in PRON stand strong PRON go to the supreme court and one more seven to two vote the peace cross be stand today and believe PRON or not under the last administration bible be actually be remove from va hospital realm and even display i hear about PRON a few year back there be a display on what be call a miss man table in the lobby of a va hospital in new hampshire and some liberal group send a letter and say that PRON have get to take that army issue bible off the table president trump say the bible stay and PRON issue a new policy not only allow the state the display of bible at va hospital PRON make PRON sure that christmas carol and prayer and gathering can happen in every va hospital in america PRON be go to defend the freedom of religion of all of PRON veteran of every faith music and stand strong for religious liberty PRON be proud to report to PRON that this president have already appoint more than conservative to PRON federal court at every level and i can tell PRON PRON be all man and woman who will uphold all the god give liberty enshrine in PRON constitution like the freedom of religion the freedom of speech and the second amendment right to keep and bear arm judge and none of that would have be possible without the strong consistent principled support of republicans in the united states senate and especially senator martha mcsally thank PRON for support conservative to PRON court at every level PRON have make so much progress over the last three and a half year strengthen the constitutional foundation of PRON federal court but PRON be go to have to tell all PRON gather here that over the last month PRON have be remind that PRON have work to do whether PRON be that decision that strike down louisiana pro life law or whether PRON be the incomprehensible decision that say that the church could face great restriction than casino one thing be clear PRON need more conservative on the supreme court of the united states so PRON need four more year of president donald trump in the white house i mean that be exactly why this president announce not long ago what PRON announce four year ago come september PRON be go to release a list of principle conservative nominee that the president will draw any future nominee to the high court in the land in the second term PRON keep PRON word before PRON will keep PRON word again and if the opportunity present PRON in the next four year i promise PRON this president will appoint strong principle conservative man and woman to the supreme court of the united states and beyond all of that while joe biden be advance a social agenda of the radical left by contrast president donald trump be the most pro life president in american history that be good that be true i mean from the first day of this administration this president PRON administration have stand without apology for the sanctity of life PRON be literally in office less than a week when PRON reinstitute what be know as the mexico city policy which ensure that no taxpayer dollar will ever be spend to provide or promote abortion abroad and one year later PRON expand PRON by contrast joe biden and the radical left support abortion on demand PRON say PRON even support taxpayer funding of abortion i mean even though throughout PRON career joe biden support what be know as the hyde amendment which have historically prevent PRON taxpayer dollar from be use to fund abortion with pressure from the radical left joe biden abandon PRON historic position and now PRON be pledge to use taxpayer dollar to fund abortion at home and abroad and be call for historic increase in funding to plan parenthood joe biden in the democratic party also support late term abortion and democrats in the senate even block a bill that would require medical care for child that survive abortion contrast this president have consistently defend the vulnerable PRON be consistently defend the unborn PRON be consistently stand for the sanctity of life and PRON always will this president have call on congress out law late term abortion once and for all and i must tell PRON PRON be one of the proud moment for PRON vice president be the day that i have the privilege of sit in the chair in the united states senate and be give the opportunity to cast the tie

[Applause] and the road to victory runs right through wisconsin i mean look how far we've come because of the confidence that you placed in this president in our team four years ago we inherited a military hollowed out by devastating budget cuts an economy struggling to break out of the slowest recovery since the great depression terrorism was on the rise around the world and we witnessed a steady assault on our most cherished values and liberties but in three short years we rebuilt our military we revived our economy we cut taxes rolled back red tape unleashed american energy fraught for free and fair trade and the american economy came roaring back in those first three years wow and this president kept his promise we've appointed more than 200 judges to our federal courts at every level and i'm here to tell you they are all principled conservatives who will support the god-given liberties enshrined in our constitution like the freedom of religion the freedom of speech and the second amendment right to keep and bear arms and beyond all of those high ideals i couldn't be more proud to serve as vice president to a president who has stood without apology for the sanctity of human life [Applause] good so under president trump's leadership we've stood for security we've stood for our liberties we've stood for prosperity and our highest values and president donald trump has stood every day with the men and women who serve in law enforcement and we will stand with them for four more years you know the president and i know that the men and women who serve in law enforcement are some of the best people in this country they literally put their lives on the line every day they they count our lives more important than their own and those who serve in law enforcement deserve the respect of every american every day tragically this weekend we all witnessed more another round of attacks on those who wear the uniform two brave sheriff's deputies in los angeles were literally shot in cold blood while some stood on the street corner opposite of the incident and laughed and we're actually told that protesters gathered outside the hospital and chanted we hope they die you know one of those sheriff's deputies i learned is a mother of a six-year-old the other sheriff's deputies just 24 years old they were both on the job for less than a year i want to tell them and their families and all those who love and cherish our law enforcement that we are so glad to hear they are on the road to recovery they will remain in our hearts and in our prayers but i have to tell you you know the president and i will always support the right of americans to peaceful protest but rioting and looting is not peaceful protest burning businesses is not free speech bringing violence against innocent civilians or those in law enforcement must stop and it must stop now those who do such things will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law [Music] and you've seen this president's leadership up close not far from here when rioting and looting broke off broke out in kenosha wisconsin president trump sent in 200 federal law enforcement officers worked with your courageous state and local law enforcement and ended the violence in fact in fact over the last month we launched what's called operation legend literally we've deployed over a thousand federal law enforcement officials to our major cities that have been seeing violent protests and as we stand here today working with state and local law enforcement officials i'm proud to report they've made over 2 000 arrests of violent protesters all across the country we are going to have law and order in every city in every state in this country for every american of every race and creed and color so help us god you know for months all joe biden ever talked about was peaceful protesters as the american people watch businesses and communities in our major cities burn two weeks ago he did condemn violence in every form it takes but right after that he criticized law enforcement and joe biden has never called out his campaign staff or his running mate for raising money for bail for violent criminals and he still hasn't called on democrat mayors to get their cities under control you know the truth is joe biden would double down on all the policies that have led to violence in america cities i mean when you signal a lack of support or waning support for law enforcement it emboldens those it emboldens those who threaten our families and our cities so let me be clear we're going to stand with the men and women who serve on the thin blue line of law enforcement whether it's in los angeles or rochester or kenosha we are going to back the blue now joe biden joe biden says that america is systemically racist and that law enforcement in his words has a quote implicit bias against minorities when asked whether he'd support cutting funding to law enforcement joe biden actually replied quote yes absolutely but under this president this vice president in this administration i'll make your promise we're not gonna defund the police not now not ever president trump and i know what the people of wisconsin know we don't need to choose between supporting law enforcement and standing with our african-american neighbors or any of the minorities that live in our cities to improve the quality of their lives their education their jobs and their security from the first day of this administration we have stood with law enforcement we have expanded opportunities for african americans we have done both for three and a half years we're going to do both for four more years in the white house so in three short years we rebuild our military we revived our economy we stood for law and order and the results i can tell you having traveled to 30 countries around the world america is standing tall again we have a president who embraces his role as leader of the free world we have a president that doesn't apologize for america he stands for america and america is respected again our liberties are more secure and in those first three years it's also been about jobs jobs jobs it's amazing to think after we cut taxes rolled back regulation unleashed american energy and negotiated better trade deals businesses large and small created more than 7 million good-paying jobs all across this country and wages rose at their fastest pace in more than 10 years and what meant the most to the president of me was that wages rose most dramatically for hard-working blue collar americans the forgotten men and women of america were forgotten no more i mean we created the greatest economy in the world at the end of those first three years there were more americans working than ever before bottom line in three short years we made america great again we did and then the coronavirus struck from china and the people of wisconsin deserve to know that before the very first documented case of community transmission within our country president trump did what no other american president had ever done he suspended all travel from china he put the help of america first now joe biden uh called that xenophobic but the truth is i can tell you firsthand having led the white house coronavirus task force that action alone saved untold american lives and it bought us invaluable time to stand up the greatest national mobilization since world war ii at the president's direction we marshaled not only the full resources of the federal government but the full potential of the american economy we reinvented testing where we literally have done more testing than any nation in the world by a factor of five we're doing 800 000 tests a day we saw to the delivery of the manufacturer of billions of medical supplies to our doctors and nurses and hospitals and no american who required a ventilator was ever denied a ventilator in the united states of america now our hearts go out to all the families that have lost loved ones in the course of this pandemic and there's not a day gone by that those families haven't been in our hearts and in our prayers including the more than one thousand families here in the state of wisconsin but i'm proud to report to you that every single day we're developing new medicines that are saving lives across the country convalescent plasma rem deserve the innovation that we're seeing in the development of therapeutics and even though joe biden said and i quote no miracle is coming we are on track to have the first coronavirus vaccine before the end of this year america's in the miracle business i mean because of what we've all done together as a nation because of this president's leadership we've we're slowing the spread we're protecting the vulnerable we're saving lives and developing life-saving medicines and in the midst of this pandemic this president's also worked with leaders in the congress including congressman style and we secured more than four trillion dollars in support direct aid to american families and a paycheck protection program that saved 50 million american jobs it's true now we're going to continue to put the health of america first because of the strong foundation that we poured in those first three years and with the unprecedented aid that we were able to provide to families and businesses large and small after losing 22 million jobs at the height of this pandemic we've seen 10.6 million americans all ready go back to work including 200 000 people right here in wisconsin we're opening up america again and we're opening up america's schools [Applause] we're going to get there wisconsin we're going to get there together and i want to commend each and every one of you for the role that you've played in these challenging times and we've gone through a time of testing but as i like to say we're soon coming to a time for choosing 50 days from today the american people have a choice to make as president trump said in michigan just a couple of days ago and i quote at no time before has there been a clearer choice between the two parties two visions two philosophies two agendas for the future truth is joe biden has put forward the most extreme platform of any major party candidate in u.s history in the middle of a global pandemic joe biden wants to raise taxes by four trillion dollars your president we cut taxes across the board for working families and we're going to keep cutting taxes for four more years joe biden wants to bury our economy under an avalanche of red tape like his own version of the green new deal you know the only thing green about the green new deal is how much green it's going to cost all of us if they ever sign it into law this president he actually signed more laws cutting federal red tape than any president in american history already and we're going to keep chopping red tape to create jobs for four years to come you know when we took office china was literally half of our international trade deficit 500 billion dollars a year going to china in a trade deficit it's incredible but president trump made it clear that the era of economic surrender was over joe biden he's been a cheerleader for communist china throughout his career he actually wants to repeal all the tariffs that are leveling the playing field today for american workers i'll make you a promise president trump hasn't all just stood up to china we're going to keep standing up to china until they open their markets and put american workers on a level playing field because when american workers are on a level playing field we can win anywhere in the world [Music] true but it wasn't just our relationship with china you know joe biden was one of those folks who voted for nafta i don't have to tell neighbors here across the heartland about the impact nafta had 60 000 factories actually closed in the years since nafta was signed into law and when joe biden was vice president they did nothing to fix it nothing to take out the incentives that existed in nafta to move jobs south of our border but thanks to president trump's leadership nafta is history and the usmc is here to stay and you all in wisconsin know [Applause] i mean under the under the u.s mexico canada agreement canada is ending their unfair treatment of dairy farmers and we're actually expected to increase our dairy exports from here in wisconsin and all across the country by 300 million dollars a year a lot of milk but it's not just milk i mean usmca is actually expected to create 600 000 new jobs including fifty thousand manufacturing jobs i gotta tell you it's just amazing remember the last administration you had a president in the summer of 2016 who was asked about manufacturing jobs being lost in places like wisconsin and indiana and michigan and he said they were never coming back remember he said what magic wand do you have they'd lost 200 000 manufacturing jobs under the last administration well we didn't need a magic wand we just needed president donald trump in the white house 500 000 manufacturing jobs in our first three years that's all you need you know when it comes to trade when it comes to taxes regulation i'm telling you about you've got a president who always put american jobs and american workers first and where joe biden and the radical left want to crush american energy i mean part of what's fueling this american comeback we're experiencing today is low-cost energy for families and for businesses joe biden wants to raise the cost of electricity for every household every business in wisconsin this president he unleashed american energy and believe it or not we're now a net exporter of energy for the first time in 70 years low cost energy and energy independence that's the leadership of president donald trump and that's the choice the choice is clear whether it's security whether it's prosperity but it's also a clear choice when it comes to values and this president from very early on has stood strong for our most cherished liberties and president donald trump and our administration has stood for the religious freedom of every american of every faith and we always will you know the freedom of religion has been called our first freedom and even a casual study of the american founding will demonstrate you that people came to this country early on for many reasons but chief among them was the freedom of religion and that's the that's why this president took such strong steps early on he's the first president in american history to actually convene an international conference on religious liberty not once but twice he spoke at the united nations about our commitment to the freedom of religion he ended the enforcement of the johnson amendment so that pulpits around the country could be free to speak once again and president donald trump ended the assault on the little sisters of the poor and this year the supreme court made it permanent [Applause] i mean why that even had to happen i don't i don't get it you know i was an altar boy and i grew up in a wonderful catholic family i mean you've got a group of nuns that take a pledge of poverty to spend their entire lives helping the poor but when joe biden was vice president they became a target of the administration a target of obamacare mandates and believe it or not after the supreme court by a 7-2 vote said that president trump was right when we ended the assault on the little sisters of the poor joe biden actually said they're going to take it up again to impose those obamacare mandates back on the little sisters of the poor but we're not going to let it happen because we're going to re-elect president donald trump for four more years [Applause] [Music] [Applause] it has not just been about our religious liberty it's also been about an issue so near and dear to the hearts of tens of millions of americans in my little family in joe biden you have a candidate who actually supports taxpayer funding of abortion all the way up to the moment of birth it's extraordinary throughout his career joe biden was one of those democrats that said he supported abortion rights but he always voted for what's known as the hyde amendment which prevented the use of taxpayer dollars from being used to fund abortion but last year joe biden abandoned that and now he supports taxpayer funding of abortion and i couldn't be more proud to serve alongside a president who stands for the right to life and we always will you know joe biden is actually calling for historic increases in funding for the largest abortion provider in america planned parenthood and i got to tell you it was my privilege my privilege as president of the senate to cast the tie-breaking vote that would allow states across america to defund planned parenthood and president donald trump signed it into law you know when you look at their agenda in detail which they didn't talk about much at their national convention did you notice that if you look at it in detail i wouldn't want to talk about it either but men and women across wisconsin we got to talk about it in the next 50 days i mean the truth is when you look at that agenda you can see that joe biden would be nothing more than a trojan horse for the radical left i mean the choice in this election has never been clear and the stakes have never been higher joe biden said in his convention that democracy was on the ballot well i think our economic recovery is on the ballot law and order are on the ballot i mean i also believe that there are things more foundational to our country that are on the ballot as well i've said it before i'll say it again in this election i think 50 days from now it's not going to be so much whether america ends up more conservative or more liberal more republican or more democrat more red or more blue i think the choice in this election is whether america remains america so we've got to decide right here and right now that we are going to fight to leave our children and grandchildren a country grounded in our highest ideals freedom free markets the unalienable right to life and liberty i mean we stand we stand at a crossroads in a very real sense you know my wife uh my wife loves poetry robert frost is her favorite poet and the poem she likes the most is the one that talks about two roads diverged in a woods it says two roads diverged in the woods and i i took the road less traveled by and it's made all the difference the american people have always taken the road less traveled by throat of more freedom more personal responsibility a boundless opportunity we've got to make sure in 50 days that we choose that road again we've got to decide right here and right now that joe biden will never be president of the united states we're going to re-elect president donald trump for four more years the stakes are that high and the opportunity is that great the president was talking about all our plans at our national convention and just a couple days ago in michigan you know four more years means more jobs four more years means more judges four more years means more support for our police more support for our troops and it's going to take at least four more years to drain that swab so it's on wisconsin 50 days and counting now it really is great being with all of you thank you for coming out thanks for coming out on a monday morning it really it's very humbling for me [Applause] and while i got you can i just say thank you for the privilege of serving as your vice president it's the greatest honor but now we have work to do now we have work to do because i want to be your vice president for four more [Applause] years you know it was interesting a little more than four years ago i'd only met our president a couple of times it's true didn't know each other very well before he called me to ask me to join this ticket and um we've gotten to be very close over the last four years and some people think we're kind of different but i got to tell you i got to tell you seeing him when the cameras are off i'll tell you straight from my heart president donald trump has never stopped fighting to keep the promises that he made to the people of wisconsin he has fought for you every day and now it's our turn to fight for him so i encourage you i got a plane to catch i'm actually going to montana today and sadly there's not a horse in my future but it's really been great being with you today i want to encourage you to get out and tell the story i want to i want you to you know say i was in janesville the other day i ran into mike early on a monday morning that guy seemed so fired up about everything that we have done for america and he said we're just getting started that's why we need four more years of president donald trump in the white house you got to go tell him tell your neighbors and friends and when you do and when you do you know when you get out there and talk to your neighbors and your friends at work at worship you know across a backyard fence just she just tapped her watch and said i want to get out there she said let's go yeah thank you thank you yeah she said wear your heart on your sleeve let people see your heart and see the difference that you know this president's made in the country that's a beautiful line thank you so much but just tell them what we've done tell them what the stakes are tell them what the stakes are i think choice has never been clearer and the stakes have never been higher and just when you go out just have have faith have faith in your neighbors and friends to be able to see through the onslaught the constant attacks that come from the other side and their allies in the media to see through to to know everything this president has done for this country and everything that we have yet to do i mean the american people saw through it in 2016 and i know they're going to see through it on november 3rd 2020. and lastly i'd encourage you to have that other kind of faith too you know it seems like if you turn on the television these days that there's there's more than divides us in these united states than ever before but i'll always believe that there's there's always been more that unites us across this country than could ever divide us and chief among those things is our faith this is a nation of faith and so i just say if if you're inclined like the pence's to bow the head and bend the knee i'd encourage you to do that too over the next 50 days and on this one i i'm not so much asking that you pray for a candidate or for a cause as much as you just pray for our country pray for all the american people because i'll always believe those ancient words that if his people who are called by his name will humble themselves and pray he'll do like he's always done through much more challenging times even than we face today he'll hear from heaven and he'll heal this land this one nation under god indivisible with liberty and justice for all so pray for america and if you all do that i know that with your continued support with your voice with you she said it you wear that passion wear that red hat and wear that love for all that we've done together on your sleeve between now and november 3rd we're going to lead a great american comeback we're going to make wisconsin and america stronger and more prosperous than ever before we're going to make it safer more secure than ever before and with president donald trump in the white house for four more years and congressman brian style in a new republican majority in the congress of the united states and with god's help we

when american worker be on a level playing field PRON can win anywhere in the world music true but PRON be not just PRON relationship with china PRON know joe biden be one of those folk who vote for nafta i do not have to tell neighbor here across the heartland about the impact nafta have factory actually close in the year since nafta be sign into law and when joe biden be vice president PRON do

need president donald trump in the white house manufacture job in PRON first three year that be all PRON need PRON know when PRON come to trade when PRON come to taxis regulation PRON be tell PRON about PRON have get a president who always put american job and american worker first and where joe biden and the radical left want to crush american energy i mean part of what be fuel this american comeback PRON be experience today be low cost energy for family and for business joe biden want to raise the cost of electricity for every household every business in wisconsin this president PRON unleash american energy and believe PRON or not PRON be now a net exporter of energy for the first time in year low cost energy and energy independence that be the leadership of president donald trump and that be the choice the choice be clear whether PRON be security whether PRON be prosperity but PRON be also a clear choice when PRON come to value and this president from very early on have stand strong for PRON most cherished liberty and president donald trump and PRON administration have stand for the religious freedom of every american of every faith and PRON always will PRON know the freedom of religion have be call PRON first freedom and even a casual study of the american founding will demonstrate PRON that people come to this country early on for many reason but chief among PRON be the freedom of religion and that be the that be why this president take such strong step early on PRON be the first president in american history to actually convene an international conference on religious liberty not once but twice PRON speak at the united nations about PRON commitment to the freedom of religion PRON end the enforcement of the johnson amendment so that pulpit around the country could be free to speak once again and president donald trump end the assault on the little sister of the poor and this year the supreme court make PRON permanent applause i mean why that even have to happen i do not i do not get PRON PRON know i be an altar boy and i grow up in a wonderful catholic family i mean PRON have get a group of nun that take a pledge of poverty to spend PRON entire life help the poor but when joe biden be vice president PRON become a target of the administration a target of obamacare mandate and believe PRON or not after the supreme court by a vote say that president trump be right when PRON end the assault on the little sister of the poor joe biden actually say PRON be go to take PRON up again to impose those obamacare mandate back on the little sister of the poor but PRON be not go to let PRON happen because PRON be go to re elect president donald trump for four more year applause music applause PRON have not just be about PRON religious liberty PRON be also be about an issue so near and dear to the heart of ten of million of americans in PRON little family in joe biden PRON have a candidate who actually support taxpayer funding of abortion all the way up to the moment of birth PRON be extraordinary throughout PRON career joe biden be one of those democrats that say PRON support abortion right but PRON always vote for what be know as the hyde amendment which prevent the use of taxpayer dollar from be use to fund abortion but last year joe biden abandon that and now PRON support taxpayer funding of abortion and i could not be more proud to serve alongside a president who stand for the right to life and PRON always will PRON know joe biden be actually call for historic increase in funding for the large abortion provider in america plan parenthood and i get to tell PRON PRON be PRON privilege PRON privilege as president of the senate to cast the tie break vote that would allow state across america to defund planned parenthood and president donald trump sign PRON into law PRON know when PRON look at PRON agenda in detail which PRON do not talk about much at PRON national convention do PRON notice that if PRON look at PRON in detail i would not want to talk about PRON either but man and woman across wisconsin PRON get to talk about PRON in the next day i mean the truth be when PRON look at that agenda PRON can see that joe biden would be nothing more than a trojan horse for the radical left i mean the choice in this election have never be clear and the stake have never be high joe biden say in PRON convention that democracy be on the ballot well i think PRON economic recovery be on the ballot law and order be on the ballot i mean i also believe that there be thing more foundational to PRON country that be on the ballot as well PRON have say PRON before PRON will say PRON again in this election i think day from now PRON be not go to be so much whether america end up more conservative or more liberal more republican or more democrat more red or more blue i think the choice in this election be whether america remain america so PRON have get to decide right here and right now that PRON be go to fight to leave PRON child and grandchild a country ground in PRON high ideal freedom free market the unalienable right to life and liberty i mean PRON stand PRON stand at a crossroad in a very real sense PRON know PRON wife uh PRON wife love poetry robert frost be PRON favorite poet and the poem PRON like the most be the one that talk about two road diverge in a wood PRON say two road diverge in the wood and i i take the road less travel by and PRON be make all the difference the american people have always take the road less travel by throat of more freedom more personal responsibility a boundless opportunity PRON have get to make sure in day that PRON choose that road again PRON have get to decide right here and right now that joe biden will never be president of the united states PRON be go to re elect president donald trump for four more year the stake be that high and the opportunity be that great the president be talk about all PRON plan at PRON national convention and just a couple day ago in michigan PRON know four more year mean more job four more year mean more judge four more year mean more support for PRON police more support for PRON troop and PRON be go to take at least four more year to drain that swab so PRON be on wisconsin day and count now PRON really be great be with all of PRON thank PRON for come out thank for come out on a monday

Aot Senate leader Chuck Morris Trump campaign co chairs representative
Fred Do set and future state Senator Lou Gare. Djalo, New Hampshire Republican Party Chairman
Steve Stepanek All the veterans who are with us today
candidates, my fellow Americans. It is great to be back and live free or die
country. And I gotta tell you to be here in the
Granite State just 42 days away from another great
victory for the American people. Win New Hampshire and America vote for four
mawr years of President Donald Trump in the White House on. Yeah, I got to tell you, I know he was just
here in New Hampshire a little bit ago, but when I talked to him this morning
and told him I was headed back to the Granite State, I think he sounded just
a little bit jealous because I got to tell you, you have a
president and a vice president who know it all started here in the first in the
nation primary state and the road to victory goes straight
through New Hampshire. But thank you all for coming out today.
It's a beautiful day and great to be with so many friends, and I'm
especially grateful to be here with a successful businessman. I love you, too,
Dog on. Especially great to be here with a
successful businessman. He left home when he was 17 years old, went over the West Point, became an
Army ranger, served with distinction in uniform. He came home, studied the law,
and now he's founded a firm that employs more than 300 people in nine
cities. And now he has stepped up to represent the state of New Hampshire in
Washington, D. C. Would you join me in thanking the next great senator from
the state of New Hampshire? Korkie Messner. Yeah, let's start. What a great guy. I'm also proud to be
joined by two other future leaders who are with us today. The first Congressional District is a
man who served as a senior adviser in this administration in the White House,
the State Department. I'm telling you what he was also a trusted adviser in
that historic campaign. In 2016 he is a man of principle, great caliber, who
will stand for all of our God given liberties in the Constitution of the
United States. And in the second District, you've got
a retired Army Air Force officer. Excuse me from a military family who
founded a veteran owned business in National. He's gonna be a great voice
for our national defense. Let me tell you, New Hampshire and America need you
descend Matt Mauer's and Steve Negrin to the United States House of
Representative, and we need him there in a new
Republican majority. Thank you guys. Two great men, two great candidates,
and it's an honor to be with them and to be with you. Korky. It's great to be
here, though, Folks. It's amazing to think here, in this first in the nation
primary state, you knew that America could be strong
again. You knew that America could be prosperous again. A movement that began
in this state has continued, brought our country to all new heights and
brought us through challenging times. So many of you said yes to President
Donald Trump in 2016. But I'm here 42 days from Election Day because I know
New Hampshire is going to say yes to four more years of President Donald
Trump in the White House. You know, on its because of what we've all done
together. It's incredible. Four years ago, we inherited a military that have
been hollowed out my budget cuts an economy that was struggling to break
out of the slowest recovery since the Great Depression. Terrorism was on the
march around the world, and we witnessed a steady assault on our most
cherished values. But in three short years, we rebuild our military way, restored the arsenal of democracy.
And I got to tell you, as the father of the United States Marine and the father
in law of a Navy pilot, I couldn't be more proud to be vice president for a
president who stands so strong for the men and women of our armed forces on
their family. Andare veteran. Yeah, so it wasn't just our national defense.
This president also revived our economy. We cut taxes across the board for
working families, small businesses and family farms. We rolled back more
federal red tape in the last 3.5 years than any administration in American
history. We unleashed American energy, fought for free and fair trade, and in
just three short years, businesses large and small created more than seven
million good paying jobs, including 19,000 jobs right here in the Granite
State. Yeah, in those first three years, wages were
rising at their fastest pace in more than 10 years, and they were rising
most rapidly for hard working blue collar Americans. In the midst of all
of that, more security, more prosperity. President Donald Trump has stood
without apology for the sanctity of human life. Yeah, we've stood for life, and we've stood
for all our liberties. So I stand before you today. This president has
also seen more than 200 federal judges confirmed to our federal courts at
every level. And I can tell you they are all principled conservatives who
will support the God given liberties enshrined in our Constitution, like the
freedom of religion, the freedom of speech and the Second Amendment right
to keep in bear arms principal judges like Justice Neil
Gorsuch and Justice Brett Kavanaugh. And let me take a minute. Let me take a
minute to thank Ah, former attorney general and your former senator who
played a critical role in seeing our first nominee confirmed she was there
at Justice Neil Gorsuch side every step of the way in our first year in office.
Join me in thanking former Senator Kelly Ayotte for a great job for
America. Thank you, Senator. Senator, A yacht was their toe work
with members of the Senate when there was an opening in the United States
Supreme Court and history records the difference that it's made. But we've come to another such time,
haven't we? And let me say, Justice Ruth Bader
Ginsburg lived in inspiring life. She paved the way for women in the law, and
America mourns the passing of a true public service. The Constitution of the United States
provides that the President shall appoint judges to the Supreme Court. Yeah, and before the week is out after we
honor the life in memory of Justice Ginsburg, President Donald Trump will
do just that. Yeah. This Saturday this Saturday, President Donald Trump
will nominate another principled conservative, a woman to the Supreme
Court of the United States. And after the United States Senate fulfills their
duty to advise and consent, we're gonna fill that seat. No, we're gonna fill that seat, and we're gonna do it. We're gonna do
it in election year, I promise you, you know, it's amazing to think since
George Washington all the way through Barack Obama, they've been 29 vacancies
during an election year on the Supreme Court of the United States. And on 29 occasions the president
nominated a judge to fill the seat on the Supreme Court. President Trump is
going to do his duty, and we're gonna have one mawr strong conservative on
the highest court in the way. So our president has stood for a strong
national defense, less taxes, less regulation free and fair trade. We've
stood every day for the rule of law, appointing judges at every level of our
federal courts. A zai stand before you today, I can tell you firsthand, President
Donald Trump has stood every day with the men and women who serve in law
enforcement all across America. And we are going to stand with them for four
Mawr years. Okay? Yeah. Now, President Trump and I know the men
and women of law enforcement or some of the best people in this country. They put their lives on the line every
single day. They literally count our lives more
important than their own. And those who serve on the thin blue
line of law enforcement deserve the respect of every American every single
day. But it's been it's been an
extraordinary time through which were living isn't just In the last few weeks
alone, we've seen even Maura tax on our heroes in uniform. Last week, two
gunmen attacked the home of two New Jersey police officers and their 10 day
old little girl. Investigators reported that the gunman
pulled up to the front of their home and fired six rounds into the house,
two bullets pierced through the front door by the grace of God. Thankfully,
neither the couple nor their newborn baby were injured. But that attack followed just a a
couple of days after to Los Angeles, sheriff's deputies were shot literally
in cold blood. They sat on patrol in their squad car.
You all saw the video, and I know you also saw the video of of someone standing across the street
having seen the shooting, literally laughing and then people going to the hospital,
blocking the way to the emergency room and and chanting We hope they die, Men and women of New Hampshire the attacks and disrespect of law
enforcement must stop, and it must stop now, person. Now, President Trump and I will always
support the right of Americans to peaceful protests. But rioting and
looting is not peaceful. Protest burning businesses is not free speech threatening or engaging in violence
against innocents. Civilians or those in law enforcement will not be
tolerated in those who do so will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the
law thing we're not gonna have. That's why, in our first three years
I'm proud to report our president secured funding for more than 4000 more
police officers on the streets of this country through the cops program. And
in the wake of this summer's violence in major cities around America,
President Trump took action. We launched Operation Legend. We deployed
more than 1000 federal law enforcement officers toe work hand in glove with
with county and state and local law enforcement in the cities that have
been infected. And I have to tell you we've already seen the arrest of more
than 2500 violent protesters in cities across America. Way are going toe, have
law and order in every city in every state, in America, for every American,
of every race and creed and color. So help us God now. For months, all Joe Biden never
talked about was peaceful protesters. Remember, as the American people literally watch
businesses and communities burn a few weeks back, he did. I think he
went to Pittsburgh where the president's headed today, and he said, and I quote violence, he
said. He condemned violence in all of forms it takes, but right after that he
criticized law enforcement, and Joe Biden has never called out his
campaign staff or his running mate for raising money to bail out violent
criminals. And Joe Biden has still never called on Democrat mayors to get
their cities under control and back the police. You know, the truth is, Joe Biden would
double down on the policies that have led to violence in America. And Joe Biden says that America is
systemically racist and that law enforcement has, in his
words, an implicit bias against minorities. When asked whether he'd support cutting
funding, the law enforcement, Joe Biden replied, Yes, absolutely. But I'll make you promise under President Donald Trump, we're
going to stand with those who stand on the thin blue line. We're gonna back
the blue, and we're not going to defund the police. Not now, not ever s. You know, the people of New Hampshire.
No. We don't have to choose between supporting law enforcement and standing
with our African American neighbors and families and minorities in our major
cities. I mean, from the first day of this administration, we've We've been
standing with the men and women on the thin blue line, and we've been
expanding educational opportunities and economic and job opportunities and
public safety for all of the families in our major cities, the men and women.
I'll tell you what, we're going to keep standing with law enforcement. We're
gonna keep standing with our African American neighbors, and we're gonna
keep standing for four more years. E Yeah. So if you're taking notes, we rebuild
our military, you revive the economy. We stood for life and liberties and law
and order. Korkie, you at all. The truth is, in the first three years
we created the greatest economy in the world. America's respected again. Our
liberties were more secure in the constitutional foundation of our nation,
was strengthened and word those first three years we made America great again. Yeah, it's just amazing what we accomplished
together in the first three years and then 2020 arrived and the coronavirus struck from China. But I could tell you, before the first
documented case of community transmission within the United States,
President Trump demonstrated leadership by doing what no American president has
ever done in history. When he suspended all travel from China, he put the
health of America first. Now Joe Biden said it with that. That
decision was hysterical and xenophobic. But I can tell you, having led the
White House Coronavirus Task Force since late February, that action saved
untold American lives. And it bought us invaluable time to stand up the
greatest national mobilization since World War two. A lot of people to may right when you
think of what America has accomplished. Before the end of January, we actually
started the process of developing a vaccine. We reinvented testing. In just
a couple days ago, we cleared. We've done 100 million tests farm or than any
other nation on Earth. By far we saw in the manufacturing and delivery of
hundreds of million's of medical supplies across the country and working
with manufacturers across the Heartland of this nation. We built ventilators,
and no American who ever required a ventilator was ever denied a ventilator
in the United States. Incredible. As we stand here today, we're
developing new medicines, but we're saving lives every day, and I'm proud
to report to you that we are on track to have the first safe and effective
coronavirus vaccine before the end of this year. We're slowing the spread. We're
protecting the vulnerable. We're saving lives and developing lifesaving
medicines. And that's testament to the strength and resilience of the people
of this country and the people of this great state. It's also a testament to the incredible
commitment of our doctors and nurses and health
care workers and first responders who deserve the admiration of every
American you have are you hear that the progress we've made over this
challenging time is a testament to the American people, the testament to your
president and the leadership marshaled at the national level. But it's also a
testament to the partnership that we forge with states all across the
country. And let me just take a moment to say It's also a tribute to the
strong and consistent and compassionate leadership of Governor Chris Sununu. He's led this state through a
challenging time, and he has a family in the midst of this pandemic. We've come to, Ah, my heart breaking
moment. It's a heartbreaking milestone, and I want to say There's not a day
gone by that I haven't thought of families that have lost loved ones in
the midst of this panda. I know that you've always been in our
hearts and you'll remain in our prayers. But I truly do believe because of what
we've all done together, because of the president's early action putting the
health of America first because of what our first responders and doctors and
nurses have done all along the way, and because of the compassion and care and
cooperation of the American people. I know in my heart that we have saved
hundreds of thousands of American lives in the midst of this pandemic. We've
also focused on the impact on families. Early on, President Trump made it clear
we were gonna do whatever it took to get families and businesses through
this challenging time. We worked with leaders in Congress in both parties
secured more than $4 trillion in direct support to American families. And we
created a paycheck protection program that saved 50 million American jobs. Yeah, so we're going to continue to put the
health of America first. We're going to continue to put the
health of America first, I promise you, until we reach that day that we have
that vaccine and we put this coronavirus in the past. But I'm proud
to report to you because of that strong foundation we poured in our first three
years because of the unprecedented aid that the president was able to secure
for families and businesses after losing 22 million jobs at the height of
this pandemic, we've already seen 10.6 million Americans go back to work,
including 59,000 Americans right here in New Hampshire. In this state alone in the month of May,
there was a 17% unemployment rate, but the governor just told me a little bit
ago. New Hampshire, 5.1% unemployment way are opening up America again, and
we're opening up American schools. So the choice in this election has
never been clear. The stakes have never been higher. I'm grateful that you all came out
today so we could talk about that choice because I need you to leave here today,
and I need you to talk about the choice people are facing here in New Hampshire.
We came really close in 2016 in the Granite State. But I know the people of New Hampshire
take it back where you where you believe that you live free or die.
We're going to stand for freedom. We're going to deliver New Hampshire for four
more years for President Donald Trump. But you've got to get out and tell the
story. I don't know what you're talking about on. Here's the choice. Here's the church. I mean, it's amazing
to think in the middle of a global pandemic. Joe Biden wants to raise
taxes by $4 trillion. President Trump. We cut taxes across
the board for working families and businesses, and we're going to keep
cutting taxes for four more years. That's the choice. Joe Biden wants to bury our economy
under an avalanche of red tape. He's got his own version of the green New
Deal. President Trump. We actually signed
Mawr laws cutting federal red tape than any administration in history. And
we're gonna keep on chopping for four more years. No. Joe Biden is for open borders,
sanctuary cities, free lawyers and health care for illegal immigrants.
President Donald Trump made record investments in our border security.
Mexico's doing mawr to secure our border, and there's than ever before,
and we've already built 300 miles of that border wall on the southern border
of the United States. On with four more years. We're gonna build it all. And when it comes to jobs and trade
contrast couldn't be more clear. Joe Biden supported NAFTA. Not going to
tell you out in the Heartland. We we saw the impact of that trade deal. He
never lifted a finger to reform it or to re negotiate it. But
thanks to President Trump, the man who wrote the art of the deal, Americans
got a better deal. NAFTA is gone. The USMC A is here. It's a huge win for New
Hampshire, you know, when we came into office,
half of our international trade deficit was with one country People's Republic of China. I mean $500 billion a year lost in a
trade deficit. For decades, Joe Biden has been a cheerleader for communist
China President Trump. He put China on notice from Day one and
said the era of economic surrender is over. A little over a week from early on, our president used his
authority. We impose tariffs on China. We stood strong for American private
property. You know, Joe Biden actually wants to repeal all of the tariffs
President Trump put into effect that air leveling the playing field for
American workers. But I'll make your promise. President
Donald Trump is going to continue to stand strong against China's trade
abuses were going to put American jobs and American workers first until China
opens their markets and respects private property of Americans. So it's been about security and
prosperity, but it's also been about our values. It's amazing to think. Throughout his career, Joe Biden was
one of those Democrats that said while he supported abortion rights, he didn't
support taxpayer funding of abortion. He voted consistently for what's known
as the Hide Amendment that prevented taxpayer dollars from being used here,
a home for abortion. But it's about a year ago, Joe Biden abandoned his historic
opposition a taxpayer funding of abortion. And now Joe Biden supports
taxpayer funding of abortion all the way up to the moment of birth. Well, President Donald Trump has stood
strong for the Hyde amendment. We'll stand
strong to oppose taxpayer funding of abortion at home or abroad. And
President Donald Trump will be the most pro life president in American history
for four more years. And we all know you know Joe Biden.
They keep asking him toe publish his list of judges that he'd appoint to the
courts. I saw him give a speech this weekend where you say you're not gonna
do it this week. I mean, we all know Joe
Biden would appoint activist judges to the court to legislate from the bench. And this president, This president, as
I said before, is appointed Mawr conservatives to our Court of Appeals
than any president in American history. And we're gonna keep on appointing
strong, principled conservatives from the Supreme Court toe all of our
federal court, therefore more President Trump, for his part, just
released a list the new list, just like he did in 2016 he told the American
people there were openings on the Supreme Court he draw from that list.
And I was there every step of the way. When he did just that, he kept his word.
And he'll do it again when we feel that city. What? So I want to thank you all for coming
out today. I really do. I hope you can hear. I hope you can hear how clear
this choices. I hope you all can see how clear this
choice is minimum. I mean the truth. The matter is the truth. The matter is
that we got 42 days to keep America headed on the right track. Yeah,
because we know what they'll do. I mean, they're driving toe, not only hold the
house, but they're trying to win the Senate. And when the White House, I
said before, the stakes have never been higher, the choice has never been clear. Now, Joe Biden and his national
convention said that democracy is on the ballot. Remember that. Now I can tell you, I think our
economic recovery is on the ballot. I mean, think about it. As our economy
is standing back up after the worst pandemic in 100 years to strike our
nation. I mean, who do you want in the White
House? Someone who presided over the slowest economic recovery since the
Great Depression, or a proven job creator in the White House for four
more years, our economic recoveries on the baths? Yeah, Joe Biden says, democracy is on the
ballot, but I think law and orders on the ballot as well. But, you know, before I leave you, I do want
to tell you I I actually think that there are things more foundational to
this country that are on the ballot as well. You know, when the dust settles in this
election, I think it's not gonna be a matter of
whether we're as a nation mawr Republican or more Democratic. Whether
we're more liberal or more conservative, more read or more blue, I think the choice in this election
whether America remains America, it's whether we're gonna chart a course for our Children and grandchildren that
is grounded in our highest ideals of freedom and free markets and
personal responsibility and individual liberty, or whether we're going to take that
hard left turn. The Joe Biden and the radical left
would have us take down bye so I gotta tell you, New Hampshire, we
got to decide right here. And right now that Joe Biden will never be president
of the United States. We're going to re elect President Donald Trump for four
more years off the idea. I mean, I gotta tell you, it really is
great to be here at the Laconia Municipal Airport. And I have landed my plane here, but we
needed just a little bit more runway. But I'm grateful that you came out. But,
you know, I got I got to tell you, I hope you leave here today until the
story of what you've heard today say, I was out of Laconi Airport. I ran into
my and he was talking about the choice we
face. Just tell him. Tell him I said four more years means more jobs. Tell him I said four more years means
more support for our troops. Wow. Four more years means more judges. Oh,
and you tell him I said I think it's going to take it least four more years
to drain that swamp E got 42 days to go and it's on New Hampshire. So I need you to bring it bring all of
this enthusiasm that you brought out to the airport today. I could tell you, you know, it was four
years ago in a little bit of a little bit more time than I got the phone call
to join this ticket President. I didn't know each other
very well at all. I had met him a couple of times, seen him on TV, right? But honestly, you know, I've worked shoulder to
shoulder with this president every day, and I can tell you firsthand men and
women in New Hampshire there has never been a day even on the unprecedented opposition.
Every step of the way. There's never been a day that President Donald Trump
didn't get up and fight for you. Now it's our turn to fight for him. Him and I know you will, President. I both know the strength of
this country isn't found in the marbled halls of Washington, D. C. It's it's
found in places like Laconia. It's found it's found in the place where live free
or die isn't just a slogan. It's in your hearts to be Oh, it's found in the timeless words of New
Hampshire zone. Daniel Webster who said and I quote God grants liberty on Lee to those who
love it and are always ready to guard and
defend it. Yeah, so that's what I'm challenging you to
do because I really do believe that freedoms on the ballot in this election I believe it with all my heart. That's
why I wanted to come up here to New Hampshire just to challenge you, to go
on, tell freedoms story, tell about everything that we were able to do in
those first three years. And when you go, I encourage you to
have faith, have faith in our fellow Americans in
this first in the nation primary state where you always play an outsized role
in the direction of the nation. Have faith that just a Z they did in 2016.
The people of America are going to see this election with clarity. They're gonna understand
the choice that we face. You know, I'm convinced that a study of American
history teaches that every time the American people are given a choice
between more freedom and less freedom, they choose mawr freedom every single
time. So go go talk to your neighbors and friends s And finally, in these times of great challenge in
the life of our nation, where we seem to see Mawr division than any time in my
lifetime, I'd encourage you to exercise that
other kind of faith to if you're of a mind about the head or
bend the knee from time to time. I encourage you to do that too. And on this one e on this one, I'm not so much asking for
you to pray for a candidate. We're team or the cause. You know, I truly do believe that I
truly do believe that there will always be more that unites
us in this country than could ever divide us. And chief among those things
is faith. So claim those ancient words that if his people who are called by
his name will humble themselves and pray and turn, he'll do like he's
always done in much more challenging times in the life of this nation. He'll
hear from heaven and he'll he'll this land this one nation under God,
indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. So pray for America. Pray for
all the American people. It will make a difference. And I'm absolutely convinced that with
your continued support, with all of this enthusiasm every day for the next
42 days between now November 3rd, we're gonna
make New Hampshire and America stronger than ever before. We're gonna
make New Hampshire in America more prosperous than ever before. And with President Donald Trump in the
White House for four more years with Korkie Messner in a renewed
Republican majority in the United States Senate with Matt Mauer's and
Steve Negrin in a new Republican majority in the Congress way and with God's help, we will make America great again. Again.

oh it's absolutely gorgeous so i have the privilege tonight of introducing my husband and i'm gonna do so by telling you just a little story i want to take you on a very quick little journey a synopsis of our political life so when we started dating mike said to me you know someday i just want you to know i want to represent my hometown in the united states congress and after we got married we felt the call to run in 1988 and we ran on the theme of faith family and freedom and we lost so we decided in 1990 we're gonna run again and mike ran on the theme faith family and freedom and i'm sorry to say we lost again and so we decided to build our dream home mike started a radio show i started a watercolor business god blessed us with three beautiful children and life was going just great and then we felt called to run again in the year 2000 and again we ran on the theme faith family and freedom and god blessed us with a victory that year and over the next over the next 12 years mike pence rose to a leadership role in the congress he ended up being the third highest member of the house of representatives and during that time we had a small home in indiana and mike likes to stay in a smaller home in washington and we raised our children during those 12 years in congress and my kids never felt like they were second fiddle to his political career they never did i mean he would leave the hill he'd come to a lacrosse game and he'd go back he'd leave the hill he'd come to a little poetry show and he'd go back he'd come to a violin recital and he would go back and during those 12 years unless there was a flight delay every sunday we worshiped together as a family and during those years during those years he fought for freedom so even during the 12 years in congress the theme that ran through our home and his career and our lives was faith family and freedom and then we felt called to go home to indiana and to run for governor and again we ran on the theme faith family and freedom and we were preparing to run for our second term as governor and first lady of indiana when lo and behold somebody called and said mike will you be my running mate actually actually he didn't say it that way he said mike it's gonna be great he did and mike said well if there's a question there the answer is yes but president donald trump has shown all of us over the past four years that he is fighting for our faith our families and our freedom we need four more years yes and so we need four more years of president donald trump and we need four more years of vice president mike pence [Music] [Music] is maybe we can see [Music] well hello pennsylvania it is great to be here at the battle spring farm and didn't see something could you join me in thanking a marine corps mom who loves our military families traveling the country supporting our soldiers and a great second lady of the united states of america karen pence [Music] my friend congressman lloyd smucker how great is he [Music] [Applause] been a tremendous ally of our administration taking the strong stands lord we appreciate you so much and uh how about a big round of applause for the whole bollinger family for opening up this spectacular thank you so much but i got to tell you it's good to be with all of you tonight just about two hours and seven minutes to go it's on pennsylvania it's going to be a great night i can tell you i left the president earlier today in the oval office and he's ready we're ready and tonight we start the steady march to 35 days when we'll reelect president donald trump for four more [Music] years i mean really truly it's great to have you all come out tonight the president's off in cleveland nine o'clock eastern you all can check it out right here but i was talking the other day and i said well you know there's some people invited me to go to pennsylvania and he looked at me and he said you go to pennsylvania i'll handle ohio and i know he will i promise you everybody come nine o'clock eastern president donald trump is going to take our case to the american people and he's going to take the fight straight to joe biden but i know you all are here for the same reason i'm here it's not just to watch a debate it's because you all know that it's not even just for that [Applause] but it's because pennsylvania and america need four more years of president donald trump in the white house and the road to victory goes straight through pennsylvania don't doubt it you know four years ago a movement was born a movement of everyday americans from every walk of life here in pennsylvania you believed we could be strong again you believe we could be prosperous again pennsylvania said yes to president donald trump in 2016 and i know come november 3rd pennsylvania is going to say yes to four more years of president donald trump think how far we've come and four years ago we inherited a military that had been hollowed out by devastating budget cuts an economy that under joe biden in the last administration was going through the slowest economic recovery since the great depression terrorism was on the rise around the world and we witnessed a steady assault on our most cherished values but in three short years under the leadership of president donald trump with the strong support of leaders from congress like lloyd schmucker we rebuild our military we've restored the arsenal democracy and we're finally giving our soldiers sailors airmen marines and coast guard the resources and the support that you deserve to accomplish your mission and come home safe and i got to tell you i know karen told you the story of uh that season in our life when those three little kids came along i got to tell you i couldn't be more proud that our oldest is a captain in the united states marine corps and our daughter just married a lieutenant in the united states navy [Applause] and that's why i i couldn't be more proud as a vice president and a dad to serve alongside a president who cares so deeply about the men and women of our armed forces and their families and it hasn't been just those who wear the uniform it's been those who've worn the uniform in the united states i know there's probably more than a few men and women in the room that are that served in our armed forces if you can can you just raise your hand in the air and give us a chance to say thank you one more time thank you for your service let's hear it for these veterans everybody come on [Applause] it's a debt we can never fully repay but on behalf of all the people that just stood and cheered let me say to all the veterans who are here thank you for your service to the united states of america and in those first three years president donald trump stood with our veterans like no president in my lifetime when joe biden was vice president of the united states you remember the years of scandals at the va literally veterans were dying waiting to receive care at our va hospitals and in our first year in office president donald trump signed a reform bill that created all new accountability at the va we have fired thousands of va workers that weren't giving our veterans what they need and now veterans choice is now available to every veteran in america so we stood with our troops we've stood with our veterans and under this president we've stood with working men and women like never before president donald trump rolled up his sleeves in those first three years and i just got to keep mentioning your congressman with the strong support of congressman lloyd smucker we cut taxes across the board we rolled back regulations at an unprecedented level we fought for free and fair trade and we unleashed american energy the fracking revolution is creating tens of thousands of jobs across america and today today while joe biden and his running mate on the record repeatedly about abolishing fossil fuels joe biden said last year he looked a young woman in the eye and he said he said i guarantee i guarantee we'll abolish fossil fuels now he says he's not going to ban fracking but i'll tell you something we just need to listen to him the first four times when he said he was but i promise you this with four more years of president donald trump in the white house we're going to continue to achieve american energy independence and the best is yet to come for pennsylvania and america i mean where joe biden literally in the middle of a global pandemic joe biden wants to raise taxes by four trillion dollars this president cut taxes across the board laid a foundation that now as we beginning to open up pennsylvania again open up america again we're seeing the american economy come roaring back in fact in our first three years alone businesses large and small created seven million good paying jobs and 208 000 jobs right here in pennsylvania the truth is we also stood with america's farmers all along the way i mean i got to tell [Applause] you under under joe biden it was economic surrender countries around the world under president donald trump whether it came to china or our trading partners in the north and south he made it clear the era of economic surrender is over he stood strong for american farmers he stood strong for american workers [Applause] when china started to retaliate against american farmers president trump just he just used some of what we were collecting in tariffs on china and made it available to american farmers over 13 billion dollars to support american agriculture yeah we're making farming great again i love the hand [Music] and one of the ways we did that is when we cut taxes in those first three years we eliminated the death tax for nearly every family farm in america [Applause] i mean the truth is in our first three years the results speak for themselves we rebuilt our military we created and revived a booming economy the strongest economy in the world we launched an energy renaissance where today america is a net exporter of energy for the first time in 70 years and all along the way all along the way president donald trump has stood for the rule of law he kept his word to the people of this great state and we've seen more than 200 principled conservatives appointed to our federal courts at every level including justice neil gorsuch and justice brett kavanaugh [Applause] and i can tell you i've met a lot of these great judges i've met a lot of them and they're all men and women who will uphold all the god-given liberties enshrined in our constitution like the freedom of speech the freedom of religion and the second amendment right to keep and bear arms and you all heard just recently we we marked the passing of a of a true public servant ruth bader ginsburg served for decades on the supreme court and we honor her service in her life but president donald trump did his duty under article 2 of the constitution that stipulates that the president shall appoint judges to the supreme court and last saturday night [Applause] the president announced his decision to appoint a woman of great character with an incredible family a principled conservative who reveres the constitution of the united states he named the next great justice of the supreme court amy coney barrett i'll tell you what when she was confirmed to the court of appeals just a few short years ago one of the democrats on the judiciary committee lamented the fact that her her faith which she called her dogma lived loudly in her yes well i got the same dogma and i'm going to tell you i had a chance to walk her up the steps of the senate today to get her started in the process we got a hearing coming up right around the corner in just a few short weeks with your support the support of all of our republican colleagues every single one of them we can get i promise you judge amy coney barrett is going to become justice amy coney barrett we're going to fill that seat oh we're gonna fail so we stood for the rule of law through judicial appointments stood up for all the ideals that you cherish in great places like lancaster and places like the small town i grew up in and every step of the way president donald trump has stood with the men and women who serve on the thin blue line of law enforcement and all our first responders and we always will you know i got to tell you my uncle was a police officer in chicago illinois for 25 years and my cousin was married to a firefighter for a quarter of a century in the same city but we've got we got first responders in our in our extended family i don't know what it's like to put on that uniform but i know the courage that it takes for them to do it and i admire it every day that's why the president was pleased to announce today that the philadelphia firefighters and paramedics union local 22 of the international association of firefighters endorsed president donald trump for re-election it means a lot it means a lot [Applause] we're grateful for the support of firefighters and all our first responders you know president trump and i know what you all know out this way men and women who serve in law enforcement are some of the best people in this country and they deserve the respect of every american every single day now like all of you the president and i will always respect the right of americans to peaceful protest it's enshrined in the constitution but rioting and looting is not peaceful protest burning businesses is not free speech harming and threatening civilians and law enforcement officers will not be tolerated and those who do these things will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law you know for months all joe biden ever talked about was peaceful protesters remember all summer long literally while the american people were watching watching businesses and streets in our major cities literally burn i made a trip up to minneapolis not long ago and we connected with a wonderful woman named flora westbrook floor is a great african-american business woman she ran a salon that she started about 30 years ago but she told me through a veil of tears the days that followed the killing of george floyd how she literally watched the rioters and looters come closer and closer to her business until that friday night when they burned her out but i told flora we're going to stand with her we're going to stay with her and we're going to rebuild not only her business but all of our cities and we're going to end this violence once and for all and we're going to have law and order for every american of every race and creed and color so help us god [Applause] i mean the truth is joe biden and his running mate would double down on the policies that have literally led to violence in america cities when you undermine support for law enforcement when you cheer as his running mate did los angeles decision to cut 150 million dollars out of the police budget you embolden the worst elements of the community i mean literally joe biden says that america is in his words systemically racist he also says that law enforcement has a quote implicit bias against minorities when joe biden was asked whether he would cut funding for law enforcement he replied quote yes absolutely let me make you a promise lancaster under president donald trump we're not going to defund the police not now now you all know what the president and i know we don't have to choose between supporting law enforcement and supporting all of the families that live in our major cities we have done both for the last three and a half years and we're going to support law enforcement and support our african-american and minority families for four more years in the white house [Applause] so we made incredible progress in those first three years rebuild our military revived our economy strengthened the foundation under the rule of law redoubled our commitment to law and order and then the coronavirus struck from china but i'm here to tell you having led the task force over the last eight months that when president donald trump made the decision to suspend all travel from china before the end of january before the first case of community transmission he saved countless american lives [Applause] no other american president had ever suspended travel from another nation president donald trump took that action he stood up the white house coronavirus task force and bought us an invaluable amount of time to launch the greatest national mobilization since world war ii joe biden when the president suspended travel from china joe biden said it was hysterical xenophobic and was fear-mongering but i can tell you what it was it was leadership that put the health of america first and with the time that we bought we reinvented testing we just cleared 100 million tests done last week more than any other nation in the world by far we develop and and help manufacture literally billions of personal protective equipment no american who required an icu bed was ever denied an icu bed no american who required a ventilator was ever denied a ventilator we work hard with private industry to make sure every american family got the health care that any one of us would want a loved one to have we've developed medicines that have literally been saving lives every day and we are on track to have the first coronavirus vaccine before the end of this year and have tens of millions of doses to administer so we're slowing the spread for protecting the vulnerable we're saving lives and under the president's leadership we're opening up america again on that foundation the president board literally in the last four months more than 10 and a half million americans have already gone back to work i mean there are more americans that have gone back to work in the last four months than got a job in the eight years that joe biden was vice president at the height of the pandemic we lost 22 million jobs but because of the foundation the president poured and because of the unprecedented support congressman lloyd smucker and members of congress frankly in both parties relief for families relief for businesses we've added 10.6 million jobs back including 580 000 jobs back right here in pennsylvania [Applause] we're opening up america again and we're opening up america's schools [Applause] yesterday because of the innovation that the president initiated six months ago with our major research companies we announced in the rose garden and we're going to be distributing 100 million point of care rapid tests to all the states across the country so they can distribute them to school nurses and school systems so our kids can get back in the classroom and our kids can stay back in school safely [Applause] so we've gone through a time of testing you've seen the president's leadership writ large and in those first three years you saw this president deliver on all the promises that he made to people in pennsylvania but we're coming to a time for choosing which is what that debate is all about tonight and i literally can't wait i can't wait somebody said to me uh how long has the president been preparing for the debate i said all his life and he's going to lay out not only what we've done but he's going to lay out the choice he's going to take the fight straight to joe biden i mean look think about the choice that we face here in the middle of a of a global pandemic joe biden wants to raise taxes by four trillion dollars president trump and i we're gonna keep cutting taxes for four more years and bring this economy all the way back and then some joe biden i know the president will bring this up tonight joe biden wants to bury our economy under an avalanche of red tape beginning with the green new deal [Music] you know the only thing green about the green new deal is how much green it's going to cost all of us if they ever pass any of it into law you know the truth of the matter is that for all that we did in those 45 days to slow the spread remember the sacrifices that we made where we shut down literally large parts of our economy we asked businesses and families to make great sacrifices to put the health of america first did you know that in those 45 days we still didn't come close to reaching the emission reductions in the green new deal i mean their environmental agenda would destroy american jobs we're going to keep cutting regulation unleashing energy and we're going to create millions of american jobs in four more years and as i said before where joe biden joe biden was a cheerleader for china for all of the modern owners you know when we took office literally half of our international trade deficit was with china we were losing 500 billion dollars a year to communist china when president donald trump put him on on notice he said those those things are over we stood up to china we imposed tariffs to level the playing field for american workers and joe biden is actually talking about repealing all the tariffs that are level in the playing field but i promise you with four more years in the white house we're going to stand strong against china until they open their markets respect private property and level the playing field for american jobs and american farmers and closer to home you know joe biden was there when they passed nafta into law i tell people across the heartland the impact that nafta had did you know that 60 000 american factories closed in the years from nafta to the present day remember the last administration the last president said about four years ago right now he's asked about manufacturing jobs they'd lost 200 000 manufacturing jobs and he said they were never going to come back he said what magic wand do you have well we didn't need a magic wand we just needed president donald trump in the white house 500 000 manufacturing jobs created in our first three years and with the new trade deal that got rid of nafta the united states mexico canada agreement it's actually expected to increase exports by tens of billions of dollars create tens of thousands of jobs and standing here on this wonderful farm i'm proud to report under the usmca we're we're projected to increase dairy exports by more than 300 million dollars a year that's what winning looks like pennsylvania that's the leadership of president donald trump so it's been about it's been about security and prosperity but it's also been about our most cherished values and i hope that comes up tonight i mean truthfully when joe biden was vice president of the united states they literally hauled the little sisters of the poor into federal court to force them to compromise their faith to comply with the strictures and mandates of obamacare president donald trump when we came into office we ended the assault on the little sisters of the poor and the supreme court of the united states just made it permanent [Applause] under president donald trump we are going to stand for the religious freedom of every american of every faith every single day and maybe most important of all to our little family and so many of yours at a time when joe biden supports late term abortion and using taxpayer dollars to pay for abortion all the way up to the moment of birth i couldn't be more proud to serve as vice president to a president who stands without apology for the sanctity of human life president donald trump is the most pro-life president in american history i mean when you look at their agenda it's clear joe biden would be nothing more than a trojan horse for the radical left it's overtaken the democratic party now joe biden said at their convention i don't know did you watch some of their convention i didn't watch much of it either was like a it was like a zoom hr meeting or something but you know at their convention joe biden said democracy is on the ballot we might hear him say something like that in the debate tonight i'll tell you what president trump and i know is that the economy is on the ballot law and order are on the ballot but you know we also know there are things uh more foundational and more fundamental to our country than that you know when i think of this election when i think of those values that my wife shared with you have always characterized our calling and define the leadership of your present commitment to the timeless american ideals of faith and family and freedom i'm absolutely convinced that come election day it's not going to be uh whether america is more conservative or more liberal whether we're more republican or more democrat more red or more blue i i think the choice in this election gonna come down to whether america remains america so if you believe in faith and family and freedom and patriotism we got to decide right here and right now that joe biden will never be president of the united states we're going to re-elect president donald trump for four more years [Applause] just got to decide pennsylvania [Applause] you did it before i know you're going to do it again so bring all your enthusiasm all right and after you see this debate tonight you'll forget i was even here because he's going to bring it he's going to bring it but i want you to take the message that you've heard the president talk about go talk to your neighbors and friends if you believe as i do what's at stake in this election i just need you to do what you did before four years ago i mean tell them all that we accomplished in those first three years together tell them what this president's leadership has accomplished through this challenging time in the life of our nation and made it possible for the great american comeback that's underway and tell them tell them four more years means more jobs tell them four more years means more judges four more years means more support for our troops [Applause] four more years means more support for law enforcement and all of our first responders and tell them tell them i ran into mike out on the farm and he said it's going to take at least four more years to drain that swamp will you go tell it because i'm absolutely convinced i'm absolutely convinced on this big debate night that what happened in 2016 is happening again all across this country the people people aren't listening to the pundits and the so-called elites in washington dc we're just talking to their neighbors and friends and i got to tell you i'll never forget karen and i will never forget that election night we were standing right next to the president you can go online and look it up these young people will help you find it there's a they've got a good picture we're there at the campaign headquarters weren't we dear in new york city and every time every time an estate came in he was standing next to me he's a little bit taller than me he would turn to me and he'd just tap me on the shoulder and say look at that said look at that he said indiana came in great you see hank georgia came in good right south carolina good but i gotta tell you when pennsylvania came through i thought he was gonna knock me down so you got to do it again pennsylvania [Applause] you did it before and you can do it again you just got to have faith he's got to have faith i think what happened in 2016 is the american people just we had faith in one another we had faith in our highest ideals we had faith that when you when you lifted up freedom the american people would rally to your cause so when you talk to your neighbors and friends have faith because i i can honestly tell you that a long study of american history shows that in this state where literally our freedom was minted in that great constitution 1787. every time the american people have been given a clear choice between more freedom and less freedom they choose more freedom every single time so have faith when you talk to your neighbors and friends and i'd encourage you also to have that other kind of faith if you're inclined to bow the head and bend the knee over the next 35 some odd days i encourage you to do got it there's a verse in the old book i especially like says the horse is made ready for the day of battle but victory comes from the lord so you pray you pray for a victory not just not just for our team not just for our great supporters around the country but i mean let's go out there and win a victory for america come november 3rd and a victory for everything that has always made america great and will make america great again let's go win it and i'm absolutely convinced if all of us will do all that we need to do between now november 3rd i promise you the president and i are going to be in this fight you'll see it tonight and karen and i are going to head to salt lake city next week and do our level best as [Applause] but well single day i promise you served alongside him shoulder to shoulder when the cameras are off when nobody's looking i can promise you president donald trump has never stopped fighting for you now it's your turn to fight for him so let's bring it pennsylvania i'm absolutely convinced that with your strong support with your strong voice to your neighbors and friends in every day over the next 35 days congressman lloyd smucker back in a republican majority in the united states house of representatives with strong conservative leaders elected and re-elected all across this state in this nation with four more years of president donald trump in the white house and with god's help we're going to make pennsylvania more prosperous than you could possibly imagine we're going to make all of pennsylvania and america safer than ever before and with your

poor into federal court to force PRON to compromise PRON faith to comply with the stricture and mandate of obamacare president donald trump when PRON come into office PRON end the assault on the little sister of the poor and the supreme court of the united states just make PRON permanent applause under president donald trump PRON be go to stand for the religious freedom of every american of every faith every single day and maybe most important of all to PRON little family and so many of PRON at a time when joe biden support late term abortion and use taxpayer dollar to pay for abortion all the way up to the moment of birth i could not be more proud to serve as vice president to a president who stand without apology for the sanctity of human life president donald trump be the most pro life president in american history i mean when PRON look at PRON agenda PRON be clear joe biden would be nothing more than a trojan horse for the radical left PRON be overtake the democratic party

116,Xsy8LbAgoos,pence,2020-10-07T00:00:00Z,VP Debate (Pence),speech,"Susan, thank you. And I want to thank the Commission and the University of Utah for hosting this event. And Senator Harris, it's a privilege to be on the stage with you. And our nation has gone through a very challenging time this year. But I want the American people to know that from the very first day, President Donald Trump has put the health of America first. Before there were more than five cases in the United States, all people who had returned from China, President Donald Trump did what no other American president had ever done. And that was, he suspended all travel from China, the second largest economy in the world. Now, Senator Joe Biden opposed that decision. He said it was xenophobic and hysterical. But I can tell you having led the white house coronavirus task force that that decision alone by President Trump bought us invaluable time to stand up the greatest national mobilization since World War Two. And I believe it saved hundreds of thousands of American lives. Because with that time, we were able to reinvent testing. More than 115 million tests had been done to date. We were able to see to the delivery of billions of supplies, so our doctors and nurses had the resources support they needed. And we began, really, before the month of February we started to develop a vaccine and to develop medicines and therapeutics that have been saving lives all along the way. And under President Trump's leadership, Operation Warp Speed, we believe we'll have literally tens of millions of doses of a vaccine before the end of this year. The reality is, when you look at the Biden plan, it reads an awful lot like what President Trump, and I, and our task force has been doing every step of the way. And quite frankly, when I look at their plan that talks about advancing testing, creating new PPE, developing a vaccine, it looks a little bit like plagiarism, which is something Joe Biden knows a little bit about. And I think the American people know that this is a president who has put the health- ... of America first. And the American people, I believe with my heart, can be proud- ... of the sacrifices they have made. It's saved countless American lives- Susan, I have to weigh in here- I have to weigh in. There's not a day gone by that I haven't thought of every American family that's lost a loved one. And I want all of you to know that you'll always be in our hearts and in our prayers. But when you say what the American people have done over these last eight months, hasn't worked, that's a great disservice to the sacrifices the American people have made- But the reality... If I may finish, Senator. The reality is Dr. Fauci said everything that he told the president in the Oval Office, the president told the American. Now President Trump, I will tell you, has boundless confidence in the American people, and he always spoke with confidence that we'd get through this together. But when you say it hasn't worked... When Dr. Fauci, and Dr. Birx, and our medical experts came to us in the second week of March, they said, if the president didn't take the unprecedented step of shutting down roughly half of the American economy, that we could lose 2.2 million Americans. That's the reality. They also said to us, if we did everything right, Susan, we could still lose more than 200,000 Americans. One life lost is too many, Susan. But the American people, I believe, deserve credit for the sacrifices that they have made, putting the health of their family and their neighbors first, our doctors, our nurses, our first responders. And I'm going to speak up on behalf of what the American people have done. Well, the American people have demonstrated over the last eight months, that when given the facts, they're willing to put the health of their families and their neighbors and people they don't even know first. President Trump and I have great confidence in the American people and their ability to take that information and put it into practice. In the height of the epidemic when we were losing a heartbreaking number of 2,500 Americans a day, we surged resources to New Jersey and New York and New Orleans and Detroit. We told the American people what needed to be done, and the American people made the sacrifices. When the outbreak in the Sun Belt happened this summer, again, Americans stepped forward. But the reality is the work of the President of the United States goes on. A vacancy on the Supreme Court of the United States has come upon us, and the President introduced Judge Amy Coney Barrett. If I may say, that Rose Garden event, been a great deal of speculation about it. My wife, Karen and I were there and honored to be there. Many of the people who were at that event, Susan, actually were tested for Coronavirus, and it was an outdoor event, which all of our scientists regularly and routinely advise. The difference here is President Trump and I trust the American people to make choices in the best interest of their health. Joe Biden and Kamala Harris consistently talk about mandates, and not just mandates with the Coronavirus, but a government takeover of healthcare, the Green New Deal, all government control. We're about freedom and respecting the freedom of the American people. Which we've always done. Susan, we talked about this. Well, Susan, thank you. Although, I would like to go back. Well, thank you, but I would like to go back because the reality is that we're going to have a vaccine, Senator, in record time. In unheard of time, in less than a year. We have five companies in phase three clinical trials. And we're right now producing tens of millions of doses. So the fact that you continue to undermine public confidence in a vaccine, if the vaccine emerges during the Trump administration, I think is unconscionable. And Senator, I just ask you, stop playing politics with people's lives. The reality is that we will have a vaccine, we believe, before the end of this year. And it will have the capacity to save countless American lives. And your continuous undermining of confidence in a vaccine is just, it's unacceptable. And let me also say, the reality is, when you talk about failure in this administration, we actually do know what failure looks like in a pandemic. It was 2009. The Swine flu arrived in the United States. Thankfully, it ended up not being as lethal as the Coronavirus. But before the end of the year, when Joe Biden was Vice President of the United States, not seven and a half million people contracted the Swine flu, 60 million Americans contracted the Swine flu. If the Swine flu had been as lethal as the Coronavirus in 2009 when Joe Biden was Vice President, we would have lost 2 million American lives. His own chief of staff, Ron Klain would say last year that it was pure luck that they did, ""Everything possible wrong."" And we learned from that. They left the strategic national stockpile empty. They left an empty and hollow plan, but we still learn from it, and I think the American people, I'm going to say again, can be proud of what we have done. And Senator, please stop undermining confidence in a vaccine. Well, Susan, thank you. And let me say on behalf of the President and the First Lady, how moved we've all been by the outpouring of prayers and concern for the President. And I do believe it's emblematic of the prayers and the concern that have ushered forth for every American impacted by the Coronavirus. But the care of the President received at Walter Reed Hospital, the White House doctors was exceptional. And the transparency that they practiced all along the way will continue. The American people have a right to know about- ... they will continue. The American people have a right to know about the health and well-being of their president, and we'll continue to do that. But I'm just extremely grateful and was more than a little moved by the broad and bipartisan support. And Senator, I want to thank you and Joe Biden for your expressions and genuine concern. And I also want to congratulate you, as I did on that phone call, on the historic nature of your nomination. I never expected to be on this stage four years ago, so I know the feeling, but the reality is we've got an election before the American people in the midst of this challenging year and the stakes have never been higher, but I think the choice has never been here. Susan, Susan- Well, look, I respect the fact that Joe Biden spent 47 years in public life. I respect your public service as well. The American people have a president who was a businessman, he's a job creator. Who's paid tens of millions of dollars in taxes, payroll taxes, property taxes. He's created tens of thousands of American jobs. And the President said those public reports are not accurate. And the President's also released literally stacks of financial disclosures the American people can review just as the law allows. But the distinction here is that Joe Biden, 47 years in public service compared to President Donald Trump, who brought all of that experience four years ago- ... and turned this economy around by cutting taxes, rolling back regulations- ... unleashing American energy, fighting for free and fair trade. And all of that's on the line- ... if Joe Biden and Kamala Harris are elected. When President Trump and I took office, America had gone through the slowest economic recovery since the Great Depression. It was when Joe Biden was vice president, they tried to tax and spend, and regulate, and bail our way back to a growing economy. President Trump cut taxes across the board. Despite what Senator Harris says, the average American family of four had $2,000 in savings in taxes. And with the rise in wages that occurred, most predominantly for blue collar, hardworking Americans, the average household income for a family of four increased by $4,000 following President Trump's tax cuts. But America, you just heard Senator Harris tell you, on day one, Joe Biden's going to raise your taxes. It's really remarkable to think- I mean, right after a time where we're going through a pandemic that lost 22 million jobs at the height, we've already added back 11.6 million jobs because we had a president who cut taxes, rolled back regulation, unleashed American energy, fought for free and fair trade and secured four trillion dollars from the Congress of the United States to give direct payments to families, save 50 million jobs through the Paycheck Protection Program. We literally have spared no expense to help the American people and the American worker through this. Joe Biden and Kamala Harris want to raise taxes. They want to bury our economy under a two trillion dollar Green New Deal, which you were one of the original co-sponsors of in the United States Senate. They want to abolish [silence 00:08:13-00:28:41] ... the American comeback is on the ballot with four more years of growth and opportunity. ... and four more years of president Donald Trump, 2021- ... is going to be the biggest economic year in the history of this country. He said he's going to repeal the Trump tax cuts. The important [inaudible 00:29:15] is you said the truth. Joe Biden has said it twice in the debate last week that he's going to repeal the Trump tax cuts. That was tax cuts that gave the average working family $2,000 in a tax break every single year- Senator, that's the math. Is he the only going to repeal part of the Trump tax cuts? Please. Susan, please [crosstalk 00:30:54] Yes, but we need to give Vice President Pence his time. Well. I hope we have a chance to talk about healthcare because Obamacare was a disaster, and the American people remember it well. And President Trump and I have a plan to improve healthcare and protect preexisting conditions for every American. But look, Senator Harris, you're entitled to your own opinion, but you're not entitled to your own facts. You yourself said on multiple occasions when you were running for president, that you would ban fracking. Joe Biden looked at a supporter in the eye and pointed and said, ""I guarantee, I guarantee that we will abolish fossil fuels."" They have a $2 trillion version of the Green New Deal, Susan, that your newspaper, USA Today, said really wasn't that very different from the original Green New Deal. More taxes, more regulation, banning fracking, abolishing fossil fuel, crushing American energy and economic surrender to China is a prescription for economic decline. President Trump and I will keep America growing, the V-shape recovery that's underway right now will continue with four more years of President Donald Trump [crosstalk 00:32:37] Thank you, Susan. Well, first, I'm very proud of our record on the environment, on conservation. According to all of the best estimates, our air and land are cleaner than any time ever recorded. Our water is among the cleanest in the world. And just a little while ago, the president signed the Outdoors Act. It's the largest investment in our public lands and public parks in 100 years. So President Trump has made a commitment to conservation and to the environment. Now with regard to climate change, the climate is changing, but the issue is what's the cause and what do we do about it? President Trump has made it clear that we're going to continue to listen to the science. Now Joe Biden and Kamala Harris would put us back in the Paris Climate Accord. They'd impose the Green New Deal, which would crush American energy, would increase the energy costs of American families in their homes, and literally would crush American jobs. And President Trump and I believe that the progress that we have made in a cleaner environment has been happening precisely because we have a strong, free market economy. What's remarkable is the United States has reduced CO2 more than the countries that are still in the Paris Climate Accord, but we've done it through innovation. And we've done it through natural gas and fracking, which Senator, the American people can go look at the record. I know Joe Biden says otherwise now, as you do, but the both of you repeatedly committed to abolishing fossil fuel and banning of fracking. And so by creating the kind of American innovation, we're actually steering toward a stronger and better environment. With regard to wildfires, President Trump and I believe that forest management has to be front and center. And even Governor Gavin Newsom from your state has agreed, we've got to work on forest management. And with regard to hurricanes, the National Oceanic Administration tells us that actually as difficult as they are, there are no more hurricanes today than there were 100 years ago- ... but many of the climate alarmists- ... use hurricanes and wildfires to try and sell the goods of a Green New Deal. And President Trump and I are going to always put- ... American jobs and American workers first. As I said, Susan, the climate is changing. We'll follow the science, but once again, Senator Harris is denying the fact that they're going to raise taxes on every American. Joe Biden said twice in the debate last week... As I said, Susan, the climate is changing. We'll follow the science. But once again, Senator Harris is denying the fact that they're going to raise taxes on every American. Joe Biden said twice in the debate last week, that on day one, he was going to repeal the Trump tax cuts. Those tax cuts delivered $2,000 in tax relief to the average family of four across America. And with regard to banning fracking, I just recommend that people look at the record. You yourself said repeatedly that you would ban fracking. You were the first Senate co-sponsor of the Green New Deal. And while Joe Biden denied the green new deal, Susan, thank you for pointing out. The Green New Deal is on their campaign website. And as USA TODAY said, it's essentially the same plan as you co-sponsored with AOC when she submitted it in the Senate. And you just heard the Senator say that she's going to resubmit America to the Paris climate accord. Look, the American people have always cherished our environment and will continue to cherish it. We've made great progress reducing CO2 emissions through American innovation and the development of natural gas through fracking. We don't need a massive $2 trillion Green New Deal that would impose all new mandates on American businesses and American families. Joe Biden wants us to retrofit- Four million business- Buildings. It makes no sense. It will cost jobs. President Trump- He's going to put America first. He's going to put jobs first and we're going to take care of our environment and follow the science. Well, I'd love to respond. Look, lost the trade war with China? Joe Biden never fought it. Joe Biden has been a cheerleader for communist China over the last several decades. And again, Senator Harris, you're entitled to your opinion. You're not entitled to your own facts. When Joe Biden was vice-president, we lost 200,000 manufacturing jobs. And president Obama said they were never coming back. He said, we needed a magic wand to bring them back. In our first three years after we cut taxes- Roll back regulation, unleashed American energy. This administration saw 500,000 manufacturing- Jobs created, and that's exactly the kind of growth we're going to continue to see as we bring our nation through- This pandemic. A Green New Deal- You're passing new mandates, your Paris Climate Accord. It's going to kill jobs this time, just like it killed jobs- 15 seconds. And then we move on. Thank you, Susan. Well, before I leave that, let me speak to voting records if I can. Everybody knows that NAFTA costs literally thousands of American factories to close. We saw automotive jobs go South of the border. President Trump fought to renegotiate NAFTA. In the United States, Mexico and Canada the agreement is now the law of the land. American people deserve to know Senator Kamala Harris was one of only 10 members of the Senate to vote against the USMCA. It was a huge win for American auto workers. It was a huge win for American farmers, especially dairy in the upper Midwest. But Senator you said it didn't go far enough on climate change, you put your radical environmental agenda ahead of American auto workers and a head of American jobs. I think the American people deserve to know that it's probably why Newsweek magazine said that Kamala Harris was the most liberal member of the United States Senate in 2019, more liberal than Bernie Sanders, more liberal than any of the others in the United States Senate. So now with regard to China, Susan first and foremost, China is to blame for the coronavirus and President Trump is not happy about it. He's made that very clear, made it clear again today that China and the world health organization did not play straight with the American people. They did not let our personnel into China to get information on the Coronavirus until the middle of February. Fortunately, President Trump in dealing with China from the outset of this administration, standing up to China that had been taking advantage of America for decades in the wake of Joe Biden's cheerleading for China. President Trump made that decision before the end of January to suspend all travel from China. And again, the American people deserve to know Joe Biden opposed President Trump's decision to suspend all travel from China. He said it was hysterical. He said it was- The President Trump has stood up- To China. We're going to continue to stand strong. We want to improve the relationship, but we're going to level the playing field and we're going to hold China accountable- for what they did to America with the coronavirus. Not true. Thank you. Well, President Trump kept his word when we moved the American embassy to Jerusalem, the capital of the state of Israel. When Joe Biden was vice president, they promised to do that and they never did. We stood strong with our allies, but we've been demanding. NATO is now contributing more to our common defense than ever before thanks to President Trump's leadership. We've strengthened our alliances across the Asia Pacific, and we've stood strong against those who would do us harm. When President Trump came into office, ISIS had captured an area of the middle East, the size of Pennsylvania, but President Trump unleashed the American military and our armed forces destroy the ISIS caliphate and took down their leader, al-Baghdadi without one American casualty. Al-Baghdadi was responsible for the death of thousands, but notably America's hearts today are with the family of Kayla Mueller. Her parents, which are here with us tonight in Salt Lake City. Today, two of the ISIS killers responsible for Kayla Mueller's murder were brought to justice in the United States. Jihadi John was killed on the battlefield along with the other beetle. The reality is that when Joe Biden was vice president, we had an opportunity to save Kayla Mueller. Breaks my heart to reflect on it, but the military came into the oval office, presented a plan, they said they knew where Kayla was. Baghdadi had held her for 18 months, abused or mercilessly before they killed her, but when Joe Biden was Vice President they hesitated for a month, and when armed forces finally went in, it was clear she'd been moved two days earlier. And her family says with a heart that broke the heart of every American, that if president Donald Trump had been president, they believe Kayla would be alive today. So, if we destroy the ISIS caliphate and you talk about re-entering the Iran nuclear deal. I mean the last administration transferred $1.8 billion to the leading state sponsor of terrorism. President Donald Trump got us out of the deal- ... And when Qassem Soleimani was traveling to Baghdad- ... To do harm to Americans, President Donald Trump took him out- ... And America is safer, our allies are safer and the American people know president Donald Trump will never take action [crosstalk 00:00:16:40]. I really have to respond to that. She has- Well, I've got to have more then that. Look- Slanders against President Donald Trump regarding men and women of our armed forces are absurd. My son is in captain in the United States Marine Corps. My son-in-law's deployed in the United States Navy. I can assure all of you with sons and daughters serving in our military, President Donald Trump, not only respects, but reveres all of those who serve in our armed forces and any suggestion, otherwise is ridiculous. Let me also say the American people deserve to know- ... Joe Biden [crosstalk 00:20:00]. Go right ahead. Well, thank you for the question, but I'll use a little bit of my time to respond to that very important issue before. The American people deserve to know Qassem Soleimani, the Iranian general was responsible for the death of hundreds of American service members. When the opportunity came, we saw him headed to Baghdad to kill more Americans. President Trump didn't hesitate and Qassem Soleimani is gone, but you deserve to know the Joe Biden and Kamala Harris actually criticized the decision to take out Qassem Soleimani. it's really inexplicably, but with regard to Joe Biden, it's explainable because history records a Joe Biden actually opposed the raid against a Osama bin Ladin. It's absolutely essential that we have a commander in chief who will not hesitate to act to protect American lives and to protect American service members, and that's what you have in President Donald Trump. Now with regard to the Supreme court- [Silence]. ... become Justice Amy Coney Barrett, and she's a brilliant woman and she will bring a lifetime of experience and a sizeable American family to the Supreme court of the United States, and our hope is in the hearing next week, unlike Justice Cavenaugh received with treatment from you and others, that we hope she gets a fair hearing. And we particularly hope that we don't see the kind of attacks on her Christian faith that we saw before. I mean, the Democrat chairman of the Judiciary Committee before, when Judge Barrett was being confirmed for the court of appeals, expressed concern that the dogma of her faith lived loudly and her, and Dick Durbin of Illinois said that it was a concern. Senator, I know one of our judicial nominees you actually attacked, because they were a member of the Catholic Knights of Columbus. Just because the Knights of Columbus holds pro-life views- ... And [crosstalk 00:23:06]. So, my hope is that when the hearing takes place that- ... That Judge Amy Coney Barrett will be respectfully voted and confirmed into the Supreme court of the United States. Well, thank you, Susan, but let me just say, addressing your very first question. I couldn't be more proud to serve as vice president to a president who stands without apology for the sanctity of human life. I'm pro-life. I don't apologize for it, and this is another one of those cases where there's such a dramatic contrast. Joe Biden and Kamala Harris support taxpayer funding of abortion all the way up to the moment of birth. Late term abortion. They want to increase funding to Planned Parenthood of America. For our part, I would never presume how Judge Amy Coney Barrett would rule on the Supreme Court of the United States, but we'll continue to stand strong for the right to life. When you speak about the Supreme Court, though, I think the American people really deserve an answer, Senator Harris. Are you and Joe Biden going to pack the court if Judge Amy Coney Barrett is confirmed? I mean, there've been 29 vacancies on the Supreme Court during presidential election years from George Washington to Barack Obama. Presidents have nominated in all 29 cases, but your party is actually openly advocating, adding seats to the Supreme court, which has had nine seats for 150 years if you don't get your way. This is a classic case of if you can't win by the rules, you're going to change the rules. Now you've refused to answer the question. Joe Biden has refused to answer the question- No, you've refused to answer the question. Joe Biden has refused to answer the question. So I think the American people would really like to know if Judge Amy Coney Barrett is confirmed at the Supreme Court of the United States. Are you and Joe Biden, if somehow you win this election, going to pack the Supreme Court to get your way? No, I'd like you to answer the question. People, Susan, are voting right now. They'd like to know if you and Joe Biden are going to pack the Supreme Court if you don't get your way in this nomination. You, once again, gave a non-answer. Joe Biden gave a non-answer. You know the people deserve a straight answer, and if you haven't figured it out yet, the straight answer is they are going to pack the Supreme Court if they somehow win this election. Men and women, I got to tell you people across this country, if you cherish our Supreme Court, if you cherish the separation of powers, you need to reject the Biden Harris ticket come November the third, reelect President Donald Trump, and we'll stand by that separation powers in a nine seats Supreme Court. Please. I just want the record to reflect she never answered the question. Maybe in the next debate Joe Biden will answer the question, but I think the American people know the answer. Well, our heart breaks for the loss of any innocent American life and the family of Breonna Taylor has our sympathies. But I trust our justice system, a grand jury that refuse the evidence. And it really is remarkable that as a former prosecutor, you would assume that an impaneled grand jury looking at all the evidence, got it wrong. But you're entitled to your opinion, Senator. I think, and with regard to George Floyd, there's no excuse for what happened to George Floyd. Justice will be served, but there's also no excuse for the rioting and looting that followed. I mean, it really is astonishing. Flora Westbrook is with us here tonight in Salt Lake city. Just a few weeks ago, I stood at what used to be her salon, it was burned to the ground by rioters and looters. And Flora is still trying to put her life back together. And I must tell you, this presumption that you hear consistently from Joe Biden and Kamala Harris, that America is systemically racist, and that as Joe Biden said that he believes that law enforcement has an implicit bias against minorities is a great insult to the men and women who serve in law enforcement. And I want everyone to know who puts on the uniform of law enforcement every day, President Trump and I stand with you. And it is remarkable that when Senator Tim Scott tried to pass a police reform bill, brought together a group of Republicans and Democrats, Senator Harris, you got up and walked out of the room and then you filibustered Senator Tim Scott's bill on the Senate floor that would have provided new accountability, new repeat resources. We don't have to choose between supporting law enforcement, proving public safety and supporting our African-American neighbors and all of our minorities. Under President Trump's leadership- We'll always stand with law enforcement and we'll do what we've done- From day one, it is improve the lives of African-Americans, record unemployment, record investments in education. We'll fight for school choice for all of [crosstalk 00:36:46]. Not. Not true. Thank you, Susan. I appreciate that very much. I think this is one of the things that makes people dislike the media so much in this country, Susan, is that you selectively edit just like Senator Harris did, comments that President Trump and I and others on our side made. I mean, Senator Harris conveniently admitted after the President made comments about people on either side of the debate over monuments, he condemned the KKK, neo-Nazis and white supremacists and has done so repeatedly. You're concerned that he doesn't condemn neo-Nazis. President Trump has Jewish grandchildren. His daughter and son-in-law are Jewish. This is a President who respects and cherishes all of the American people. But you talk about having personally prosecuted. I'm glad you brought up your record, Senator. I really need to make this point. When you were DA in San Francisco, when you left office, African-Americans were 19 times more likely to be prosecuted for minor drug offenses than whites and Hispanics. When you were Attorney General of California, you increased the disproportionate incarceration of blacks in California. You did nothing on criminal justice reform in California. You didn't lift a finger to pass the first step back on Capitol Hill. I mean, the reality is your record speaks for itself. President Trump and I have fought for criminal justice before- We fought for educational choice and opportunities for African-Americans and all of our members. And we'll do it for four more years. Well, Susan, first and foremost, I think we're going to win this election. Because while Joe Biden and Kamala Harris rattle off a long litany of the establishment in Washington, DC and establishment that Joe Biden's been a part of for 47 years, president Donald Trump has as launched a movement of everyday Americans from every walk of life. And I have every confidence that the same Americans that delivered that historic victory in 2016, they see this president's record where we rebuild our military. We revived our economy through tax cuts and rolling back regulation, fighting for fair trade, unleashing American energy. We appointed conservatives to our federal courts at every level. And we stood with the men and women of law enforcement every single day. And I think that movement of Americans has only grown stronger in the last four years. But when you talk about accepting the outcome of the election, I must tell you. Senator, your party has spent the last three and a half years trying to overturn the results of the last election. It's amazing. When Joe Biden was vice president of the United States, the FBI actually spied on president Trump and my campaign. I mean, there were documents released this week that the CIA actually made a referral to the FBI, documenting that those allegations were coming from the Hillary Clinton campaign. And of course, we've all seen the avalanche, what you put the country through for the better part of three years, until it was found that there was no obstruction, no collusion, case closed. And then Senator Harris, you and your colleagues in the Congress tried to impeach the president of the United States over a phone call. And now Hillary Clinton has actually said to Joe Biden that, in her words, under no circumstances, should he concede the election. So let me just say, I think we're going to win this election. President Trump and I are fighting every day in courthouses to prevent Joe Biden and Kamala Harris from changing the rules and creating this universal mail in voting that'll create a massive opportunity for voter fraud. And we have a free and fair election. We know we're going to have confidence in it. And I believe in all my heart that president Donald Trump is going to be reelected for four more years. Brecklin, it's a wonderful question. And let me just commend you for taking an interest in public life. I started following the news when I was very young. And in America, we believe in a free and open exchange of debate. And we celebrate that. It's how we've created literally the freest and most prosperous nation in the history of the world. I would tell you that, don't assume that what you're seeing on your local news networks is synonymous with the American people. I look at the relationship between Justice Ruth Bader Ginsberg, the late justice who we just lost from the Supreme Court, and the late justice Antonin Scalia. They were on polar opposites on the Supreme Court of the United States. One very liberal one, very conservative. But what's been learned since her passing was the two of them and their families were the very closest of friends. Here in America, we can disagree. We can debate vigorously as Senator Harris and I have on this stage tonight. But when the debate is over, we come together as Americans. And that's what people do, in big cities and small towns all across this country. So I just want to encourage you, Brecklin. I want to tell you that we're going to work every day to have government as good as our people, and the American people each and every day. Love a good debate. We love a good argument. But we always come together and are always there for one another in times of need. And we've especially learned that through the difficulties of this year.",b susan thank PRON and i want to thank the commission and the university of utah for host this event and senator harris it be a privilege to be on the stage with PRON and PRON nation have go through a very challenging time this year but i want the american people to know that from the very first day president donald trump have put the health of america first before there be more than five case in the united states all people who have return from china president donald trump do what no other american president have ever do and that be PRON suspend all travel from china the second large economy in the world now senator joe biden oppose that decision PRON say PRON be xenophobic and hysterical but i can tell PRON have lead the white house coronavirus task force that that decision alone by president trump buy PRON invaluable time to stand up the great national mobilization since world war two and i believe PRON save hundred of thousand of american life because with that time PRON be able to reinvent testing more than million test have be do to date PRON be able to see to the delivery of billion of supply so PRON doctor and nurse have the resource support PRON need and PRON begin really before the month of february PRON start to develop a vaccine and to develop medicine and therapeutic that have be save life all along the way and under president trump leadership operation warp speed PRON believe we ll have literally ten of million of dose of a vaccine before the end of this year the reality be when PRON look at the biden plan PRON read an awful lot like what president trump and i and PRON task force have be do every step of the way and quite frankly when i look at PRON plan that talk about advance testing create new ppe develop a vaccine PRON look a little bit like plagiarism which be something joe biden know a little bit about and i think the american people know that this be a president who have put the health of america first and the american people i believe with PRON heart can be proud of the sacrifice PRON have make it save countless american lives susan i have to weigh in here i have to weigh in there be not a day go by that i haven t think of every american family that lose a loved one and i want all of PRON to know that you ll always be in PRON heart and in PRON prayer but when PRON say what the american people have do over these last eight month hasn t work that be a great disservice to the sacrifice the american people have made but the reality if i may finish senator the reality be dr fauci say everything that PRON tell the president in the oval office the president tell the american now president trump i will tell PRON have boundless confidence in the american people and PRON always speak with confidence that we d get through this together but when PRON say PRON hasn t work when dr fauci and dr birx and PRON medical expert come to PRON in the second week of march PRON say if the president didn t take the unprecedented step of shut down roughly half of the american economy that PRON could lose million americans that be the reality PRON also say to PRON if PRON do everything right susan PRON could still lose more than americans one life lose be too many susan but the american people i believe deserve credit for the sacrifice that PRON have make put the health of PRON family and PRON neighbor first PRON doctor PRON nurse PRON first responder and i m go to speak up on behalf of what the american people have do well the american people have demonstrate over the last eight month that when give the fact they re willing to put the health of PRON family and PRON neighbor and people PRON don t even know first president trump and i have great confidence in the american people and PRON ability to take that information and put PRON into practice in the height of the epidemic when PRON be lose a heartbreaking number of americans a day PRON surge resource to new jersey and new york and new orleans and detroit PRON tell the american people what need to be do and the american people make the sacrifice when the outbreak in the sun belt happen this summer again americans step forward but the reality be the work of the president of the united states go on a vacancy on the supreme court of the united states have come upon PRON and the president introduce judge amy coney barrett if i may say that rise garden event be a great deal of speculation about PRON PRON wife karen and i be there and honor to be there many of the people who be at that event susan actually be test for coronavirus and PRON be an outdoor event which all of PRON scientist regularly and routinely advise the difference here be president trump and i trust the american people to make choice in the good interest of PRON health joe biden and kamala harris consistently talk about mandate and not just mandate with the coronavirus but a government takeover of healthcare the green new deal all government control we re about freedom and respect the freedom of the american people which we ve always do susan PRON talk about this well susan thank PRON although i would like to go back well thank PRON but i would like to go back because the reality be that we re go to have a vaccine senator in record time in unheard of time in less than a year PRON have five company in phase three clinical trial and we re right now produce ten of million of dose so the fact that PRON continue to undermine public confidence in a vaccine if the vaccine emerge during the trump administration i think be unconscionable and senator i just ask PRON stop play politic with people life the reality be that PRON will have a vaccine PRON believe before the end of this year and PRON will have the capacity to save countless american life and PRON continuous undermining of confidence in a vaccine be just it unacceptable and let PRON also say the reality be when PRON talk about failure in this administration PRON actually do know what failure look like in a pandemic PRON be the swine flu arrive in the united states thankfully PRON end up not be as lethal as the coronavirus but before the end of the year when joe biden be vice president of the united states not seven and a half million people contract the swine flu million americans contract the swine flu if the swine flu have be as lethal as the coronavirus in when joe biden be vice president PRON would have lose million american life PRON own chief of staff ron klain would say last year that PRON be pure luck that PRON do everything possible wrong and PRON learn from that PRON leave the strategic national stockpile empty PRON leave an empty and hollow plan but PRON still learn from PRON and i think the american people i m go to say again can be proud of what PRON have do and senator please stop undermine confidence in a vaccine well susan thank PRON and let PRON say on behalf of the president and the first lady how move we ve all be by the outpouring of prayer and concern for the president and i do believe it emblematic of the prayer and the concern that have usher forth for every american impact by the coronavirus but the care of the president receive at walter reed hospital the white house doctor be exceptional and the transparency that PRON practice all along the way will continue the american people have a right to know about PRON will continue the american people have a right to know about the health and well being of PRON president and we ll continue to do that but i m just extremely grateful and be more than a little move by the broad and bipartisan support and senator i want to thank PRON and joe biden for PRON expression and genuine concern and i also want to congratulate PRON as i do on that phone call on the historic nature of PRON nomination i never expect to be on this stage four year ago so i know the feeling but the reality be we ve get an election before the american people in the midst of this challenging year and the stake have never be high but i think the choice have never be here susan susan well look i respect the fact that joe biden spend year in public life i respect PRON public service as well the american people have a president who be a businessman he be a job creator who pay ten of million of dollar in taxis payroll taxis property taxis he create ten of thousand of american job and the president say those public report be not accurate and the president also release literally stack of financial disclosure the american people can review just as the law allow but the distinction here be that joe biden year in public service compare to president donald trump who bring all of that experience four year ago and turn this economy around by cut taxis roll back regulations unleash american energy fight for free and fair trade and all of that be on the line if joe biden and kamala harris be elect when president trump and i take office america have go through the slow economic recovery since the great depression PRON be when joe biden be vice president PRON try to tax and spend and regulate and bail PRON way back to a grow economy president trump cut taxis across the board despite what senator harris say the average american family of four have $ in saving in taxis and with the rise in wage that occur most predominantly for blue collar hardworke americans the average household income for a family of four increase by $ follow president trump tax cut but america PRON just hear senator harris tell PRON on day one joe biden be go to raise PRON taxis it be really remarkable to think i mean right after a time where we re go through a pandemic that lose million job at the height we ve already add back million job because PRON have a president who cut taxis roll back regulation unleashed american energy fight for free and fair trade and secure four trillion dollar from the congress of the united states to give direct payment to family save million job through the paycheck protection program PRON literally have spare no expense to help the american people and the american worker through this joe biden and kamala harris want to raise taxis PRON want to bury PRON economy under a two trillion dollar green new deal which PRON be one of the original co sponsor of in the united states senate PRON want to abolish silence the american comeback be on the ballot with four more year of growth and opportunity and four more year of president donald trump be go to be the big economic year in the history of this country PRON say he be go to repeal the trump tax cut the important inaudible be PRON say the truth joe biden have say PRON twice in the debate last week that he be go to repeal the trump tax cut that be tax cut that give the average work family $ in a tax break every single year senator that be the math be PRON the only go to repeal part of the trump tax cut please susan please crosstalk yes but PRON need to give vice president pence PRON time well i hope PRON have a chance to talk about healthcare because obamacare be a disaster and the american people remember PRON well and president trump and i have a plan to improve healthcare and protect preexisting condition for every american but look senator harris you re entitled to PRON own opinion but you re not entitled to PRON own fact PRON PRON say on multiple occasion when PRON be run for president that PRON would ban fracke joe biden look at a supporter in the eye and point and say i guarantee i guarantee that PRON will abolish fossil fuel PRON have a $ trillion version of the green new deal susan that PRON newspaper usa today say really wasn t that very different from the original green new deal more taxis more regulation ban fracking abolish fossil fuel crush american energy and economic surrender to china be a prescription for economic decline president trump and i will keep america grow the v shape recovery that underway right now will continue with four more year of president donald trump crosstalk thank PRON susan well first i m very proud of PRON record on the environment on conservation accord to all of the good estimate PRON air and land be clean than any time ever record PRON water be among the clean in the world and just a little while ago the president sign the outdoors act it be the large investment in PRON public land and public park in year so president trump have make a commitment to conservation and to the environment now with regard to climate change the climate be change but the issue be what be the cause and what do PRON do about PRON president trump have make PRON clear that we re go to continue to listen to the science now joe biden and kamala harris would put PRON back in the paris climate accord they d impose the green new deal which would crush american energy would increase the energy cost of american family in PRON home and literally would crush american job and president trump and i believe that the progress that PRON have make in a clean environment have be happen precisely because PRON have a strong free market economy what be remarkable be the united states have reduce co more than the country that be still in the paris climate accord but we ve do PRON through innovation and we ve do PRON through natural gas and fracking which senator the american people can go look at the record i know joe biden say otherwise now as PRON do but the both of PRON repeatedly commit to abolish fossil fuel and ban of fracke and so by create the kind of american innovation we re actually steer toward a strong and well environment with regard to wildfire president trump and i believe that forest management have to be front and center and even governor gavin newsom from PRON state have agree we ve get to work on forest management and with regard to hurricane the national oceanic administration tell PRON that actually as difficult as PRON be there be no more hurricane today than there be year ago but many of the climate alarmists use hurricane and wildfire to try and sell the good of a green new deal and president trump and i be go to always put american job and american worker first as i say susan the climate be change we ll follow the science but once again senator harris be deny the fact that they re go to raise taxis on every american joe biden say twice in the debate last week as i say susan the climate be change we ll follow the science but once again senator harris be deny the fact that they re go to raise taxis on every american joe biden say twice in the debate last week that on day one PRON be go to repeal the trump tax cut those tax cut deliver $ in tax relief to the average family of four across america and with regard to ban fracking i just recommend that people look at the record PRON PRON say repeatedly that PRON would ban fracke PRON be the first senate co sponsor of the green new deal and while joe biden deny the green new deal susan thank PRON for point out the green new deal be on PRON campaign website and as usa today say it be essentially the same plan as PRON co sponsor with aoc when PRON submit PRON in the senate and PRON just hear the senator say that she be go to resubmit america to the paris climate accord look the american people have always cherish PRON environment and will continue to cherish PRON we ve make great progress reduce co emission through american innovation and the development of natural gas through fracke PRON don t need a massive $ trillion green new deal that would impose all new mandate on american business and american family joe biden want PRON to retrofit four million business building PRON make no sense PRON will cost job president trump he be go to put america first he be go to put job first and we re go to take care of PRON environment and follow the science well i d love to respond look lose the trade war with china joe biden never fight PRON joe biden have be a cheerleader for communist china over the last several decade and again senator harris you re entitle to PRON opinion you re not entitled to PRON own fact when joe biden be vice president PRON lose manufacturing job and president obama say PRON be never come back PRON say PRON need a magic wand to bring PRON back in PRON first three year after PRON cut taxes roll back regulation unleashed american energy this administration see manufacturing job create and that be exactly the kind of growth we re go to continue to see as PRON bring PRON nation through this pandemic a green new deal you re pass new mandate PRON paris climate accord it be go to kill job this time just like PRON kill jobs second and then PRON move on thank PRON susan well before i leave that let PRON speak to voting record if i can everybody know that nafta cost literally thousand of american factory to close PRON see automotive job go south of the border president trump fight to renegotiate nafta in the united states mexico and canada the agreement be now the law of the land american people deserve to know senator kamala harris be one of only member of the senate to vote against the usmca PRON be a huge win for american auto worker PRON be a huge win for american farmer especially dairy in the upper midwest but senator PRON say PRON didn t go far enough on climate change PRON put PRON radical environmental agenda ahead of american auto worker and a head of american job i think the american people deserve to know that it be probably why newsweek magazine say that kamala harris be the most liberal member of the united states senate in more liberal than bernie sander more liberal than any of the other in the united states senate so now with regard to china susan first and foremost china be to blame for the coronavirus and president trump be not happy about PRON he make that very clear make PRON clear again today that china and the world health organization do not play straight with the american people PRON do not let PRON personnel into china to get information on the coronavirus until the middle of february fortunately president trump in deal with china from the outset of this administration stand up to china that have be take advantage of america for decade in the wake of joe biden be cheerlead for china president trump make that decision before the end of january to suspend all travel from china and again the american people deserve to know joe biden oppose president trump decision to suspend all travel from china PRON say PRON be hysterical PRON say PRON was the president trump have stand up to china we re go to continue to stand strong PRON want to improve the relationship but we re go to level the play field and we re go to hold china accountable for what PRON do to america with the coronavirus not true thank PRON well president trump keep PRON word when PRON move the american embassy to jerusalem the capital of the state of israel when joe biden be vice president PRON promise to do that and PRON never do PRON stand strong with PRON ally but we ve be demand nato be now contribute more to PRON common defense than ever before thank to president trump leadership we ve strengthen PRON alliance across the asia pacific and we ve stand strong against those who would do PRON harm when president trump come into office isis have capture an area of the middle east the size of pennsylvania but president trump unleash the american military and PRON armed force destroy the isis caliphate and take down PRON leader al baghdadi without one american casualty al baghdadi be responsible for the death of thousand but notably america heart today be with the family of kayla mueller PRON parent which be here with PRON tonight in salt lake city today two of the isis killer responsible for kayla mueller murder be bring to justice in the united states jihadi john be kill on the battlefield along with the other beetle the reality be that when joe biden be vice president PRON have an opportunity to save kayla mueller break PRON heart to reflect on PRON but the military come into the oval office present a plan PRON say PRON know where kayla be baghdadi have hold PRON for month abuse or mercilessly before PRON kill PRON but when joe biden be vice president PRON hesitate for a month and when armed force finally go in PRON be clear she d be move two day earlier and PRON family say with a heart that break the heart of every american that if president donald trump have be president PRON believe kayla would be alive today so if PRON destroy the isis caliphate and PRON talk about re enter the iran nuclear deal i mean the last administration transfer $ billion to the lead state sponsor of terrorism president donald trump get PRON out of the deal and when qassem soleimani be travel to baghdad to do harm to americans president donald trump take PRON out and america be safe PRON ally be safe and the american people know president donald trump will never take action crosstalk i really have to respond to that PRON has well i ve get to have more then that look slander against president donald trump regard man and woman of PRON armed force be absurd PRON son be in captain in the united states marine corps PRON son in law deploy in the united states navy i can assure all of PRON with son and daughter serve in PRON military president donald trump not only respect but revere all of those who serve in PRON armed force and any suggestion otherwise be ridiculous let PRON also say the american people deserve to know joe biden crosstalk go right ahead well thank PRON for the question but i ll use a little bit of PRON time to respond to that very important issue before the american people deserve to know qassem soleimani the iranian general be responsible for the death of hundred of american service member when the opportunity come PRON see PRON head to baghdad to kill more americans president trump didn t hesitate and qassem soleimani be go but PRON deserve to know the joe biden and kamala harris actually criticize the decision to take out qassem soleimani it be really inexplicably but with regard to joe biden it explainable because history record a joe biden actually oppose the raid against a osama bin ladin it be absolutely essential that PRON have a commander in chief who will not hesitate to act to protect american life and to protect american service member and that be what PRON have in president donald trump now with regard to the supreme court silence become justice amy coney barrett and she be a brilliant woman and PRON will bring a lifetime of experience and a sizeable american family to the supreme court of the united states and PRON hope be in the hearing next week unlike justice cavenaugh receive with treatment from PRON and other that PRON hope PRON get a fair hearing and PRON particularly hope that PRON don t see the kind of attack on PRON christian faith that PRON see before i mean the democrat chairman of the judiciary committee before when judge barrett be be confirm for the court of appeal express concern that the dogma of PRON faith live loudly and PRON and dick durbin of illinois say that PRON be a concern senator i know one of PRON judicial nominee PRON actually attack because PRON be a member of the catholic knights of columbus just because the knight of columbus hold pro life views and crosstalk so PRON hope be that when the hearing take place that that judge amy coney barrett will be respectfully vote and confirm into the supreme court of the united states well thank PRON susan but let PRON just say address PRON very first question i couldn t be more proud to serve as vice president to a president who stand without apology for the sanctity of human life i m pro life i don t apologize for PRON and this be another one of those case where there such a dramatic contrast joe biden and kamala harris support taxpayer funding of abortion all the way up to the moment of birth late term abortion PRON want to increase funding to plan parenthood of america for PRON part i would never presume how judge amy coney barrett would rule on the supreme court of the united states but we ll continue to stand strong for the right to life when PRON speak about the supreme court though i think the american people really deserve an answer senator harris be PRON and joe biden go to pack the court if judge amy coney barrett be confirm i mean there ve be vacancy on the supreme court during presidential election year from george washington to barack obama president have nominate in all case but PRON party be actually openly advocate add seat to the supreme court which have have nine seat for year if PRON don t get PRON way this be a classic case of if PRON can t win by the rule you re go to change the rule now you ve refuse to answer the question joe biden have refuse to answer the question no you ve refuse to answer the question joe biden have refuse to answer the question so i think the american people would really like to know if judge amy coney barrett be confirm at the supreme court of the united states be PRON and joe biden if somehow PRON win this election go to pack the supreme court to get PRON way no i d like PRON to answer the question people susan be vote right now they d like to know if PRON and joe biden be go to pack the supreme court if PRON don t get PRON way in this nomination PRON once again give a non answer joe biden give a non answer PRON know the people deserve a straight answer and if PRON haven t figure PRON out yet the straight answer be PRON be go to pack the supreme court if PRON somehow win this election man and woman i get to tell PRON people across this country if PRON cherish PRON supreme court if PRON cherish the separation of power PRON need to reject the biden harris ticket come november the third reelect president donald trump and we ll stand by that separation power in a nine seat supreme court please i just want the record to reflect PRON never answer the question maybe in the next debate joe biden will answer the question but i think the american people know the answer well PRON heart break for the loss of any innocent american life and the family of breonna taylor have PRON sympathy but i trust PRON justice system a grand jury that refuse the evidence and PRON really be remarkable that as a former prosecutor PRON would assume that an impanel grand jury look at all the evidence get PRON wrong but you re entitled to PRON opinion senator i think and with regard to george floyd there be no excuse for what happen to george floyd justice will be serve but there be also no excuse for the rioting and looting that follow i mean PRON really be astonishing flora westbrook be with PRON here tonight in salt lake city just a few week ago i stand at what use to be PRON salon PRON be burn to the ground by rioter and looter and flora be still try to put PRON life back together and i must tell PRON this presumption that PRON hear consistently from joe biden and kamala harris that america be systemically racist and that as joe biden say that PRON believe that law enforcement have an implicit bias against minority be a great insult to the man and woman who serve in law enforcement and i want everyone to know who put on the uniform of law enforcement every day president trump and i stand with PRON and PRON be remarkable that when senator tim scott try to pass a police reform bill bring together a group of republicans and democrats senator harris PRON get up and walk out of the room and then PRON filibuster senator tim scott bill on the senate floor that would have provide new accountability new repeat resource PRON don t have to choose between support law enforcement prove public safety and support PRON african american neighbor and all of PRON minority under president trump leadership we ll always stand with law enforcement and we ll do what we ve done from day one PRON be improve the life of african americans record unemployment record investment in education we ll fight for school choice for all of crosstalk not not true thank PRON susan i appreciate that very much i think this be one of the thing that make people dislike the medium so much in this country susan be that PRON selectively edit just like senator harris do comment that president trump and i and other on PRON side make i mean senator harris conveniently admit after the president make comment about people on either side of the debate over monument PRON condemn the kkk neo nazis and white supremacist and have do so repeatedly you re concern that PRON doesn t condemn neo nazis president trump have jewish grandchild PRON daughter and son in law be jewish this be a president who respect and cherishe all of the american people but PRON talk about have personally prosecute i m glad PRON bring up PRON record senator i really need to make this point when PRON be da in san francisco when PRON leave office african americans be time more likely to be prosecute for minor drug offense than white and hispanic when PRON be attorney general of california PRON increase the disproportionate incarceration of black in california PRON do nothing on criminal justice reform in california PRON didn t lift a finger to pass the first step back on capitol hill i mean the reality be PRON record speak for PRON president trump and i have fight for criminal justice before PRON fight for educational choice and opportunity for african americans and all of PRON member and we ll do PRON for four more year well susan first and foremost i think we re go to win this election because while joe biden and kamala harris rattle off a long litany of the establishment in washington dc and establishment that joe biden be be a part of for year president donald trump have as launch a movement of everyday americans from every walk of life and i have every confidence that the same americans that deliver that historic victory in PRON see this president record where PRON rebuild PRON military PRON revive PRON economy through tax cut and roll back regulation fight for fair trade unleash american energy PRON appoint conservative to PRON federal court at every level and PRON stand with the man and woman of law enforcement every single day and i think that movement of americans have only grow strong in the last four year but when PRON talk about accept the outcome of the election i must tell PRON senator PRON party have spend the last three and a half year try to overturn the result of the last election it be amazing when joe biden be vice president of the united states the fbi actually spy on president trump and PRON campaign i mean there be document release this week that the cia actually make a referral to the fbi document that those allegation be come from the hillary clinton campaign and of course we ve all see the avalanche what PRON put the country through for the well part of three year until PRON be find that there be no obstruction no collusion case close and then senator harris PRON and PRON colleague in the congress try to impeach the president of the united states over a phone call and now hillary clinton have actually say to joe biden that in PRON word under no circumstance should PRON concede the election so let PRON just say i think we re go to win this election president trump and i be fight every day in courthouse to prevent joe biden and kamala harris from change the rule and create this universal mail in vote that ll create a massive opportunity for voter fraud and PRON have a free and fair election PRON know we re go to have confidence in PRON and i believe in all PRON heart that president donald trump be go to be reelect for four more year brecklin it be a wonderful question and let PRON just commend PRON for take an interest in public life i start follow the news when i be very young and in america PRON believe in a free and open exchange of debate and PRON celebrate that it be how we ve create literally the free and most prosperous nation in the history of the world i would tell PRON that don t assume that what you re see on PRON local news network be synonymous with the american people i look at the relationship between justice ruth bader ginsberg the late justice who PRON just lose from the supreme court and the late justice antonin scalia PRON be on polar opposite on the supreme court of the united states one very liberal one very conservative but what be be learn since PRON passing be the two of PRON and PRON family be the very close of friend here in america PRON can disagree PRON can debate vigorously as senator harris and i have on this stage tonight but when the debate be over PRON come together as americans and that be what people do in big city and small town all across this country so i just want to encourage PRON brecklin i want to tell PRON that we re go to work every day to have government as good as PRON people and the american people each and every day love a good debate PRON love a good argument but PRON always come together and be always there for one another in time of need and we ve especially learn that through the difficulty of this year

123,zb6x9zCKM3Q,pence,2020-10-10T18:25:43Z,"WATCH Full Speech: Vice President Mike Pence hosts a ""Latinos for Trump"" event in Orlando.",speech,[Applause] [Music] peace [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Applause] [Music] president juan carlos amnesty his wonderful daughter carlina for the students and faculty here at central christian university state committee woman debbie galvin my fellow americans it is great to be back in the sunshine state with some great americans who are going to drive a victory here in florida and all across america thank you latinos for trump i love it i love it because i'm here for one reason and one reason only is it florida and america need four more years of president donald trump in the white house it's on and the road to victory runs right through florida [Applause] it really is great to be with you all and if you've got a seat you can take it you know i don't know if you all got to see it but uh i was just in utah the other night we had a little debate with [Music] [Applause] [Music] that debate was not just a debate between two candidates for vice president it was a debate between two visions for america joe biden and kamala harris want higher taxes open borders socialized medicine they want to abolish fossil fuels use taxpayer funding to pay for abortion right they want to defund the police and pack the supreme court [Applause] president donald trump's vision for america is a little bit different president trump has rebuilt our military we've cut taxes we roll back regulation unleash american energy secured our border supported law enforcement life and liberty and the constitution of the united states you know when you compare the biden harris agenda with our agenda the choice is clear if you cherish faith and freedom and law and order and life we need four more years of president donald trump in the white house you know it's amazing to think how far we've come four years ago we inherited a military that had been hollowed out by devastating budget cuts an economy struggling to break out of the worst recession or the worst recovery since the great depression terrorism was on the rise around the world we witnessed a steady assault on our most cherished value but in three short years we rebuilt our military we restored the arsenal democracy and as the proud father of a united states marine and the father-in-law of a navy pilot i couldn't be more proud to tell you we are finally giving our soldiers sailors airmen marines and coast guard and space force the support that they need to defend this nation and that's just what we've done we stood strong for freedom our armed forces have defended this nation we stood with our allies and stood up to our enemies and under president donald trump we have stood for freedom across this hemisphere for all the freedom-loving people under president trump's leadership the united states was the first nation on earth to recognize president juan guaydal as the only legitimate president of venezuela and under this president america has been clear maduro must go and america will stand with the people of venezuela [Music] and until joe biden as vice president served in a time when america was appeasing the communist regime in havana president donald trump kept the promise that he made to cuban americans when he reversed the failed policies of the last administration toward cuba in this white house it will always be que viva cuba libre so we stood for those who serve and we've stood for freedom in this hemisphere of freedom and we've stood every day with all the men and women who have worn the uniform of the united states of america after years of scandal when joe biden was vice president years of scandal at the va that literally saw veterans perishing as they waited care president donald trump has passed the most sweeping reforms of the va in 50 years we have fired thousands of employees that were not providing the care and veterans choice is now available for every veteran in america i have to tell you i can see already that there are some heroes in our midst if you're able if you wore the uniform of the united states would you mind either standing or raising your hand and giving us a chance to say thank you one more time [Music] so we didn't just rebuild our military i'm proud to report to all of you sitting out in the sun and i don't know who set up this arrangement i i'd be happy to be out in the sun here i'm ready to i'm ready to take the heat to drive a victory we didn't just rebuild our military but this president from day one revived our economy in our first three years we turned this economy around where joe biden wants to raise taxes president trump cut taxes across the board for working families and businesses we roll back more federal red tape in our first three years than any administration in american history we unleashed american energy we fought for free and fair trade and in just three short years businesses large and small created seven million good paying jobs including 500 000 jobs right here in the sunshine state florida saw its lowest unemployment rate in history 2.8 percent and most important to the president of me we saw wages rising across the board and wages are rising most rapidly for hard-working blue-collar americans as i stand here at this latinos for trump gathering i'm proud to report to you under this president's leadership in those first three years we achieve the lowest unemployment ever recorded for hispanic americans trump latinos been a champion of jobs and opportunity for latino americans you know during this national hispanic heritage month as president trump said we know latinos embody the very best of america's values commitment to faith family hard work and the american dream this past summer the president established what we call the white house hispanic prosperity initiative to continue to build on the momentum that we've made over the last three and a half years you know when joe biden was vice president less than half of hispanics owned their own home but under president donald trump hispanic home ownership has increased by 11 percent and more than half of hispanics in america are now home owners we've also created nearly 9 000 opportunity zones all across america that are lifting many minorities out of poverty will have a direct impact on more than 400 000 hispanics and right here in florida 1.9 million people live in one of the 427 opportunity zones that are attracting billions of dollars of investment that are going to create jobs in our communities all across the state and here in florida where you have the largest school choice program in the country and 38 of the participants are hispanic americans you all deserve to know joe biden and kamala harris would end school choice they want to shut down charter but i schools you president donald trump and i believe that every parent should be able to choose where their children go to school regardless of their income and their area and we're gonna fight for more school choice for four more years and the results have been incredible in our first three years hispanics enjoyed record high graduation rates across the country and record low poverty rates in fact since 2016 more than a million hispanic children have been lifted out of poverty and nearly half of the jobs that were created in our first three years went to hispanic americans that's what we call promises made and promises so i'm excited to talk to you about that right and see the enthusiasm today on this cool and breezy day in florida [Applause] and you are out here today because this president has been keeping his promise and it's also probably why puerto rico governor wanda vasquez garcia just endorsed president donald trump as president of the united states [Applause] this week the governor of puerto rico asked people to in that territory to vote for the person who's been there for puerto rico in its most difficult moments she said very plainly it is donald trump she thanked the president for rebuilding puerto rico not just with words but with actions and she said thanks to the president's leadership pharmaceutical manufacturing is coming back to the island china is fired and puerto rico so for hispanic americans and every american of every background we need to re-elect president donald trump for four more [Applause] stood for our national defense we delivered on jobs in those first three years and president donald trump has stood every day for the rule of law as i stand before you today this president has seen more than 230 conservative judges appointed to our courts at every level and they are all men and women who will uphold the god-given liberties enshrined in our constitution like the freedom of religion the freedom of speech and the second amendment right keep and bear on now last month as a nation we pause to honor the life and service of the late justice ruth bader ginsburg but when the memorials were over president trump fulfilled his duty under the constitution of the united states and he nominated a principled brilliant conservative woman who loves the constitution to the supreme court he nominated judge amy connie barron [Applause] well let me make you promise after the senate gets done advising and consenting we're going to fill that seat i'm going to tell you i'm a big fan of judge amy coney barrett and not just because she's from indiana but because she is truly a remarkable person and she deserves a dignified hero a dignified and respectful hearing in the united states senate but men and women we have reason to be concerned you all remember when she was concerned to the court of appeals just two short years ago the democrat chairman of the judiciary committee criticized her catholic faith senator dianne feinstein said quote the dogma lives loudly within you and hollywood elites have already begun to criticize judge barrett and her family for their faith well i got news for the democrats and their friends in hollywood that dogma lives loudly in me lives loudly in you and the right to live to work to worship according to the dictates of our faith lives loudly in the constitution of the united states of america and these attacks on judge amy coney barrett's faith must stop so the senate has a job to do and they'll be about it next week but i thank you for your strong support and i want to thank both of the great senators from the state of florida who have been there every step of the way the president donald trump has stood every day for the rule of law and this president has stood with the men and women who serve on the thin blue line of law enforcement and we always will now you all know you all know what the president and i know the men and women who serve in law enforcement are some of the best people in this country and i know people at this latinos for trump gathering are proud that hispanic americans serve in law enforcement at every level and half of our border agents in america are hispanic americans and those who serve in law enforcement deserve the respect of every american every single day now the president and i will always support the right of americans to peaceful protest it's enshrined in our constitution but rioting and looting is not peaceful protest burning businesses is not free speech violence against innocent civilians the destruction of property or violence against law enforcement will not be tolerated and those who do these things will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law now for months all joe biden talked about was peaceful protesters as the american people watched businesses and cities around the country literally burned to the ground i had a guest at the debate last week flora westbrook she started a business in minneapolis 35 years ago she served the african-american community with great pride she told me the story about how just two days after the killing of george floyd she watched as the protesters were closer and closer and closer to her business until the night they burned her out but i spoke to floor again yesterday she's back home in minneapolis and i told her america is with you flora and we are going to re-build bigger and better than ever before you know the truth is joe biden would double down on the very policies that have led to violence in our major cities i mean when you start to withdraw support from those who protect and serve you only emboldened those who would do harm to our families now joe biden explains it all by saying that quote america is systemically racist and he even said as kamala harris said in our debate the other night that police have a quote implicit bias against minorities joe was asked if he supported cutting funding to law enforcement he said yes absolutely and his running mate recently applauded the decision by the mayor of los angeles to cut 150 million dollars from the police budget well i'll make you promise under president donald trump we're not gonna defund the police not now not ever we're going to back the blue i mean president trump and i know what you all know we don't have to choose between supporting law enforcement and supporting our african-american neighbors our hispanic american neighbors or any of the families that live in our major cities we have done both for the last three and a half years and we're going to keep doing both for four more years we're going to have law and order in every city for every american regardless of race or creed or color so help me god [Applause] so we've stood for the rule of law for law and order and from day one i'm proud to report here at central christian university president donald trump has stood every day for the religious freedom of every american of every faith from early on in this administration our president has reaffirmed our commitment to our first freedom he took action to protect the conscience rights of doctors and nurses and teachers and religious charities and president donald trump ended the assault of the last administration on the little sisters of the poor and not long ago the supreme court of the united states made it permanent by a 7-2 vote now you all deserve to know that when when joe biden was vice president the last administration literally hauled the little sisters of the poor into federal court to force them to compromise their faith to live under the new mandates of obamacare but under this president i promise you we've stood for religious liberty every single day and we're going to keep standing for the freedom of religion of every american of every faith for four more years and as we speak about our values i can't tell you how proud i am to serve as vice president to a president who stands without apology for the sanctity of human life president donald trump is the most pro-life president in american history so we've rebuilt our military revived our economy stood for law and order our liberties and life and in three short years with the strong support of latinos for trump we made america great again it's true and then the coronavirus struck from china but i'm here to tell you when there were just five cases of the coronavirus in the united states in late january president donald trump did what no other american president had ever done when he suspended all travel from china the second largest economy in the world he put the health of america first now joe biden said that was quote hysterical and xenophobic he actually wrote an editorial in january that said that suspending travel would actually make things worse but i can tell you as head of the white house coronavirus task force president trump's decisive leadership saved untold american lives and it gave us time to stand up the largest national mobilization since world war ii it's the truth we reinvented testing more than 120 million tests done so far we saw to the manufacturer and delivery of hundreds of millions of medical supplies to our incredible doctors and nurses we're developing medicines that are literally saving lives and we're on track today with five different companies in phase three clinical trials we are on track today to have the first safe and effective coronavirus vaccine before the end of this year with tens of millions of doses ready to go and let me say on behalf of the president and the first lady how moved we've all been by the outpouring of concerned and prayers for our first family over the past week i spoke to the president this morning before i came to florida and i can tell you he and the first lady are doing just great but the president and i both feel the outpouring of concern for them was just emblematic of the love and the concern and the care that's been shown all across this country and so to all of those that have been impacted by the coronavirus to families that have suffered loss you'll always be on our hearts and can we just take a moment to say thanks to the doctors the nurses the first responders and everyone who's been there to help the american people through this challenging time they are heroes all people with their help with your help we're slowing the spread we're protecting the vulnerable we'll keep saving lives and we're opening up america again you know with that strong foundation that president trump poured in those first three years with the unprecedented economic recovery support for families and businesses just in the last five months alone after having lost 22 million jobs at the height of this pandemic we've already seen eleven and a half million americans go back to work including 631 000 people right here in florida we're opening up america and we're opening up america's schools i'm proud to report to you that school teacher i married 35 years ago is already back in the classroom and just a few weeks ago we announced that literally we're distributing a hundred million rapid tests to school nurses and school systems around the country so we can get our kids back in the classroom and keep them back in the classroom safe and sound let me just say after a challenging summer here in the sunshine state because the cooperation of these people of the state you've made incredible progress but i want to say from my heart none of that would have been possible without the strong compassionate and steady leadership of governor ron desentis would you join me in thanking governor ron desantis for his great leadership of this state so we've gone through a time of testing but in 24 days we're coming to a time for choosing and that's what brought me here today the choice in this election has never been clear the stakes have never been higher it's amazing to think in the middle of a global pandemic joe biden wants to raise taxes by four trillion dollars president trump we not only cut taxes in our first three years we're going to cut taxes on middle class americans for the next four years joe biden wants to bury our economy under an avalanche of red tape he had to be reminded in that last debate that he supports the green new deal in fact he wants to put us back in the paris climate accord president donald trump he took us out of the paris climate accord he put the jobs and prosperity of america first we cut more red tape than any administration in history and we're going to keep on shopping for four more years and joe biden joe biden's for open borders sanctuary cities president donald trump we've made record investments in border security we've supported our customs and border patrol as never before we've already built more than 300 miles of our border wall and with four more years we're gonna fix this broken immigration system once and for all when it comes to trade the contracts couldn't be more clear as well you know out in the heartland we saw the impact of nafta up close and personal i mean did you know in the 25 years since nafta was signed into law we saw sixty thousand factories close across this country when joe biden was vice president and for all those years in the senate he never lifted a finger to renegotiate it or fix it but thanks to the man who wrote the art of the deal americans got a better deal nafta is gone and the u.s mexico canada agreement is here and it's a win for florida and a win for america [Applause] and where joe biden where joe biden has been a cheerleader for communist china every day president donald trump put china on notice on day one and said the era of economic surrender is over and we will continue to stand strong until china opens their markets to u.s goods and agriculture and respects the private property rights of every american and where joe biden and kamala harris want a government takeover of health care that would put us on an inexorable path to socialize medicine i mean did you see bernie sanders the other day reminded the country that he'll be writing the health care reform if they win the senate i think latinos for trump no better than most we can reform our health care system we can protect pre-existing conditions and we can make sure that america will never be a socialist country the families in florida including the many many that have fled from countries facing tyranny and oppression and socialism know that your voice is more important than ever before and how about maximo at the republican national convention wasn't he amazing he told the story you know when you look at their agenda it's clear joe biden would be nothing more than a trojan horse for the radical left i mean joe biden has said that democracy is on the ballot and i believe our economic recovery is on the ballot i believe law and order are on the ballot but i also think there are things much more fundamental and foundational to our country that are on the ballot in this election i think it's not just whether america will be more conservative or more liberal more republican or more democrat more red or more blue i think the choice in this election is whether america remains america it's whether we allow joe biden and kamala harris to steer our nation on a path of more government and less freedom the path to socialism and decline or whether we'll renew our commitment as a nation to the path of freedom personal responsibility and a boundless american future for men and women for our freedom and for all the ideals that have always made america great we need to decide right here and right now that joe biden will never be president of the united states of america we're going to re-elect president donald trump for four more years [Applause] cuatro indeed [Applause] so i need you to tell your neighbors and friends what four more years means they say i ran into mike i was sitting in the sun and he told me uh to tell you you know four more years means more jobs four more years means more judges four more years means more support for our troops and our cops and you tell them i said it's going to take at least four more years to drain that swamp [Applause] oh we're draining you know four years ago a movement was born a movement of everyday americans from every walk of life here in florida you believe we could be strong again you believe we could be prosperous again you said yes to president donald trump in 2016 and i don't know florida is going to say yes to four more years of president donald trump on november 3rd 2020. but it's going to take all of us it's going to take all of us folks it's on it's time to go to work you know i've i've served alongside this president all of this administration i've only known him for the last four years i love you too [Applause] let me tell you he and i have gotten to be very close friends i mean some people think we're a little bit different but the truth is i've come to see him when the cameras are off and i can tell you firsthand there's never been a day that president donald trump against overwhelming opposition from the democrats and many of their allies in the media there's never been a day that president donald trump hasn't gotten up to fight to keep the promises that he made to all of you and now it's our turn to fight for him it's on florida so i need you to bring this passion bring all your enthusiasm keep voicing your support tell your neighbors and friends all across the sunshine state and all across america and tell all the latinos for trump why we need this president and all he's done for us talk to people at work at worship go out and tell the story you know i honestly believe four years ago when all the polls were saying things were going to go a different way that the american people were talking to one another you know the most powerful media in this country is now and always has been word of mouth and so i want you to remember that there's nothing more powerful than when someone who knows you and respects you hears from you about an issue that you think is important for them and their family in this state in this nation so let your voice be heard and when you speak to your neighbors and friends i'd encourage you to have faith have faith in the american people you know i really do believe a careful study of american history proves that every time the american people have been given a clear choice between more freedom or less freedom the american people choose more freedom every single time so talk to your neighbors and friends and tell them freedom's on the line and our future of freedom in america and finally i'd also encourage you in the 24 days that we have between now and election day standing here at this great christian university if you're inclined to bow the head or bend the knee from time to time i encourage you to do that too you know as president trump often says this is a nation of faith you know the sweetest words the president i ever hear it's traveling all across this country when people will reach out and say i'm praying for you we are we hear it a lot [Applause] and it's caused me to believe as i've traveled the nation that while it looks on television like i told that little girl if you saw it on down in utah this week at the debate i had a question from a little girl that said she was watching television it seemed like all americans to do were arguing anymore i said i'll always believe that there there will always be more that unites us in these united states than could ever divide us in chief among those things is faith and so in these challenging times of too much division in the challenging times as we face that this global pandemic and its aftermath as we rebuild and reopen america i'd just encourage you to pray for america pray for all the american people and when you pray pray with confidence that if his people who are called by his name will humble themselves and pray and turn that he'll do like he's always done in much more challenging times than we could possibly imagine he'll hear from heaven and he'll heal this land this one nation under god indivisible with liberty and justice for all so pray for america for all the american people it'll make a difference so i want to thank you for coming out today and while i'm at it thank you for the privilege of serving as your vice president it's the greatest honor of my life [Music] but i want to be your vice president for four more years but i leave here today with renewed confidence that if all of us do all that we need to do over the next 24 days with your support with your voice to latinos for trump and people all across this great state i know we're going to make florida and america more prosperous than ever before i know we're going to make florida and america safer than ever before and with a renewed republican majority in the united states senate a new republican majority in the house of representatives with president donald trump

comeback every month there's a jobs report every month the media has sold us that it's going to be it's just not going to be all that good and every month they have to put the phrase in it it beat expectations and it's done that every single time it's great so i will tell you this um look our neighborhoods are nuts and the communities are not safe with a joe haydn president our freedoms and our liberties will not survive with the joe hyden president the left-wing mob has and is pushing joe hyden to the way left radical left did you see the debates just like just like uh joe hike yes joe hyde senator harris refused to answer the questions are you going to pack the court with more liberal justices won't answer the question by the way did you see what a great job our vice president mike pence did yes he pushed back on all of the countless false attacks on on him and the president that they were levied he has such a calm winsome spirit and it just took over the debate he did an awesome job well while he shared stories about the trump administration's successes his opponent shared gloom and doom about everything so sad and the rest of it should fill up with uh dodging questions yes and the lives yeah thank you uh one of my favorite moments is when the vice president did not apologize for being pro-life [Music] uh i was president i was privileged to serve with mike pence in the united states congress before he left he left to go and become governor of indiana and then later vice president to know him and know his beloved wife karen is to know two people who live their lives with quiet but firm humility and to seek to serve others and to live out the daily command of his lord which is to love others more than themselves friends and neighbors it is my honor and privilege to introduce to you my friend former congressman former governor and now our vice president mike pence florida oh man the congressman webster all the great families here at the villages my fellow americans it is great to be back in the sunshine state it is great to be back in trump country thank you all for coming out today and what a privilege it is to be here with my friend i heard of congressman daniel webster when he was serving in your state house he was speaker of the house a man of integrity and principle and i can tell you in all my 12 years in the congress and ever since i've never served with someone more committed to conservative principles or a stronger ally of our president and this administration join me in thanking congressman daniel webster for all he's done for florida and for the cause but daniel and i are here for one reason and one reason only and that is that florida and america need four more years of president donald trump in the white house [Applause] it's on everybody and the road to victory runs right through florida it's still good to be with all of you i had a little bit of a busy week i don't know if you got to see it but i was over in utah the other night we had a little debate with kamala harris and [Applause] some people think we did all right [Music] [Applause] you know let me be clear that debate was not just a debate between two candidates for vice president it was a debate between two visions joe biden and kamala harris want higher taxes open borders socialized medicine they want to abolish fossil fuels they want taxpayer funding of abortion they want to defund the police and pack the court president trump's vision we've rebuilt our military we cut taxes we roll back regulations we've unleashed american energy we secured our border supported law enforcement and stood for life liberty and the constitution of the united states i mean when you compare the biden harris agenda with the agenda of president donald trump the choice is clear if you cherish faith freedom law and order and life in 24 days we got to re-elect president donald trump for four more years [Applause] you know four years ago we inherited military hollowed out by devastating budget cuts an economy struggling to break out of the slowest recovery since the great depression terrorism was on the rise and we witnessed a steady assault on our most cherished values but in three short years i'm proud to report as the father of a united states marine and the father-in-law of a united states navy pilot we've rebuilt our military we restored the arsenal of democracy and we are finally given our soldiers sailors airmen marines and coast guard the support they deserve [Applause] you know i couldn't be more proud to serve as vice president to a president who cares so deeply about the men and women of our armed forces and we've stood with those who serve but we've also stood with all of you who have served in the uniform of the united states you know when joe biden was vice president you all remember it we saw years of heartbreaking scandal at the va that shocked the conscience of the nation i mean we literally saw america's heroes perishing in waiting lines to get health services at the va but under president donald trump those days are over our president signed the most sweeping reform of the va in 50 years we fired thousands of va employees that were not giving our veterans the care that they earned in the uniform of the united states and veterans choice is now available for every veteran in america [Applause] you know i know here at the villages there's a lot of you men and women that have served in uniform so if you're able would you just either stand or would you raise your hand in the air and give us a chance to say thank you one more time thank you for your service thank you for your service thank you for your service god bless you you know we didn't just rebuild our military under this president's leadership in our first three years we revived and created the greatest economy the world has ever known where joe biden wants to raise taxes president trump cut taxes across the board for working families and businesses large and small this president actually repealed more federal red tape in our first three years than any administration in american history we unleashed american energy we're now a net exporter of energy for the first time in 70 years and we fought for free and fair trade that puts american jobs and american workers first and in those first three years businesses large and small created more than 7 million good paying jobs including 550 000 jobs right here in the sunshine state so we stood for our national defense and for jobs standing here not far from the space coast i'm proud to report to you under president donald trump we have renewed american leadership in manned space exploration we reconstituted the national space council and the president asked me to be the chairman he didn't actually know that when our kids were little we actually vacationed at cape canaveral just to go see the rockets that my daniel you got to know the only committee i ever asked to be on in the congress was the nasa subcommittee so when he asked me to lead the national space council i i counted an incredible privilege and under this president's leadership we've secured historic funding for nasa and this year we returned american astronauts to space on an american rocket from right here at kennedy space center for the first time in 10 years and under the president's leadership by 2024 we're going to see the next man and the first woman land on moon and then we're headed to mars under president donald trump nasa is back [Applause] and under this president not only we stood for our security for american jobs and for american leadership in space but every single day president donald trump has stood for the rule of law we've appointed more than 200 conservatives to our federal courts at every level and i'm here to tell you they are all principled men and women who will uphold all the god-given liberties in our constitution like the freedom of religion and the freedom of speech and the second amendment right to keep and bear arms now last month we rightly paused as a nation to honor the life and service of justice ruth vader ginsburg but when the memorials were over president trump fulfilled his constitutional duty [Music] and he nominated a principled brilliant conservative woman to the supreme court of the united states of america judge amy coney barrett now i'm uh i'm a big fan of judge barrett and it's not just because she's from indiana i'm telling you what judge amy coney barrett is an inspiring person she's a brilliant and principal jurist she'll do great credit on the supreme court now the confirmation hearings are set for this monday and the american people expect democrats in the senate to give judge barrett a dignified hearing this time but we have reason to be concerned you all remember when judge barrett went through a confirmation two years ago for the court of appeals the democrat chairman of the judiciary committee actually criticized judge barrett for her catholic faith [Music] she said that quote the dogma lives loudly in you and hollywood elites have already begun to criticize judge barrett and her family for their christian faith well i got news for the democrats and their friends in hollywood the dogma lives loudly in me the dogma lives loudly in you and the right to live and work and worship according to the dictates of our conscience lives loudly in the constitution of the united states of america [Applause] in america we cherish the freedom of religion of every american of every faith and these attacks on judge barrett's faith got to stop so after the senate does their job to advise and consent i'll make a prediction judge amy coney barrett is going to be justice amy coney barrett we're going to fill that seat [Applause] oh we're gonna fail you know the american people actually also deserve to know the democrats in washington are actually talking about adding seats to the supreme court in the biggest power grab in american history it's called packing the court now joe biden and kamala harris won't admit it but after 150 years with nine seats on the supreme court of the united states they're planning to pack the court in fact joe biden refused to answer the question in his debate with the president kamala harris refused to ask the question during our debate and just yesterday in nevada joe biden was asked by a reporter if don't voters deserve to know what you do and joe biden replied quote no they don't [Music] well come on joe the american people deserve a straight answer when you're running for the highest office in the land the american people deserve to know whether you're going to respect the highest court in the land you know there's only one explanation by joe biden and kamala harris won't answer the question it's because joe biden and kamala harris want to pack the court but we're not going to let it happen we're going to preserve an independent judiciary we're going to preserve our constitutional order we're going to reelect president donald trump for four more years in the white house [Applause] so we've stood for the rule of law prosperity and security we've stood for an independent judiciary we always will and every single day of this administration president donald trump has stood with the men and women who serve on the thin blue line of law enforcement and we always will that's probably why you have police associations around the country that are endorsing our president's reelection in fact i learned for the first time ever the florida police chief association endorsed president donald trump's re-election [Applause] let me take this opportunity to thank sheriff jeff parson and all the membership of the florida police chief association and also can we just show these law enforcement officers how much we appreciate all they do every day to protect and serve our family you know oh we're back to blue [Applause] you know i like to tell people all my heroes wear uniforms when i was growing up in a small town in indiana we used to drive back to chicago where my parents grew up we'd go to my grandparents house and uh my uncle my uncle would come walking out wearing that police uniform have that sidearm man i got to tell you me and my three brothers just look up at him in awe and you all know the men and women who serve in law enforcement in this country are some of the best people in america and they deserve the respect of every american every single day i do now president trump and i will always support the right of americans to peaceful protest enshrined in the constitution rioting and looting is not peaceful protest burning businesses is not free speech violence against innocent civilians the destruction of property or violence against our police will not be tolerated and those who do these things will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law now for months all joe biden talked about was peaceful protest as the american people watched their businesses and communities literally burn at the debate this week i invited flora westbrook wonderful african-american business owner in minneapolis to join us there flora told me about a few days after the killing of george floyd how the protesters marched closer and closer to her business and then that friday night came and a little salon that she had built 35 years ago was burned to the ground well i talked to flora yesterday and i told her i said flora we are with you today and we are going to rebuild and have law and order in your city and every city in america for every american of every race and creed and color so help us god you know the truth is joe biden would double down on the very policies that have led to violence in america when you undermine support for those who protect and serve you only embolden those who would do violence in our communities now joe biden explains it all by saying that america is quote systemically racist and he and his running mate just the other day have said that police have a quote implicit bias against minorities when joe biden was asked if he cut funding to law enforcement he said yes absolutely and his running mate recently applauded the mayor of los angeles announcement of cutting 150 million dollars from the lapd but let me make your promise under president donald trump we're not going to defund the police not now not ever we're gonna back to blue [Applause] what the president and i know what you all know we don't have to choose between supporting law enforcement and supporting our african-american neighbors or any of the minorities or families who live in our major cities we have done both for the last three and a half years we provided new resources for law enforcement new personnel and we've made historic investments in our african-american historically black colleges and universities we we saw the lowest unemployment ever recorded for african americans 9 000 opportunity zones in our major cities we passed criminal justice reform we have supported law enforcement supported our african-american neighbors and were to keep on doing it for four more years [Applause] so i i just want to thank you all i want to thank you all for being here today as you know we've stood for the rule of law we stood for law and order as i said before we stood strong for the right of every american to live to work to worship according to the dictates of our conscience you know the freedom of religion has been called our first freedom than the first amendment and people of faith have no greater champion than president donald trump true from early on the president took decisive action to restore the conscience rights of doctors and nurses teachers and religious charities and president donald trump ended the last administration's assault on the little sisters of the poor and the supreme court voted seven to two to make it permanent it's amazing to think when joe biden was vice president they actually hauled a group of nuns who had taken a lifetime vow of poverty to serve the neediest among us he hauled them into court to force them to compromise their faith to live under the standards of obamacare and you deserve to know joe biden joe biden recently said that he plans to do it again he plans to reimpose the strictures of obamacare and the little sisters of the poor and other religious institutions in fact his running mate attacked one of our judicial nominees simply because they were a member of the catholic knights of columbus so let me make your promise with four more years of president donald trump in the white house we're going to respect the religious freedom of every american of every faith and we're going to end the assault on religious liberty once and for all so it's been about security it's been about prosperity the rule of law and our liberties and i can't tell you i can't tell you how proud i am to be vice president to a president who stands without apology for the sanctity of human life where joe biden supports taxpayer funding of abortion all the way up to the moment of birth president trump took action early in our administration to suspend all funding the mexico city policy no taxpayer dollars to provide or promote abortion around the world he's renewed the hyde amendment to protect taxpayer money from ever being spent on abortion and president donald trump is the most pro-life president in american history that's true so we've rebuilt our military revived our economy stood up for law order life and liberties and let me just say none of that would have been possible in our first three years without the strong and consistent support of senator rick scott and senator marco rubio and that's also why here in his congressional district we need you to re-elect congressman daniel webster to a new republican majority and retire nancy pelosi once and for all you know when you look at all that we accomplished in those first few years with a republican house and a republican senate there's only one conclusion you can draw in three short years we made america great again and then the coronavirus struck from china i'm here to tell you before the first documented case of community transmission in the united states president trump did what no other american president had ever done before he suspended all travel from china the second largest economy in the world he put the health of america first now now joe biden said that was hysterical he said it was quote xenophobic in fact he wrote in usa today back in january that travel bans would quote make things worse but let me tell you as the head of the white house coronavirus task force i can tell you first hand president trump's decision to suspend all travel from china bought us invaluable time to stand up the greatest national mobilization since world war ii and it saved countless american lives during that time we reinvented testing more than 120 million tests done so far we saw to the manufacturer and delivery of literally billions of medical supplies to our incredible doctors and nurses and health care workers we developed life-saving medicines and i'm here to report that we're on track to have the first safe and effective coronavirus before the end of this year and under operation warp speed we'll have tens of millions of doses available to administer to our most vulnerable you know the president just said on the south lawn of the white house today and i quote through the power of american science and medicine we will eradicate the china virus once and for all and let me say on behalf of the president and the first lady how moved we've all been by the outpouring of prayers and concern for our first family over the last week i spoke to the president this morning before i left for florida and i'm i'm happy to report to you president donald trump and first lady melania are doing great well the president and i knows the outpouring of support and concern and prayer from across the country for our first family is just reflective of the love and the concern and the prayers that americans have shown to neighbors and friends impacted by this virus and especially those impacted by laws so can we just take a moment to give a round of applause for all of the doctors the nurses the health care workers those in ministry everyone that has been there for our families through this challenging time we love you all so as you showed through the sunbelt outbreak this summer here in florida we're showing across the country because of the cooperation of the american people the leadership of our president we're slowing the spread we're protecting the vulnerable and we're saving lives and we're opening up america again [Applause] you know it's amazing to think after losing 22 million jobs at the height of this pandemic in just the last five months because of the foundation that we poured and because of the unprecedented recovery and relief support for families and businesses we've already seen eleven and a half million americans go back to work including six hundred and thirty thousand americans right here in florida we're opening up america and we're opening up america's schools you know about a week ago the president announced we actually acquired about 100 million rapid tests that we're distributing to school nurses and school systems to help get our kids back in the classroom and keep them back in the classroom safe and sound [Applause] and can i just say as i stand here in florida none of the progress this state has made would have been possible without not only the leadership of our president our incredible health care workers but none of it would have been possible without the strong steady and compassionate leadership of governor ron desantis he's done an amazing job thank you governor so we've gone through a time of testing but i came down today on this cool and breezy floor today because in 24 days we're coming to a time for choosing choice in this election has never been clear and the stakes have never been higher it's amazing to think in the middle of a global pandemic joe biden wants to raise taxes by 4 trillion dollars president trump not only has he passed the largest tax cuts and tax reform in history but for four more years we're going to keep cutting taxes for middle class americans and bring this economy all the way back and then some where joe biden wants to bury our economy under an avalanche of red tape he had to be reminded in that presidential debate that he supports the green new deal he wants to put us back in the paris climate accord president trump's been cutting red tape got us out of the paris climate accord our air and land are cleaner than any time in recorded history our water is the cleanest in the world and america is now a net exporter of energy for the first time in nearly 70 years and joe biden's for open borders sanctuary cities free lawyers for illegal immigrants president donald trump made record investments in border security we've already built 300 miles of that border wall on the southern border of the united states and with four more years in the white house we're gonna fix this broken immigration system once and for all in a way that puts america first [Applause] and when it comes to international trade so important here in florida for what you manufacture and what you grow contrast couldn't be clear you know out in the heartland where i grew up we saw the impact of nafta over the last 25 years i literally saw entire communities shuttered factories closed shipped south of the border they were still shipping jobs south of the border before the paint was dry on the last election and joe biden never lifted a finger to reform nafta in a way that put american workers first but thanks to the man who wrote the art of the deal america got a way better deal than nafta the united states mexico canada agreement is here it is a win for florida and a win for america [Applause] and when we came into office half of our international trade deficit was with china we were literally losing 500 billion dollars a year to china in trade joe biden's been a cheerleader for communist china's since day one president trump he put china on notice he said the era of economic surrender is over we impose tariffs and we're going to keep the pressure on until they level the playing field for american workers american businesses and respect american private property [Applause] and where joe biden and kamala harris want a government takeover of health care i mean they're their version of obamacare includes what's something called a public option you heard about it they say then the government insurance would be out there competing with private insurance well i said years ago when we had that debate when i was in congress you know the government competes with the private sector the way an alligator competes with a duck in truth the matter is they would put us on an inexorable path to socialize medicine president trump we're going to reform health care we're going to protect pre-existing conditions we're going to lower the cost of health insurance without growing the size of government we're going to harness the power of the private sector and make sure that america is never a socialist country on health care or anything else you know when you look at their agenda it's clear joe biden would be nothing more than a trojan horse for the radical left now joe biden has said that democracy is on the ballot well i think our economic recovery is on the ballot law and order are on the ballot but so are things far more foundational to our country from the number of people nodding your heads i think you get this election is not going to decide whether america is more conservative or more liberal whether more republican or more democrat more red or more blue i think the choice in this election is whether america remains america whether we're going to allow joe biden and kamala harris to steer our nation on a path of more government less freedom and less opportunity the path that ultimately leads to socialism and decline or whether we're going to steer our nation in a renewed way on a path of freedom individual responsibility and all the ideals that have made this country great so for our freedom for our highest ideals we need to decide right here and right now that joe biden will never be president of the united states of america we're going to re-elect president donald trump for four more years [Applause] so i need you to tell your neighbors and friends what four more years means say i was over in a parking lot of the villages the other day i ran into mike and he told me to tell you four more years means more jobs four more years means more judges four more years means more support for our troops [Applause] four more years means more support for our police and it's going to take at least four more years to drain that swamp oh we're draining it you know four years ago a movement was born a movement of everyday americans from every walk of life here in florida you believe we could be prosperous again you believe we could be strong again you believe we could be respected again you said yes to president donald trump in 2016 and i know florida's going to say yes to four more years of president donald trump in 2020 but it's going to take all of us to do it [Applause] let me tell you let me hang on one second here is she okay okay you got her take a minute [Applause] thank you for coming out there you know i've known this president over the last four years some people think we're a little bit different but we've gotten to be very close friends i've seen him when the cameras are off and i'm going to tell you folks there's never been a day gone by in the last three and a half years that president donald trump hasn't gotten up and fought to keep the promises that he made to the people of florida and the people of america now it's our turn to fight for him it's on 24 days to make the case so keep bringing all your enthusiasm keep voicing your support keep telling your neighbors and friends across the sunshine state and all across the country all that we've accomplished talk to them at work and at worship go out and tell the story the way you did in 2016. you know i'll never forget i was on one of those sunday morning shows just before the election four years ago and all the polls said that the president was going to lose right and hillary clinton was already announcing who her cabinet picks were you remember they were measuring the curtains in the oval office and i'll never forget i was on one of the shows and the host looked at me and he asked almost in a sympathetic tone he said what do you think's gonna happen and i looked at him and i said i think we're gonna win and he he was a little shocked really he like said to me why and i said well because i might look i don't care about the polls only one poll that matters and the fact was i was out traveling around the country the president was traveling around the country and he'll be back on the road here in florida come monday [Applause] get ready but i said he was traveling around the country drawing tens of thousands of people and i was traveling drawing literally hundreds of americans [Laughter] but it was all the same people and i'm [Applause] but it was i said to this host i said all i can tell you is what i'm seeing across the country every time i look across a rope line every time i i wave from the car every time i have a chance to stop and talk to people i said the american people just knew they heard the vision this president had of a strong and prosperous america they heard his distinctly american leadership they heard those leadership qualities coming through and they were talking to one another i just knew it they were turning down the sound on the tv not listening to the commentators and the pundits and just and they were remembering you know the most powerful media in america is not your major television networks it's not your big newspapers not even your social media the most powerful media in america is word of mouth it's when it's when when the american people hear from you it's they hear what what what you believe in your heart of hearts is important to them and their family and the state and the nation so i encourage you just go out and let your voice be heard and when you're speaking be speak boldly and confidently because i'm going to tell you something this is a freedom loving nation and you go talk to your neighbors and friends your republicans your independence your democrats and you tell them that freedom is on the ballot and i truly do believe a study of american history shows every time the american people have been given a clear choice between a future built on more freedom and a future built unless freedom the american people choose a future of freedom every single time so have faith in your neighbors and friends and go out and talk to them about the choice we face and lastly in the days now between now and the election if you're inclined to exercise that other kind of faith i encourage you to do that too you know the sweetest words the president and i ever hear when we're traveling around the country is when people look out reach across a rope line maybe put the hand next to their cheek and just say i'm praying for you [Music] and we hear it a lot everywhere i've gone the last four years traveling around this country i i'm convinced of two things this is a freedom loving nation and this is a nation of faith and so and so in the 24 days we have between now and election day as you let your voice be heard as you help tell our story you make sure to get out and vote and all your neighbors and friends get out and vote if you're inclined to bow the head and bend the knee i encourage you to do that too and when you pray pray with confidence that if his people who are called by his name will humble themselves and pray and turn he'll do like he's always done in the long and storied history of this nation he'll hear from heaven and he'll heal this land this one nation under god indivisible with liberty and justice for all so pray for america pray for all the american people it'll make a difference so i want to thank you all for coming out again today and i want to thank you for the great privilege of being your vice president these last three and a half years the greatest honor of my life but i'm absolutely convinced if all of us do all that we need to do between now and november 3rd we work like it depended on us and and we pray that we're going to have a great american victory on november 3rd we're going to make florida and america stronger than ever before we're going to make florida and america more prosperous than ever before and with rick scott and marco rubio in a renewed republican majority in the senate with daniel webster in a new republican majority in the house of representatives with

HE WAS AN ARMY VETERAN WHO JUST COME BACK FROM WORLD WAR TWO THE SON OF AN IMMIGRANT. COALMINER LITERALLY WALK TO COLUMBUS FROM THE MINDS OF WESTERN PENNSYLVANIA. NEXT AVVO BUILDER THING THAT MATTERS. THE FAMILY BUSINESS AND A GOOD NIGHT THE LIVE THE AMERICAN DREAM. BUT TODAY WE'RE JOINED BY ONE WITHOUT HIM NONE OF THAT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE.

THANK YOU JOEL TO THANK YOU FOR YOU AND YOUR EXAMPLE YOUR FAMILY WERE SO INSPIRED. SO WE STOOD FOR OUR NATIONAL DEFENSE FOR VETERANS. AND FOR JOBS AND OPPORTUNITIES THIS IS JUST LIKE THIS. AND PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP IS STOOD EVERY DAY FOR THE RULE OF LAW WE'VE APPOINTED MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED CONSERVATIVES TO OUR FEDERAL COURTS AT EVERY LEVEL AND THEY'RE ALL MEN AND WOMEN. WILL UPHOLD ALL THE GOD GIVEN LIBERTIES IN OUR CONSTITUTION LIKE THE FREEDOM OF RELIGION THE FREEDOM OF SPEECH AND THE SECOND OF MAY RIGHT TO KEEP AND BEAR ARMS. NOW LAST MONTH WE RIGHTLY PAUSE AS A NATION. UNDER THE LIFE IN SERVICE OF THE LATE JUSTICE RUTH BADER GINSBURG. BUT WITH THE MEMORIALS WERE OVER. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP FULFILLED HIS DUTY UNDER THE CONSTITUTION. ANY NOMINATED AN EXTRAORDINARY PRINCIPLED CONSERVATIVE WOMAN TO THE SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES JUDGE AMY CONEY BARRETT. NOW THE SENATE STARTED THEIR CONFIRMATION HEARINGS THIS MORNING. ALL THE SENATORS WERE DOING THEIR OPENING REMARKS. QUESTIONING PROBABLY START TOMORROW. THE PRESIDENT SAID. DEMOCRATS ON THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE. NEED TO GET JUDGE BAIRD A RESPECTFUL AND DIGNIFIED HEARING THIS TALK. BUT WE HAVE REASON TO BE CONCERNED. YOU'LL REMEMBER THE ATTACKS ON JUDGE BAIRD'S FACE WHEN SHE WAS CONFIRMED TO THE COURT OF APPEALS JUST TWO YEARS AGO. DEMOCRATS IN THEIR HOLLYWOOD FRIENDS HAVE ALREADY STARTED TO TECH JUDGE AMY CONEY BARRETT'S CHRISTIAN THINGS AS WELL. THIS TIME AROUND. YOU KNOW BACK THEN ONE DEMOCRAT QUESTIONED HER QUALIFICATIONS. BECAUSE THE CALDER QUOTED ORTHODOX CATHOLIC. JOE BIDEN IS RUNNING MATE DONALD HARRIS. ACTUALLY ATTACKED ANOTHER ONE OF OUR NOMINEES TO THE FEDERAL COURTS BECAUSE HE WAS A MEMBER OF THE CATHOLIC KNIGHTS OF COLUMBUS. IN THE RANKING DEMOCRAT ON THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE SAID JUDGE BARRETT'S CATHOLIC FAITH WAS OF CONCERN. AND SAID QUOTE. THE DOGMA LIVES LOUDLY WITH ANY. WELL I GOT NEWS FOR THE DEMOCRATS. AND THEIR FRIENDS IN HOLLYWOOD. THAT DOGMA LIVES LOUDLY IN ME. THAT DOG LIVES LOUD A NEW AND THE RIGHT TO LIVE TO WORK DEALERSHIP ACCORDING TO THE DICTATES OF OUR FAITH AND CONSCIENCE LIVES IN THE CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. THESE ATTACKS ON RELIGIOUS FAITH MUST STOP AND THEY MUST STOP NOW. NOW THE SENATE IS A JOB TO DO. AND AFTER THEY DISCHARGE THEIR DUTY TO ADVISE AND CONSENT. I'LL MAKE A PREDICTION. JUDGE AMY CONEY BARRETT WILL BE JUSTICE AMY CONEY BARRETT WE'RE GOING TO FILL THAT SEAT. SPEAKING OF THE SUPREME COURT. THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ALSO DESERVE TO KNOW THE DEMOCRATS ARE ACTUALLY TALKING. ABOUT ADDING SEATS TO THE SUPREME COURT IT'S CALLED PACKING THE COURT. IF THEY WIN THE SALON. IT WOULD BE NOTHING LESS THAN THE BIGGEST POWER GRAB IN AMERICAN HISTORY. THEY WANT TO PACK THE COURT WITH LIBERAL JUDGES THEY WANT TO TEAR DOWN MORE THAN A CENTURY AND A HALF OF JUDICIAL INDEPENDENCE IN THIS COUNTRY. AFTER A HUNDRED AND FIFTY YEARS WITH NINE SEATS ON THE SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES DEMOCRATS IN WASHINGTON ARE TALKING ABOUT PACKING THE COURT. AND JOE BIDEN AND KAMILLA HARRIS WON'T TELL THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. WHAT THEY'RE GONNA DO. JOE BIDEN REFUSED TO ANSWER THE QUESTION DURING THE PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE. YOU MIGHT SAME KAMEL HARRIS REFUSED TO ANSWER THE QUESTION WHEN I POSTED TO HER. DURING THE VICE PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE. AND LAST FRIDAY JOE BIDEN WAS ASKED TO VOTERS DESERVE TO KNOW IF HE PLANS TO PACK THE COURT AND JOE BIDEN SAID QUOTE NO THEY DON'T. WELL JOHN YES THEY DO. THE AMERICAN PEOPLE DESERVE A STRAIGHT ANSWER AND JOE BIDEN COMMA LAYERS NEED TO COME CLEAN WITH THE AMERICAN PEOPLE AND COME CLEAN RIGHT NOW. WHEN YOU'RE RUNNING FOR THE HIGHEST COURT IN THE LAND THE AMERICAN PEOPLE DESERVE TO KNOW. WHETHER YOU'RE GOING TO RESPECT THE HIGHEST COURT IN THE LAND. YOU KNOW THE TRUTH THERE'S ONLY ONE EXPLANATION FIVE THEY WON'T ANSWER THE QUESTION. JOE BIDEN KAMILLA HARRIS WANT TO PACK THE SUPREME COURT. BUT WE'RE NOT GONNA LET IT HAPPEN. WE'RE GONNA RELAX PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP FOR FOUR MORE YEARS IN THE WHITE HOUSE. REMOVING THE PRESERVE IN INDEPENDENT JUDICIARY FOR GENERATIONS TO COME. SO WE STOOD FOR THE RULE OF LAW. AND AN INDEPENDENT JUDICIARY. AND EVERY SINGLE DAY. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP HAS STOOD WITH THE MEN AND WOMEN WHO SERVE ON THE THIN BLUE LINE UP LAW ENFORCEMENT AND WE ALWAYS WILL. LET'S HEAR IT FOR ALL THOSE IN LAW ENFORCEMENT WHO ARE WITH US HERE TODAY. YOU KNOW I LIKE TO SAY ALL MY HEROES WEAR UNIFORMS. WELL THERE'S THOSE OF YOU WHO WORE THE UNIFORM OF THE UNITED STATES FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO. PUT ON THE UNIFORM LAW ENFORCEMENT. AFTER A SINCE I WAS A LITTLE BOY WOULD GO UP TO CHICAGO WE VISIT. MY GRANDPARENTS AND WE WERE THERE WITH MY UNCLE WHO WAS A CHICAGO POLICE OFFICER FOR TWENTY FIVE YEARS WITH. HE COME OUT THE MORNING. DRESSED IN THE UNIFORM. SIDE ARM STRAPPED TO HIS BELT. ME MY THREE BROTHERS AND JUST LOOK AT HIM. IN ALL. I THINK YOU ALL KNOW. THE MEN AND WOMEN WHO SERVE IN LAW ENFORCEMENT IN THIS COUNTRY. ARE THE BEST PEOPLE IN AMERICA AND THEY DESERVE THE RESPECT OF EVERY AMERICAN EVERY DAY. THANK YOU FOR YOUR SERVICE. NOW PRESIDENT TRUMP AND I WILL ALWAYS SUPPORT THE RIGHT OF AMERICANS TO PEACEFUL PROTESTS. BUT WRITING INCLUDING IS NOT PEACEFUL PROTEST. BURNING BUSINESSES IS NOT FREE SPEECH. VIOLENCE AGAINST INNOCENT CIVILIANS THE DESTRUCTION OF PROPERTY OR VIOLENCE AGAINST LAW ENFORCEMENT WILL NOT BE TOLERATED AND THOSE WHO DO THESE THINGS WILL BE PROSECUTED TO THE FULLEST EXTENT OF THE LAW. NOW FOR MONTHS ALL JOE BIDEN TALKED ABOUT WAS PEACEFUL PROTESTERS REMEMBER. ALL SUMMER LONG. AS THE AMERICAN PEOPLE LITERALLY WATCH BUSINESSES IN THEIR COMMUNITIES BURNED TO THE GROUND. I WAS IN MINNEAPOLIS NOT LONG AGO. I TRAVELED WITH THE FLOOR WESTBROOK WONDERFUL AFRICAN AMERICAN BUSINESS ON. HE TOLD ME OF THAT NIGHT. JUST A FEW DAYS AFTER THE KILLING OF GEORGE FLOYD. THAT YOU WATCH VIOLENT PROTESTERS COME CLOSER AND CLOSER AND CLOSER. TO HER BUSINESS. THE BUSINESS'S SHE BUILT A LITTLE SALON. THIRTY FIVE YEARS AGO. THEY PARTNER UP. AND I STOOD ALONGSIDE WHAT REMAINS OF HER BUSINESS. JUST A FEW SHORT WEEKS AGO AND I TOLD FOR. FROM THE HARTFORD THIS PRESIDENT THE HEART OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. WE'RE GONNA REBUILD THAT BUSINESS WE'RE GONNA REBUILD THAT COMMUNITY. BIGGER AND BETTER THAN EVER BEFORE. FLOOR AND ALL THOSE LIKE THAT VICTIMIZED BY THESE VIOLENT PROTESTERS AND RIOTERS DESERVE NOTHING LESS. BUT THE TRUTH IS JOE BIDEN WOULD DOUBLE DOWN ON THE VERY POLICIES THAT ARE LEADING TO VIOLENCE IN OUR CITY. WHEN YOU START TO WITHDRAW SUPPORT. FOR THOSE WHO PROTECT AND SERVE. YOU ONLY EMBOLDEN THOSE WHO WOULD DO HARM. TO OUR COMMUNITIES AND OUR FAMILIES. NOW JOE BIDEN EXPLAINS IT ALL BY SAYING THAT AMERICA IS IN HIS WORDS. SYSTEMICALLY RACIST. AND IT POLICE AS HE SAID AND HIS RUNNING MATE SAID LAST WEEK. THE POLICE HAVE A QUOTE. IMPLICIT BIAS AGAINST MINORITIES WHEN JOE BIDEN WAS ASKED IF IT'S FOR CUTTING FUNDING A LAW ENFORCEMENT HE SAID. YES ABSOLUTELY. LET ME MAKE YOUR PROBLEMS. UNDER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP. WE'RE GONNA BACK TO BLUE WE'RE NOT GONNA D. FUND THE POLICE NOT NOW NOT EVER. UNDER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP WE'RE GONNA HAVE A LAW IN ORDER IN EVERY CITY IN EVERY STATE FOR EVERY AMERICAN OF EVERY RACE AND CREED AND COLOR. SO HELP US GOD. YOU KNOW THE PRESIDENT I KNOW WHAT YOU KNOW WE DON'T HAVE TO CHOOSE BETWEEN SUPPORTING LAW ENFORCEMENT AND SUPPORTING OUR AFRICAN AMERICAN NEIGHBORS AND FAMILY. WE HAVE DONE BOTH FOR THE LAST THREE AND A HALF YEARS AND WE'RE GOING TO KEEP SUPPORTING LAW ENFORCEMENT AND KEEP EXPANDING OPPORTUNITIES IN JOBS AND EDUCATION FOR AFRICAN AMERICANS AND ALL OF OUR MINORITIES FOR FOUR MORE YEARS. SO WE STOOD FOR THE RULE OF LAW FOR LAW AND ORDER. AND ALL THE VALUES THAT HAVE MADE THIS COUNTRY GREAT. AND I CAN'T TO. HOW PROUD I AM. TO BE VICE PRESIDENT TO A PRESIDENT WHO STANDS WITHOUT APOLOGY FOR THE SANCTITY OF HUMAN LIFE. WE'RE JOE BIDEN SUPPORTS TAXPAYER FUNDING OF ABORTION ALL THE WAY UP TO THE MOMENT OF BIRTH PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP IS THE MOST PRO LIFE PRESIDENT IN AMERICAN HISTORY. SO WE REBUILD OUR MILITARY REVIVED OUR ECONOMY STOOD FOR LAW AND ORDER LIBERTIES AND LIFE. IN THREE SHORT YEARS. WE MADE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN. AND NONE OF THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN POSSIBLE. WITHOUT THE STRONG SUPPORT OF OUR ALLIES IN CONGRESS. THAT'S WHY WE NEED TO SEND CONGRESSMAN TROY BALDERSON BACK TO A NEW REPUBLICAN MAJORITY THAT RETIRES NANCY PELOSI ONCE AND FOR ALL. WHAT A GREAT GUY WHAT A GREAT GREAT CHAMPION OF THIS ADMINISTRATION THANK YOU CONGRESS VOTERS. SO WE MADE GREAT PROGRESS IN OUR FIRST THREE YEARS. AND THEN THE CORONAVIRUS STRUCK FROM CHINA. BUT I'M HERE TO TELL YOU. WE NEVER JUST FIVE CASES OF THE CORONAVIRUS IN THE UNITED STATES PRESIDENT TRUMP DID WHAT NO OTHER AMERICAN PRESIDENT HAD EVER DONE HE SUSPENDED ALL TRAVEL FROM CHINA. THE SECOND LARGEST ECONOMY IN THE WORLD. NOW JOE BIDEN SAID THAT WAS QUOTE HYSTERICAL. XENA PHOBIC HE ACTUALLY WROTE IN THE MONTH OF JANUARY THAT BANNING TRAVEL WOULD QUOTE MAKE THINGS WORSE. BUT I CAN TELL YOU. AS THE HEAD OF THE WHITE HOUSE CORONAVIRUS TASK FORCE. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP'S ACTION SUSPENDING TRAVEL FROM CHINA. SAVE UNTOLD AMERICAN LIVES AND IT BOUGHT US TIME TO STAND UP THE GREATEST NATIONAL MOBILIZATION SINCE WORLD WAR TWO. STROKE WE REINVENTED TESTING WE SAW THE MANUFACTURE AND DELIVERY OF HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF MEDICAL SUPPLIES WERE INCREDIBLE DOCTORS AND NURSES WE DEVELOP MEDICINES THAT ARE LITERALLY SAVING LIVES AND WE ARE ON TRACK TO HAVE THE FIRST SAFE AND EFFECTIVE CORONAVIRUS VACCINE BEFORE THE END OF THIS YEAR. AS THE PRESIDENT SAID. ON THE SOUTH LAWN FRIDAY THROUGH THE POWER OF AMERICAN SCIENCE AND MEDICINE. WE WILL REPLICATE THE CHINA VIRUS ONCE AND FOR. YOU KNOW I SPOKE TO THE PRESIDENT THIS MORNING. AND I'M HAPPY TO REPORT TWELVE YEAR THE BUCKEYE STATE. THE PRESIDENT AND THE FIRST LADY. ARE DOING GREAT AND HE IS BACK ON THE ROAD TODAY. LET ME TAKE THIS OPPORTUNITY ON BEHALF OF THE PRESIDENT TO SEE HOW MOVE WE'VE ALL BEEN. BY THE OUTPOURING OF PRAYERS AND CONCERN. FOR THE FIRST FAMILY. I KNOW HOW MUCH IT'S MEANT TO THEM. BUT HE AND I BOTH BELIEVE IT'S REALLY JUST A REFLECTION. BUT THE OUTPOURING OF CONCERN AND PRAYERS AND CARE. THAT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE HAVE SHOWN TO ALL OF OUR NEIGHBORS. THROUGHOUT THIS PANDEMIC. SO CAN WE JUST TAKE A MOMENT. TO SHOW OUR APPRECIATION FOR THE DOCTORS THE NURSES THE FIRST RESPONDERS THOSE IN MINISTRY ALL THOSE THAT HAVE COME ALONGSIDE OUR FAMILIES WHO HAVE SUFFERED LOSS AND STRUGGLE WITH AS PLANNED AND- WE ARE SO GRATEFUL. TO SO EVERY DAY WE'RE ONE DAY CLOSER TO THE DAY WE BUT THE CORONAVIRUS IN THE PAST WITH THE VACCINE MEDICINES. BUT IN THE MEANTIME I PROMISE YOU WILL KEEP PROTECTING THE BALL. KEEP MAKE SURE HEALTH CARE WORKERS OF ALL THE SUPPLIES THEY NEED. WE'LL KEEP SAVING ON. AND WE'RE JOE BIDEN IS TALKING ABOUT SHUTTING DOWN THE ECONOMY. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP. HE'S OPENING UP AMERICA AGAIN. I MEAN AFTER LOSING TWENTY TWO MILLION JOBS AT THE HEIGHT OF THIS PANDEMIC I'M PROUD TO REPORT TO YOU THAT WE'VE ALREADY SEEN ELEVEN AND A HALF MILLION AMERICANS GO BACK TO WORK INCLUDING MORE THAN FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE RIGHT HERE IN THE STATE OF OHIO. WE'RE NOT JUST OPEN UP AMERICA WE'RE OPEN UP AMERICA'S SCHOOLS. WE JUST ANNOUNCED ABOUT TWO WEEKS AGO THAT WE'RE SENDING A HUNDRED MILLION RAPID TESTS FOR THE CORONAVIRUS TO EVERY SCHOOL SYSTEM EVERY SCHOOL NURSE IN AMERICA IT'S OUR KIDS CAN GET BACK IN THE CLASSROOM AND STAY BACK IN THE CLASSROOM SAFE AND SOUND. THE SCHOOLS ARE OPEN AND THANKS TO PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP IN JUST TWO SHORT WEEKS IT'S GOING TO BE ALL THE WAY. BUCKEYE FOOTBALL IS COMING BACK. HOW GOOD IS THAT. IN FACT I JUST HEARD THAT I JUST HEARD THAT THE QUARTERBACK WHO WON THE NATIONAL CHAMPIONSHIP BACK IN TWENTY FOURTEEN IS ACTUALLY WITH US TODAY CARDALE JONES MARIO. LET'S HEAR FOR CARDALE JONES H. OKAY ONE LITTLE TOUGHER THIS HOOSIER TO CHEER FOR OHIO STATE BUT I. I'M NOT SIDE YOU WILL OR WE ARE TO. SO WE'VE GONE THROUGH A TIME OF TESTING. YOU ALL ARE HERE TODAY BECAUSE THREE WEEKS FROM TOMORROW. RECOMENDAR TIME FOR CHOOSING. THE CHOICE IN THIS ELECTION HAS NEVER BEEN CLEARER. STAKES HAVE NEVER BEEN HIGHER. IT'S AMAZING TO THINK IN THE MIDDLE OF A GLOBAL PANDEMIC. JOE BIDEN WANTS TO RAISE TAXES BY FOUR TRILLION DOLLARS. PRESIDENT TRUMP. WE NOT ONLY CUT TAXES A CROSS THE BOARD IN OUR FIRST FOUR YEARS WE'RE GOING TO KEEP CUTTING MIDDLE CLASS TAXES FOR FOUR MORE YEARS. JOE BIDEN WANTS TO BURY OUR ECONOMY UNDER THE AVALANCHE OF REGULATIONS. THEY HAD TO BE REMINDED THAT PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE THAT HE SUPPORTS THE GREAT NEW DEAL. YOU MUST PUT US BACK IN THAT PARIS CLIMATE ACCORD. PRESIDENT TRUMP HE UNLEASHED AMERICAN ENERGY WE STOOD WITH COAL MINERS IN EASTERN OHIO AND NOW AMERICA IS A NET EXPORTER OF ENERGY FOR THE FIRST TIME IN SEVENTY YEARS. JOE BIDEN'S FOR OPEN BORDERS SANCTUARY CITIES FREE LAWYERS AND FREE HEALTHCARE FOR ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS. PRESIDENT TRUMP HE'S MADE RECORD INVESTMENTS IN BORDER SECURITY WE'VE ALREADY BUILT MORE THAN THREE HUNDRED MILES OF THAT BORDER WALL ON THE SOUTHERN BORDER OF THE UNITED STATES AND WITH FOUR MORE YEARS WE'RE GONNA FIX THIS BROKEN IMMIGRATION SYSTEM ONCE AND FOR ALL. WHEN IT COMES TO JOBS IN TRADE. CONTRAST IS CLEARLY SPINNING. YOU KNOW HERE IN THE HEARTLAND I DON'T HAVE TO TELL ANY OF YOU. ABOUT THE IMPACT OF NAFTA OVER THE LAST TWENTY FIVE YEARS. IT OVER THE HOOSIER STATE WE LITERALLY SAW ENTIRE COMMUNITY SHUTTERED. JOBS SHIPPED SOUTH OF THE BORDER. SIXTY THOUSAND FACTORIES CLOSE IN THE TWENTY FIVE YEARS AFTER NAFTA WAS SIGNED INTO LAW. THE JOE BIDEN NEVER LIFTED A FINGER. TO REFORM IT RENEGOTIATE. BUT THANKS TO THE MAN WHO WROTE THE ART OF THE DEAL. OHIO GOT A BETTER DEAL. NAFTA IS GONE AND THE U. S. M. C. A IS HERE TO STAY. IT'S A WIN FOR OHIO AND A WIN FOR AMERICA. IN FOR DECADES FOR DECADES WE SAW AMERICAN. LOSING OUT THE CHINA IN INTERNATIONAL TRADE WHEN WE CAME INTO OFFICE HALF OF OUR INTERNATIONAL TRADE DEFICIT. WAS WITH COMMUNIST CHINA FIVE HUNDRED BILLION DOLLARS A YEAR LOST TO THAT ONE COUNTRY. JOE BIDEN SPENT A CHEERLEADER FOR COMMUNIST CHINA ALL ALONG THE WAY HE ACTUALLY SAID THAT THE RISE OF CHINA WAS A POSITIVE DEVELOPMENT. FOR AMERICAN. IT JOE BIDEN WANTS TO REPEAL ALL THE TERRORISTS THE PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS PUT INTO EFFECT TO HOLD CHINA ACCOUNTABLE AND LEVEL THE PLAYING FIELD FOR AMERICAN WORKERS. PRESIDENT TRUMP. HE PUT CHINA ON NOTICE ON DAY ONE AND THE ERA OF ECONOMIC SURRENDER IS OVER WE'RE GONNA STAND STRONG UNTIL CHINA OPENS THEIR MARKETS TO US GOODS AND RESPECTS THE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS OF AMERICAN BUSINESSES. SO IT'S THE STRONG FOR SECURITY PROSPERITY FREE MARKET PRINCIPLES. PUT AMERICA FIRST. IT IS PRESIDENT TRUMP'S AT MOUNT RUSHMORE. WE'VE ALSO STOOD AGAINST THOSE WHO WOULD IN HIS WORDS WIFE OUT OUR HISTORY DEFAME OUR HEROES. IN A RACE OR VALLEY. THE TRUTH IS JOE BIDEN IN TODAY'S DEMOCRATIC PARTY. HAVE BEEN GIVING IN TO THE MOST RADICAL VOICES IN THIS COUNTRY. VOICES THAT WANT TO CANCEL OUR CULTURE. ERASER HISTORY. ON THIS COLUMBUS DAY. WE SHOULD REMEMBER THAT DAY EARLIER THIS YEAR WHEN RADICALS TOPPLED THE CHRISTOPHER COLUMBUS STATUE IN BALTIMORE'S. INNER HARBOR. BEHEADED THE STATUE OF THE GREAT EXPLORER IN BOSTON. IN HERE IN COLUMBUS OHIO. LAST SUMMER IN THE DEAD OF NIGHT YOU'RE DEMOCRAT MAYOR TOOK DOWN THE STATUE OF CHRISTOPHER COLUMBUS OUTSIDE SITTING. AND HE DID THAT DESPITE THE FACT. THE PROUD ITALIAN AMERICAN FAMILIES LIKE THE SAP CO FAMILY. ACTUALLY PAY TO IMPORT THAT STATURE FROM ITALY SIXTY FIVE YEARS. THE BROOKS IS STILL GOING ON. I DON'T KNOW IF YOU SAW THE NEWS THIS MORNING THE LAST NIGHT. VIOLENT PROTESTERS IN PORTLAND. TORE DOWN STATUES OF ABRAHAM LINCOLN. TEDDY ROOSEVELT. YOU KNOW THE TRUTH IS THE PRESIDENT SAID. TODAY THE RADICAL LEFTIST DETERMINE TO TEAR DOWN EVERY STEP SOME IN MEMORY OF OUR NATIONAL HERITAGE. BUT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE STRONG AND PRO. WE WILL NOT ALLOW OUR COUNTRY AND ALL ITS HISTORY AND CULTURE TO BE TAKEN AWAY FROM US THAT'S ONE MORE REASON WHY WE NEED FOUR MORE YEARS OF PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP'S IN THE WHITE HOUSE. YOU KNOW WHEN YOU LOOK AT THEIR AGENDA. TEARING DOWN OUR ECONOMY TEARING DOWN OUR INSTITUTIONS TURNED ON OUR HISTORY. IT'S CLEAR. JOE BIDEN WOULD BE NOTHING MORE THAN A TROJAN HORSE FOR THE RADICAL LEFT. NOW JOE BIDEN SAID THAT DEMOCRACY IS ON THE BALLOT. WELL I THINK OUR ECONOMIC RECOVERY IS ON ABOUT. LAW AND ORDER ARE ON THE BALLOT. BUT THEY'RE ALSO THINGS FAR MORE FOUNDATIONAL. YOUR COUNTRY THERE ON THE BALLOT IS ONE. IN THIS ELECTION I THINK IT'S NOT GOING TO BE. NOT GONNA BE WHETHER AMERICA WILL END UP MORE CONSERVATIVE OR MORE LIBERAL. MORE READ OR MORE BLUE. MORE REPUBLICAN OR DEMOCRAT. I THINK THE CHOICE IN THIS ELECTION. IS WHETHER AMERICA REMAINS AMERICA. OKAY WE'RE GONNA ALLOW JOE BIDEN AND THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY TO STEER OUR NATION. ON A LEFTWARD PATH FOR MORE GOVERNMENT LESS FREEDOM AND ABANDONMENT OF OUR MOST CHERISHED IDEALS AND HISTORY. WHETHER GOING TO REAFFIRM OUR COMMITMENT EVERYTHING IT'S ALWAYS MADE AMERICA GREAT. SO I WANT TO SAY TO EACH AND EVERYONE OF YOU HERE. THREE WEEKS AND ONE DAY AWAY FROM ELECTION. FOR OUR FREEDOM AND ALL THE IDEALS. THAT HAVE MADE THIS NATION EXCEPTIONAL AND GREAT WE NEED TO DECIDE RIGHT HERE AND RIGHT NOW THE JOE BIDEN WILL NEVER BE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA WE'RE GOING TO RELAX PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP HAS FOUR MORE YEARS. IT'S ON OHIO. IT'S GOING TO TAKE ALL OF US. WELL I ALWAYS LOOMS LARGE IN PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS. ALL THROUGHOUT OUR HISTORY THAT'S JUSTICE TODAY. SO WE NEED YOU TO TELL YOUR NEIGHBORS AND FRIENDS JUST SALES OVER CHAPLAINS ON THE OTHER DAY I RAN INTO MY. PLEASE TELL ME WE NEED FOUR MORE YEARS. AND IF THEY SAID IT WAS SET MAIN CIVIL FOUR MORE YEARS MEANS MORE JOBS. FOUR MORE YEARS MEANS MORE JUDGES. FOUR MORE YEARS MEANS MORE SUPPORT FOR OUR TROOPS AND OUR POLICE. CAN YOU TELL MY SAID IT'S GOING TO TAKE AT LEAST FOUR MORE YEARS TO DRAIN THAT SWAMP. WE'RE DRIN. YOU KNOW FOUR YEARS AGO FOUR YEARS AGO A MOVEMENT WAS BORN. MOVEMENT OF EVERYDAY AMERICANS FROM EVERY WALK OF LIFE. HERE IN OHIO YOU BELIEVE WE COULD BE STRONG AGAIN. WE BELIEVE WE COULD BE PROSPEROUS AGAIN. YOU BELIEVE AMERICA COULD BE PROUD AGAIN STAND TALL IN THE WORLD AGAIN. HE SAID YES THE PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP IN TWENTY SIXTY. AND I KNOW THE BUCKEYES GOING TO SAY YES TO FOUR MORE YEARS OF PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP. YOU KNOW I REALLY ONLY KNOW THIS PRESIDENT FOR ABOUT FOUR YEARS. WE MET EACH OTHER A COUPLE OF TIMES ALONG THE WAY. WHEN I MET HIM BEFORE HE ASKED ME TO JOIN THIS TICKET I. I SENSE WHAT YOU DID FOUR YEARS AGO I SENSED. A VISION. I BELIEVE IN AMERICA BELIEVE IN THE AMERICAN PEOPLE AND THE LEADERSHIP QUALITIES TO MAKE AN. I JOINED A TICKET AND ARE FREE. YOU KNOW SOME PEOPLE THINK WE'RE KIND OF DIFFERENT. I GOTTA TELL YOU WE'VE GOT TO BE VERY CLOSE FRIENDS. IT'S A GREAT HONOR MY LIFE TO BE VICE PRESIDENT TO PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP. THANK YOU FOR THE ON. BUT I WILL TELL YOU SOME OF SENIOR PERCENT. I'VE BEEN AT HIS SIDE EVERY DAY. THE LAST THREE AND A HALF YEARS AND I MAKE A PROMISE EVEN WHEN THE CAMERAS ARE OFF. NOBODY'S AROUND THERE'S NOT A DAY GONE BY. THE PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP HASN'T GOTTEN UP AND FOUGHT TO KEEP THE PROMISES THAT HE MADE TO THE PEOPLE OF OHIO NOW IT'S OUR TURN TO FIGHT FOR HIM. IT'S ON OHIO. WE'RE GONNA BRING IT. YOU'RE GONNA BRING IT. SO KEEP BRINGING ALL THIS ENTHUSIASM KEEP VOICING YOUR SUPPORT. TALK ABOUT ALL THAT WE'VE ACCOMPLISHED ALL ACROSS AMERICA EACH DAY. ALL ACROSS AMERICA.

WHERE YOU TURN ON THE TELEVISION AND SEEMS LIKE. THERE'S MORE THAT DIVIDES US THE NEW NONSENSE IN THIS COUNTRY. I'LL ALWAYS BELIEVE THAT THERE'S. THERE'S A WELLSPRING OF SUPPORT THAT'S.

representatives would the hometown crowd give a round of applause to congressman style for me what a great guy where are you brian thank you brian and while you're at it thank congressman glenn grothman for coming out today he is a tenacious principal conservative but i gotta tell you we're here for one reason and one reason only and that is that wisconsin and america need four more years of president donald trump in the white house [Applause] it's on everybody three weeks from today and the road to victory goes right through wisconsin [Applause] you know uh i was in utah last week we had a little debate with kamala harris i don't know if you had a chance to see it some people think we did all right well let me uh let me be honest with you i i think that wasn't just a debate between two candidates for vice president i think it was a debate between two visions and two futures and joe biden and kamala harris want a future of higher taxes open borders socialize medicine they want to abolish fossil fuels they want to use taxpayer dollars to fund abortion they want to defund the police and pack the supreme court president trump's vision for the future we're going to keep supporting our military we're going to keep cutting taxes rolling back regulation unleashing american energy securing our borders supporting law enforcement life liberty and the constitution of the united states [Applause] when you compare the biden harris agenda with our agenda the choice is clear if you cherish faith and freedom and law and order and life three weeks from today you need to do everything in your power to work to voice to vote to re-elect president donald trump for four more years i mean think about how far we've come four years ago we inherited a military that was hollowed out by devastating budget cuts an economy that was struggling to break out of the slowest recovery since the great depression terrorism was on the rise around the world and worst of all we'd witnessed a steady assault on our most cherished values but in three short years i'm proud to report to you we rebuild our military we restored the arsenal of democracy and i couldn't be more proud to be vice president to a president who cares so deeply about the men and women of our armed forces and their family [Applause] [Music] under president donald trump we're finally giving our soldiers sailors airmen marines and coast guard the resources and the support that they need to defend this nation and you know it's personal to me my son's uh a captain in the united states marine corps and my son-in-law my unworthy son-in-law is an f-18 pilot currently deployed overseas in service in the united states navy [Applause] and on this 245 birthday of the united states navy i'm proud to tell you that we are on track to have a 350 ship navy and 20 of those ships are being built right here at finken terry shipyard in marinette wisconsin [Applause] lot to be proud of so we've stood with those who serve in the uniform of the united states and every single day president donald trump has stood with all the men and women who've worn the uniform of the united states president donald trump is the most pro-veterans president in my lifetime [Applause] in fact since you all are standing if you uh if you served in our military with the men and women who are veterans would you put your hand in the air and let us say thanks one more time for your service to this nation thank you for your service thank you for your service thank you you know when joe biden was vice president america saw years of scandal at the va that shocked the conscience of our nation we literally had veterans who were perishing waiting for services at the va that they earned in the uniform of the united states but under president donald trump those days are over [Applause] in our first year in office president trump signed the most sweeping reforms of the va in 50 years we have fired thousands of va employees that weren't providing the care to our veterans and now veterans choice is available to every veteran in america we didn't just rebuild our military and support our vets in our first three years we revived the american economy created the greatest economy the world has ever known where joe biden wants to raise taxes president trump cut taxes across the board for working families and businesses just like this one we rolled back more federal red tape than any administration in american history we unleashed american energy we fought for free and fair trade and in just three short years businesses large and small created more than 7 million good paying jobs including 61 000 jobs right here in the badger state [Applause] wisconsin achieved a near record low unemployment of 3.1 percent and here in the badger state we also saw average hourly earnings grew nearly as much in our first three years as they did during all eight years when joe biden was vice president it may be most meaningful all to me and the president during those first three years wages rose across the board the fastest pace in 10 years but they rose most rapidly for hard-working blue-collar americans the forgotten men and women of america were forgotten no more and can i just say none of that would have been possible without the strong and principled leadership and partnership the president and i enjoyed with former governor scott walker [Applause] president trump and i know scott walker's leadership past present and future will make a great difference for wisconsin and america and then standing here at weldol a great manufacturing company i i'm just remembering back when joe biden was vice president america lost 200 000 manufacturing jobs you know i like to say being from the heartland as well out in this part of the country we do two things well we make things and we grow things right manufacturing and agriculture is the heart of the heartland but remember when joe biden was vice president four years ago his president said that those manufacturing jobs they lost were never coming back you remember he said uh what magic wand do you have well we didn't need a magic wand we just needed president donald trump in the white house 500 000 manufacturing jobs in just three years including 16 000 right here in wisconsin [Applause] and all along the way president donald trump has stood for the rule of law we stand here today i'm proud to report to you that we've seen confirmed more than 230 conservative judges to our federal courts at every level and they're all men and women who will uphold the god-given liberties in our constitution like the freedom of religion the freedom of speech and the second amendment right to keep and bear arms [Applause] now last month we paused as a nation to honor the life and service of the late justice ruth bader ginsburg but when the memorials were over president donald trump fulfilled his constitutional duty and he nominated a principled extraordinary conservative woman to the supreme court of the united states judge amy coney barrett and she's from the hoosier stage [Applause] just saying you know the confirmation hearings have started i was watching a little bit on air force two on the way here america is seeing the character the quality and the intellect that judge amy coney barrett shine forth president and i said early on though democrat on the judiciary committee actually said that judge barrett's catholic faith was of concern [Music] senator feinstein said because quote the dogma lives loudly within you and hollywood elites have already begun to criticize judge barrett for her family and her faith well i got news for the democrats and their friends in hollywood that dogma lives loudly in me [Music] that dogma lives loudly in you and the right to live and work and worship according to the dictates of our faith lives loudly in the constitution of the united states of america [Applause] [Music] [Applause] these attacks on religious faith must stop and they must stop now now the senate has a job to do and they're going about the business of advising and consenting right now but i'll make your prediction judge amy coney barrett will soon be justice amy coney barrett we're gonna fill that seat but you know talking about the supreme court people of wisconsin deserve to know that after 150 years with nine seats on the supreme court of the united states democrats in washington are actually talking about packing the court and joe biden is refusing to answer the question he refused to answer the question in the presidential debate his running mate kamala harris refused to answer the question when i posed it to him and last friday joe biden was asked if voters deserved to know if he was going to pack the court and he said and i quote no they don't [Music] well joe yes we do when you're running for the highest office in the land the american people deserve to know if you're going to respect the highest court in the land [Applause] i mean you all get it out here in the heartland you know we might have been born in the morning but we weren't born yesterday morning i mean the only explanation about why they aren't answering the question is because joe biden and kamala harris are planning to pack the court with liberal judges if they win this election but we're not going to let it happen we're going to re-elect president donald trump for four more years and protect an independent judiciary for generations to come so we've stood for the rule of law and an independent judiciary conservatives on our courts and as congressman style just said every single day president donald trump has stood with the men and women who serve on the thin blue line of law enforcement and we always will you know i like to say all my heroes wear uniforms it's true when i was growing up my mom and dad used to take us back home where they grew up chicago and go to my grandparents house and there i'd see my uncle he's a young man then he'd come walking out in that police uniform side arm strapped to his side me and my three brothers just look up in awe president trump and i know what you all know the men and women who serve in law enforcement are some of the best people in this country and they deserve the respect of every american every single day now the president and i will always support the right of americans to peaceful protest enshrined in the constitution but rioting and looting is not peaceful protest burning businesses is not free speech violence against innocent civilians the destruction of property or violence against law enforcement will not be tolerated and those who do these things will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law [Applause] now for months all joe biden talked about was peaceful protesters remember all summer long as the american people watch businesses and communities literally burn we saw cities in wisconsin like kenosha and milwaukee beset by violence and destruction the truth of the matter is though joe biden would double down on the policies that have led to violence in america cities i mean when you withdraw support for those who protect and serve you only embolden those who would do harm to our families and our communities i mean it's no surprise milwaukee has literally seen 110 percent increase in homicides this year all while milwaukee's democrat mayor has called for cutting 120 police officers from his 2021 now joe biden justifies it all by saying that america in his words is systemically racist and he says that police have a quote implicit bias against minority when joe biden was asked if he'd support cutting funding to law enforcement he replied yes absolutely and let me make your promise under president donald trump we're not going to defund the police not now not ever we're going to back the blue every day for four more years [Applause] under president donald trump we're going to have law and order in every city in every state for every american of every race and creed and color so help us god you know the president and i know what you know we don't have to choose between supporting law enforcement and supporting our families in the african-american community or in other minority communities i mean the truth of the matter is we have done both for the last three and a half years we've supported law enforcement four thousand police officers funded through the cops program operation legend surged into cities around the country and under this president i'm proud to say in our first three years we had the lowest unemployment rate ever recorded for african americans we made funding to historically black colleges and universities permanent with record funding we've passed criminal justice reform and president trump fought for school choice for every family and every community in this country so we're going to keep doing both we're going to keep supporting law enforcement and keep supporting our african-american neighbors so we stood for the rule of law we've stood for law and order for every america of every race and creed and color and from day one this president has also stood for the right of every american to live to work and to worship according to the dictates of our conscience people of faith had no greater champion than president donald trump true under this president's leadership we restored the conscience rights of doctors and nurses teachers and religious charities and president donald trump ended the last administration's assault on the little sisters of the poor and the supreme court voted by seven to two to make it permanent [Applause] i mean it's amazing to think about it you know i'm a product of eight years of catholic education you with me [Applause] i mean i had some wonderful nuns that poured that foundation in my life and i was afraid of almost every single one are you with me unbelievable women but think about the little sisters of the poor women have taken a vow of poverty to do nothing more than to help the underserved community and when joe biden was vice president they hauled the little sisters in the federal court to force them to compromise their faith to live under the mandates of obamacare but you all deserve to know that after the supreme court ruled in our favor and in favor of the little sisters of the poor joe biden said if he's elected he's going to work to reimpose the obamacare mandates on the little sisters of the poor and other religious institutions in fact if you doubt it even his running mate attacked one of our judicial nominees that we were appointing from nebraska because he was a member of the catholic knights of columbus well let me tell you men and women with four more years of president donald trump in the white house we're going to respect the religious freedom of every american of every faith so help us god and when you talk about values beyond all that i couldn't be more proud to be vice president to a president who stands without apology for the sanctity of human life [Applause] where joe biden and kamala harris support taxpayer funding of abortion all the way up to the moment of birth president donald trump is the most pro-life president in american history so we've rebuilt our military revived our economy we've stood for law and order liberties and life and let me say none of that would have been possible without the strong and consistent support of you conservative leaders from here in wisconsin would you join me in thanking senator ron johnson for his firm principled leadership in the united states senate we need a renewed republican majority in the senate and we need congressman brian style and congressman glenn grothman back in a new republican majority that will retire nancy pelosi once and for all [Applause] i mean it's amazing to think about what we accomplished in our first three years with a republican house and a republican senate we laid a foundation of security and prosperity that i think is only one way to describe it in three short years we made america great again [Music] am i right and then the coronavirus struck from china but i'm here to tell you before the first documented case of community transmission within the united states president trump did what no american president had ever done in our history he suspended all travel from china the second largest economy in the world now joe biden said that was quote hysterical and xenophobic he actually wrote an editorial in january where he said it was fear-mongering that suspending travel would actually make things worse but i can tell you firsthand as head of the white house coronavirus task force president trump's action suspending all travel from china bought us invaluable time to stand up the largest national mobilization since world war ii and it saved countless american lives in the time that we gained we reinvented testing we've done more than 120 million tests so far we sort of the manufacture and delivery of hundreds of billions of supplies of medical supplies we're developing medicines that are literally saving lives and i'm proud to report we are on track to have the first safe and effective coronavirus vaccine before the end of this year as president trump said on the south lawn a few days ago through the power of american science and medicine we will eradicate the china virus [Applause] you know i i spoke to the president this morning before i got on the plane and i'm happy to report president and first lady melania are doing just great and he is back on the road today but let me say on the president's behalf how moved we've all been by the outpouring of concern and especially prayers for our first family it's meant so much but the president and i know the outpouring of love and care and concern for them is just emblematic of the same care and concern and prayers that the american people have ushered for family and neighbors and friends and even strangers that have dealt with this coronavirus pandemic and so can we just take a moment we give a round of applause to the doctors the nurses the first responders all those in ministry who've come alongside families struggling with loss in the midst of this pandemic you are heroes all and i promise all of you we're we're going to keep making sure our doctors and nurses have all the resources they need we're going to keep protecting the vulnerable and saving lives and while joe biden is talking about shutting down our economy under president donald trump we're opening up america again i mean it's just the last five months after losing 22 million jobs at the height of this pandemic we've already seen 11 and a half million americans go back to work including 237 000 people right here in wisconsin it's amazing we're opening up america and we are opening up america's schools we announced a week ago that we're distributing a hundred million rapid point-of-care tests to school nurses and school administrators all across america just to make sure we can get our kids back in the classroom and keep them safely back in the classroom where they belong in fact you talk about you know i've been married to a school teacher for 35 years and karen is already back in the classroom at that little christian school she teaches can we just hear it for all the teachers who did all the remote teaching and all the what an incredible job [Applause] we love all of you great job so men and women of wisconsin we've gone through a time of testing but in three weeks from today we're coming to a time for choosing the choice in this election has never been clear the stakes have never been higher it's amazing to think in the middle of a global pandemic joe biden wants to raise taxes by 4 trillion dollars president trump we not only cut taxes in our first three years but we're going to keep cutting taxes for middle class americans for four more years joe biden wants to bury our economy under an avalanche of red tape the president had to remind him the other day that he actually supports the green new deal he wants to put us back in that paris climate accord president trump he's cut red tape at record levels our air and land and water are the cleanest in any time in history and america is a net exporter of energy for the first time in 70 years and when it comes to trade so important here in the heartland international trade what we make what we grow the contrast couldn't be more clear when we came into office half of our international trade deficit was with communist china it's true we were losing 500 billion dollars a year to china in our trading relationship joe biden's been a cheerleader for communist china all along the way in fact he said that the rise of china was a positive development maybe for china president trump he put china on notice that the era of economic surrender is over we impose tariffs on china to demand that they open their markets to what we make and what we grow and we're going to stand firm until china opens the door to american manufacturing and agriculture [Applause] and closer to home i don't have to tell all of you what nafta meant across the heartland it's just amazing back in indiana we literally saw entire communities shuttered in the 25 years since nafta was signed into law jobs moved south to mexico i mean literally on election day four years ago we heard of a company in indiana that was announcing they were still moving shops to mexico and joe biden never lifted a finger for 25 years to improve nafta but thanks to the man who wrote the art of the deal [Music] wisconsin in america got a real deal the usmca is here today and nafta is yesterday [Music] let me tell you usmca was a huge victory for wisconsin workers and wisconsin dairy i mean before the usmca canada was actually imposing quotas on our great dairy industry they had tariffs running as high as 300 percent on dairy products like what's called specialty milk but i was there many times when the president was on the phone with his counterpart in canada i'm telling you what he drove a hard bargain for derry president donald trump fought for wisconsin dairy and under the usmca we're going to export 300 million dollars more in derry every single year and i'm telling you the people of this state also deserve to know that joe biden's running mate kamala harris was one of only 10 senators to vote against the usmca i brought it up last week in utah and she said the usmca didn't go far enough on climate change i mean kamala harris put her radical environmental agenda ahead of wisconsin dairy and wisconsin workers and it's one more reason why wisconsin needs to say no to joe biden and kamala harris and yes to four more years of president donald trump in the white house [Applause] and even closer to home here in the state where school choice began people of wisconsin deserve to know that joe biden and kamala harris they want to end school choice they want to shut down charter schools president trump and i we've been fighting to give every parent the right to choose where their children go to school regardless of their income and area code and we're going to fight for parental choice in education for four more years finally where president trump and i have been working every day to give the american people better health care that protects pre-existing conditions and lowers the cost of health insurance without growing the size of government joe biden and kamala harris are planning a government takeover of health care and kamala harris was the original co-sponsor of bernie sanders socialist medicare for all bill and joe biden's embrace of a public option in obamacare would put us on an inevitable path to socialized medicine and let me make your promise with four more years of president donald trump in the white house we're going to give the american people the world class health care that you deserve we're going to protect pre-existing conditions we're going to lower the cost of health insurance we're going to harness the power of the free market and america will never be a socialist country [Applause] you know when you look at their agenda it's clear i mean joe biden would be nothing more than a trojan horse for the radical left now joe biden says that democracy is on the ballot well i think our economic recovery is on the ballot i think law and order are on the ballot but i also believe that things much more foundational to who we are are on the ballot you know i think three weeks from today when all the dust settles in this election it's not it's not going to be whether america is more republican or more democrat more conservative or more liberal more red or more blue i think the choice in this election is whether america remains american [Applause] whether we're going to chart a course for our children and our grandchildren it's grounded in our highest ideals of freedom individual responsibility and all the values enshrined in our constitution or whether we're going to let joe biden and kamala harris and their party take us down a path towards socialism and decline so let me say from my heart for our freedom and all the ideals that have always made america great we need to decide right here and right now that joe biden will never be president of the united states we're going to re-elect president donald trump for four more years so i'm grateful you came out today i want to give give wild all manufacturing another round of applause would you thank you for dave thanks for having me out thank you to you and your family and your great team it is great to be back it truly is but i'm uh i hope you'll uh i hope you'll carry what i've said here today every day for the next three weeks i mean say you know i was over at weldol the other day i ran into mike out in the parking lot and he was telling me what four more years are going to mean for this country you tell him i said four more years means more jobs [Applause] four more years means more judges four more years means more support for our troops and our police and you tell them i said it's going to take at least four more years to drain that swamp you know four years ago a movement was born you were all a part of it so was i the movement of everyday americans from every walk of life here in wisconsin you believed we could be strong again you believe we could be prosperous again wisconsin said yes to president donald trump in 2016. and i know wisconsin's going to say yes to four more years of president donald trump in 2020 but it's going to take all of us to do it [Applause] i mean it's on it's on everybody three weeks to go and i'm telling you what in all the efforts that you put forward in everything that remains between now and the close of the polls i want to assure you i've been with this with this president every day for the last four years i've seen him when the cameras are off but nobody's looking and i can tell you firsthand my friend our president has never stopped fighting to keep the promises that he made to the people of wisconsin now it's our turn to fight for him so i got a couple things to ask of you number one keep bringing all this enthusiasm i got to tell you what you people what a great group man first and foremost you need to vote wisconsin vote for four more years of president donald trump in the white house i'm told early voting starts in just a few days and remember friends don't let friends vote along bring a family member bring a neighbor bring a co-worker and after you vote i want you to tell somebody you know i'll always believe that the most powerful media in america is not your big newspapers or your big tv networks it's not all your cable news it's not even social media what you all approved in 2016 it's the most powerful media in america is with someone who knows you and respects you hears from you about an issue a candidate a cause that you think is important to them and their family and the state and the nation so right after you vote i want you to spend every day between now and election day talking about all that we've done for this country talking about the choice in this election because i really believe it made the difference in 2016. the american people were talking to one another we were turning down the sound of all the tv pundits and the prognosticators and we were listening to each other and listening to the heart of this nation and finally i would ask you if you're uh if you're inclined to do one more thing that you consider doing that over the next three weeks you know all my travels around this country over the last four years i'm convinced of two things that america is a freedom-loving nation and america is a nation of faith [Music] i mean the sweetest words the president and i ever hear are when people will reach out across a rope line stop you on a street corner or in all the letters that i receive almost every single ones people tell you i'm praying for you and so i just want to say to each one of you if you're inclined to bow the head and bend the knee be a good time to do it over the next three weeks and when you pray i want to encourage you to pray with confidence that in those ancient words that americans have clung to in much more challenging times than we could possibly imagine that if his people who are called by his name will humble themselves and pray and turn that he'll do like he's always done through the long and storied history of this nation he'll hear from heaven and he'll heal this land this one nation under god indivisible with liberty and justice for all so pray for america pray for all the american people it'll make a difference [Applause] and i'm going to have to blow out of here what a what a great wisconsin win fantastic but i want to i want to thank you all for coming out today and i just leave here today more confident than ever that if all of us do all that we need to do in every day between now november 3rd and we're going to

132,mDkTrpxXAio,pence,2020-10-14T18:39:00Z,Full Speech: Mike Pence Rallies Supporters in Grand Rapids,speech,michigan peter meyer the state republican chair laura cox [Music] national committee woman kathy burton all the great men and women of black's enterprises it is great to be back in the wolverine state i appreciate you all coming out feels and looks like fall in the heartland doesn't it i just love it but i got to be honest with you i'm here for one reason and one reason all and that is in michigan and america need four more years of president donald trump it's on and the road to victory runs right through michigan and while you're at it president trump and i need michigan to send john james to the united states grand rapids needs to send that west point grad army veteran a man who's led humanitarian efforts at home and around the world to capitol hill we need peter meyer you know four years a ago of everyday americans from every walk of life here in michigan you knew we could be strong again you knew we could be prosperous again you said yes to president donald trump in 2016 and i know michigan is going to say yes to four more years of president and we're out there telling the story about a week ago i was in salt lake city utah we had a little debate out there between me some people think we did okay let me be clear with all it's a privilege for me to be on that stage representing our group that debate was not so much a debate between two candidates as it was between two visions the joe biden and kamala harris want higher taxes open borders socialize medicine they want to abolish fossil fuels they want taxpayer funding of abortion they want to defund [Music] president trump's vision we rebuild our military we cut taxes we roll back regulations we unleashed american energy secured our border supported law enforcement and we have stood for liberty for life in the constitution of the united states you know when you compare the bible harris agenda with origin the choice is clear if you cherish faith and freedom and love and order and life in a little less than three weeks we need to re-elect president donald trump you know four years ago we inherited a military that had been hollowed out by devastating veterans an economy that was struggling to break out of the slowest recovery since the great depression terrorism was on the rise around the world and we witnessed the steady and solid or most cherished value but in three short years all of that's changed [Music] most importantly we rebuilt our military we restored the arsenal of democracy and we are once again giving our soldiers sailors airmen marines and coast guard the resources and the support that they need you know as the proud father of the united states marine [Music] and the father-in-law the united states navy pilot who's currently deployed i have to say i couldn't be more proud to serve alongside a president who cares so deeply about the men and women of our armed forces and their families and we have just stood for those who wear the uniform president donald trump has stood with all the men and women who have served in the uniform of the united states donald trump is the most pro-veteran president in my life you know when joe biden was vice president you all remember it here in michigan joe biden was vice president he saw years of scandal at the va that literally shocked the conscience of the nation but under president trump's leadership we signed the most sweeping reforms of the va in 50 years we fired thousands of va employees they weren't giving our veterans the care they deserve and veterans choice is now available for every veteran in america [Applause] you know i gotta believe among us there are lots of men and women who've worn the uniform of the united states just like your future congressman peter meyer so if you're able to stand or raise your hand if you served in the armed forces of the united states would you mind just standing up or a race we didn't just rebuild our military and stand with our veterans but after the slowest i want to say that again it was the slowest economic recovery since the great depression president donald trump lit the fires of the american economy and we created the greatest economy the world has ever known where joe white wants to raise taxes in our first three years we cut taxes across the board for working families businesses large and small this president signed more bills cutting federal red tape than any president in american history we unleashed american energy fought for free and fair trade and in just three years businesses large and small created seven million good paying jobs including 125 000 jobs right here in the wolverine [Applause] those first three years michigan achieved its lowest unemployment rate in 20 years right in this state the average hourly earnings grew nearly as much in our first three years as they did in all eight years that joe biden was vice president and maybe what's most important to the president after wages had been stagnant for many years all across the heartland wages were rising at their fastest base in more than 10 years and they were rising most rapidly for hard-working blue-collar americans you know i'm from just down south to hoosier state i always like to stay out in this part of the country we do two things particularly well we make things and grow things right and this president from early on said that we were going to bring american jobs back we were going to bring the heart land back we're going to bring back those four beautiful words made in the usa and that's just what we've got [Applause] under president trump's leadership those less taxes less regulations fight for free and fair trade i'm proud to report here the great state of michigan that the automotive industry is roaring back in america last year gm announced around 400 jobs in this state and fiat chrysler already is building a 1.6 billion dollar new assembly plant here in michigan that's going to create 6 400 good paying jobs now that's quite a contrast joe biden was vice president and you all remember i actually lost 200 000 manufacturing jobs and the last president four years ago said they were never coming back remember all that he said what magic wand do you have well we didn't need a magic wand we just needed president donald trump created in just three years here in the world marine state [Applause] [Music] leadership i promise your president donald trump and i will always go to michigan jobs so it's been about security and about prosperity president donald trump every day of this administration has also stood strong we've appointed more than 200 conservatives to our federal courts and i can tell you firsthand they are all men and women who will hold all the god-given liberties in our constitution like the freedom of religion freedom of speech and the second [Applause] you know last month we rightly paused as a nation to honor the life and service of the late justice ruth bader kids when the memorials were over president donald trump fulfilled his duty under the constitution when he nominated a brilliant principal conservative woman to the supreme court of the united states they're in day three of those hearings in the united states senate president i have continued to call on senators to provide judge merritt with a respectful hearing and respect that nomination every day but you know we have reason to be concerned you all remember a couple years ago when judge barrett was nominated in the court of appeals out this way the ranking democrat on the judiciary committee criticized her catholic faith saying and i quote the dogma lives loudly within you and hollywood liberals already started attacking her for faith the day the president nominated her to the supreme court well i got a message for the democrats and their hollywood friends that dogma lives loudly [Applause] [Music] the senate has a job to do they're going about their constitutional role to advise consent but after they finish their work i'll make your prediction judge amy coney barrett is going to be justice on the supreme court of the united states now while we're talking about the supreme court people of michigan deserve to know that after 150 years with nine members of the supreme court of the united states leading democrats in washington are actually talking about packing the court you also joe biden refused to answer the question during the presidential debate his running mate kamala harris during the primaries actually said that she was quote absolutely open to pacquiao and when i tried to get her to answer the question during our debate last friday joe biden was asking voters didn't deserve to know if he plans to pack the court he said quote no they don't yesterday he dodged the question again refused to rule it out you know when you're running for the highest office in the land you owe it to the american people to say whether or not you're going to respect the highest one court why they won't answer the question you know out here in the heartland we like to say you know i was born in the morning but not yesterday morning okay come on they're ducking the question because joe biden and kamala harris are going to back the supreme court with liberal judges if they win this election they're going to add seats to the supreme court of the united states and fill them with activist judges in what would be the biggest power grab in american history but we're not gonna let it happen we're gonna re-elect president donald trump for four more years a republican majority in the united states senate with john james in that chamber okay we're going to stand on the constitution and we're going to preserve an independent judiciary speaking of the rule of law i couldn't be more proud to serve alongside a president who has stood every day with the men and women who serve in law enforcement at every level president donald trump and i know that is the men and women who put on the uniform of law enforcement every day are the best people in this world [Music] they deserve the respect of every american every day you know when i was growing up down in a small town in southern indiana we used to drive up to chicago this is my grandparents i see my uncle getting dressed put on that police officer all my heroes are we still with law enforcement but i want to be clear president trump and i will always support the right of americans and peaceful protests rioting and looting is not peaceful burning businesses is not free violence against innocent civilians the destruction of property or violence against law enforcement will not be tolerated and those who do these things will be prosecuted to the fullest joe biden extent his running mate talked about were peaceful protesters remember all summer long well the american people literally watched the businesses of their communities that debate last week i traveled there fighting for westbrook detroit i met for in minneapolis just a couple weeks earlier wonderful african-american business owner he opened us a lot 35 years she told me in the days following the killing of jewish voice she watched as the violent group looters and protesters came closer and closer to the business more deserve better all of our families deserve better and we're going to rebuild florence business rebuild that community for all of our families in all of our cities you know the truth is i think you all know joe biden would double down on the policies that have literally led to violence in our city when you start to withdraw support for those who protect and serve you only emboldened those who would do harm to our families now joe biden justifies it all by saying that he thinks america is quote systemically racist and that police have in his words an implicit bias against menorah when joe biden was asked if he'd support cutting funding to law enforcement he said yes absolutely let me make your promise under president donald trump we're going to back the blue we're going to have long enforcement in every city in every state in this nation for every american of every race and creed and color so help us god [Applause] you know you all in michigan no or we know down in the hoosier state we're going to choose between supporting law enforcement and supporting our african americans families and neighbors and other minorities that live in our city this president has done both for three and a half years in our first three and a half years we we funded four thousand new law enforcement officers for the cops program with the violence engulfed many of our cities we launched operational legend named after a four-year-old boy was literally killed in his home while they slept in a pillow fort he and his dad now we've arrested more than 2 500 violent offenders in cities across the world and she supported law enforcement i have to tell you how proud i am in our first three years because of the economic policies we advanced we had the lowest unemployment ever recorded for african americans with the highest funding ever for historically black colleges and universities we passed criminal justice record and we have fought to give every parent in every community the right to choose where their children go to school so we've supported law enforcement and we've supported our minorities and we'll keep going and every single day as we've supported the rule of law this president is stood strong for the right of every american to live the word to worship lord that dictates their conscience people of faith have no greater champion than president donald trump in this administration we restored the conscience rights of doctors nurses teachers and religious charities and president donald trump ended the assault on the little sisters of the poor and the supreme court voted seven to two to make it permanent think about that i'm the product of eight years of catholic education i have nothing but love and a deep respect for nuns can i get an amen on that anybody else thank you very much i think about that little sisters is poor these are incredible women answering all the faith of all of certain took a vow of poverty to do nothing other than help the underprivileged humans joe black was vice president they hauled them into federal court to force them to compromise their faith and live under the mandates of obamacare and believe it or not after the supreme court ruled joe biden announced that he was going to reimpose the obamacare mandates on the little sisters of the poor and religious institutions around the country in fact the religious intolerance spans their whole ticket his running name kamal harris actually attacked one of our nominees to the federal war because he was a member of the catholic knights of columbus let me make you a promise with four more years of president donald trump in the white house we're going to respect the religious freedom of every american of every faith so help us [Applause] god to serve alongside a president who stands without apology for the sanctity of your life where joe biden and donald harris support taxpayer funding of abortion all the way up to the moment of birth president donald trump has stood strong for the unborn and president trump is the most pro-life president in american history [Applause] so we've rebuilt our military revived our economy stood for law and order liberties and life let me say none of that would have been possible without the strong and consistent support of michigan's republican delegation on capitol hill that's why right after you send john james to the united states senate we need you to send bill paisinga fred upton john pollinar jack bourbon tim wahlberg and peter meyer to a new republican majority in the house and retire nancy pelosi you know when you look at what we all were able to accomplish with republican majorities in the house our first two years we made america great again and then the coronavirus struck from china but i can tell you when there were only five documented cases of coronavirus in the united states all of which had come back from china president trump did what no american president had ever done he suspended all travel from china the second largest he said it was xenophobic in fact he wrote in the week before i always keep an eye on the flag [Applause] the week before the president made that decision you all deserve to know joe biden said to make things worse it's close off travel for sure in fact back when they were dealing with the h1n1 in 2009 when joe biden was vice president they uh they refused to close the board of the mexico but i want to tell you firsthand is the head of the white house corrupt virus president trump's action suspending all travel from china saved untold american lives and brought us in valuable time to stand up the greatest national mobilization we saw to the manufacturer the delivery of billions of supplies of ppe and medical equipment to our incredible doctors and nurses we've been developing medicines and therapeutics at a record pace and we're on track to have the first safe and effective vaccine before the end of this year with tens of millions of doses available as president trump said saturday on the south law with the power of american science and medicine we will eradicate the china by responsible you know i spoke to the president this morning told him i was headed to michigan and i'm happy to report to each and every one of you he's back on the plane today president the first lady are doing great and he is out on the campaign not just for the first family but forever those of you that are here and looking on the lost loved ones are struggling with this virus the outpouring of concern across the country the president the first lady is really just emblematic of what the american people have done in fact could we just take a minute we just say uh show how grateful we are to the doctors the nurses the first responders thank you i promise all of you we're going to keep making sure that our doctors and nurses have all the resources they need to provide the level of health care to anyone in this country that we want a family member of ours in but we're going to keep protecting the baltimore and keep saving lives while joe biden is talking about shutting down the economy under president donald trump we're opening up america again you know in just the last five months after losing 22 million jobs at the height of this pandemic because of the foundation that we pour because of the extraordinary recovery and relief that the president secured from the congress for families and businesses we've already seen 11 and a half million americans go back to work including nearly 600 000 people right here in michigan so we're opening up america and we are opening up america's schools last week we started distributing 100 million rapid point of care tests to school nurses and administrators all across america so we can get our kids back in the classroom and keep them back in school where they belong and thanks to president trump's leadership a week from this saturday big ten football is back michigan state will be back with the gridiron and spartan stadium in the wolverines will be back in the big house we're coming back we're coming back we've got a great american comeback the truth is we've gone through a time of testing in this last year but in less than three weeks we're going to come with time for choosing that's the reason why we're all here today and i want to tell you from my heart i think the choice in this election has never been clear the stakes have never been higher it's amazing to think in the middle of a global pandemic joe biden wants to raise taxes by four trillion dollars president trump we not only cut taxes across the board our first four years we're going to keep cutting taxes for middle-class americans from florida joe biden wants to bury our economy under an avalanche of red tape the president had to remind him the other night that he actually supports the green new deals he wants to put us back in the paris climate accord president trump we've been cutting red tape at a record pace that we still have the cleanest air and land and water in history and america is a net exporter of energy for the first time in 70 years when it comes to trade and jobs truth is when we took office america was losing 500 billion a year in our trade imbalance to china where joe biden's been a cheerleader for communist china all along the way he said that the rise of china was a positive development president trump put china on notice on day one he said the era of economic surrender is over on china to level the playing field we're going to stand strong until they respect american workers and respect american property and here in the heartland i don't have to tell any of you about the impact of that it's amazing to think the days since nafta was signed into law we literally saw 60 thousand american factories close many of those jobs go south out of the hoosier state i saw one community almost entirely shuttered as thousands of jobs disappeared overnight and left our shores the truth of the matter is all along the way joe biden never lifted a finger to reform to renegotiate in a way that put american jobs automotive jobs here in the heart thanks to the man who wrote the art of the deal america's got a way better deal nafta is gone and the united states mexico canada agreement is here i may not know usmca is a huge win for america but it's a big win for michigan and michigan auburn under the usmca 75 of all auto parts have to be made in north america and 40 of them have to be made by workers making the average hourly wage equal to the average hourly wage in the united states of america we are protecting american workers protecting american jobs with the usfca now the people of michigan deserve to know not only did joe biden not lift a finger to reform it for all those years but joe biden's running mate kamala harris was one of only 10 senators to vote against the uss she said the usmca didn't go far enough on the planet ship the truth is kamala harris put her radical environmental agenda ahead of michigan auto workers and michigan auto jobs that's one more reason why michigan needs to say no to joe biden and kamala harris and yes it's not just about jobs you know joe biden and kamala harris are planning a government takeover kabla harris was the original ghost monster of bernie sanders and joe biden added what's called a public option to obamacare that would send america on an inevitable path towards socialized medicine president trump and i we've been working to give the american people better health care we've lowered the cost of prescription drugs across the country we have expanded right to try for families to have access to life-saving medicine and we are going to have health care that protects pre-existing conditions and lowers the cost of health insurance without growing the science of our health government system in a way that respects the doctor-patient relationship is built on the power of the free market and makes sure that america will never be a socialist country truth is when you unhealthy at their agenda it's clear joe biden would be nothing more than a trojan horse for the radical now joe biden says that democracy is on the ballot president and i believe that our economic recovery is on law and order are all about but i think there's also things far more foundational to our nation that are on the ballot as well you know in this election i think it's not so much whether we're going to be more conservative whether we'll be more republican or more democrat more red i think the choice in this election is whether america remains america it's whether we're going to chart a course based on our highest ideals of freedom free enterprise personal responsibility traditional values or whether we're going to let joe by the democratic party and the radical left take us on a leftward path towards socialism so let me say all of you gathered here on this blustery day for our freedom and all the ideals that have always made america great we need to decide right here and right now that joe biden will never be president of the united states so i need you to be out there folks i need you to tell your neighbors and friends what four more years means telling you rovered lacks enterprises you ran into michaels standing in front of this view four more years means more judges four more years means more support for our troops and our beliefs you tell them i said it's going to take at least four more years to drain that swamp you know folks i've served alongside this president the last three and a half years i've only known him we've been a few times some people think we're kind of different but actually we've become very close and i serve alongside every day and i can tell you that when the cameras are off the bright lights are off there's not a day off that president donald trump hasn't gotten up and fought to keep the promises that he made to the people of michigan now it's our turn to fight for him first and foremost the next 20 days or on election day i need you to vote michigan vote for four more years president donald trump in the white house called early voting started on september 24th here in michigan you don't have plans tomorrow you can actually head down cascade township clerk's office they're open 9-1 28-65 lower hills southeast right here in grand rapids and remember friends don't let friends vote alone bring a family member bring a neighbor bring a co-worker and vote for four more years of president donald like you're doing trump i need you to go out and tell the story i need you to bring the enthusiasm talk to your neighbors and friends and worship and work say you know what i ran into mike the other day at lax enterprises that guys stood out there talked for like an hour just like summarizing everything that we got done how this president has led us it was tell them about the challenging you know honestly uh keep thinking about this time of the election four years and all the polls back then kind of like now it looks so good i mean literally we had a whole range of different polling one where we were losing by a lot others were losing by law right but i knew something else was going on as i was traveling around the country i was seeing good people like you i saw the tens of thousands of people coming out for our candidate i'm seeing the hundreds of people that were coming out when i saw the determination on people's faces we knew that in some real senses the american people were turning down the sound on all the experts pundits and police [Music] you know it's great to be back in grand rapids because uh the president of the campaign actually ended early in the morning just right past midnight i looked up this little timex watch and i remember i leaned in and i said welcome to election day the day that donald trump's going to be elected president of the united states and he was and we had like 20 000 people out after midnight and when he arrived he gave a talk like from one in the morning to two in the morning the enthusiasm was incredible but i'll never forget what he said to me when he came off the stage the crowd was thundering it was two in the morning early on election day he came walking off that stage he slapped me on the shoulder and he said mike i don't know about you this doesn't look like second place and it still does it michigan we're gonna deliver a but i encourage you to do like you did before right after you vote with a four years friend [Music] and lastly i just say one more thing you know as i've traveled all across this country the last four years i've come to two foreign convictions america is a freedom of nation and america is a nation of faith and for all the time you turn on the television like a question i got from a little girl at the end of the vice presidential debate you turn on the tv and it seems like people are always arguing it seems like it's more deficient than ever before i truly do believe that this will always be more that unites us in this country that could ever divide us [Music] so i would just say to each one of you as we work as we work to get out of the bubbles remember those ancient words that americans have clung to in much more challenging times and if his people were he'll hear from heaven and he'll heal his life it is one nation under god indivisible with liberty and justice for all so pray for america pray for all of the american people so thank you all for coming out thank you for your enthusiasm i got a plane to catch and we're going to take this message all across america but i leave here today with renewed confidence and if all of us do all we need to do in the next 20 days all across the state of michigan we're going to make michigan and america a more prosperous scenario we're going to make michigan and america safely today john came to the united states in a new republican majority in the congress and with

it's great to be here with some incredible people you join me in thanking congressman david rouser he is an incredible conservative voice an ally for this administration every day [Applause] and also i'm honored to be here the next superintendent of public instruction for north carolina catherine truman is with us to all my fellow americans from near and far i know it's been a long time since the president was here in north carolina he was here yesterday i'm here today because we love north carolina it is great to be back so thank you all for coming out take a seat if you have one i really honored today in the middle of the day but i'm here for one reason and one reason and that is that north carolina and america need four more years of president donald trump in the white house it's on north carolina the president was in greenville yesterday and i'm here to settle today because the road to victory goes straight through north carolina just like last night you know four years ago a movement was born the movement of everyday americans from every walk of life we're all part of that it's amazing to be back on the farm i was talking to another friend from north carolina earlier today he told me about that uh that thursday before election day when you all gathered here maybe some of you are here 17 500 people strong four years ago this month it laid a pathway for victory in north carolina and victory all across america i mean here in north carolina you believe we could be strong again you believe we could be prosperous again you said yes to president donald trump when he visited the farm back in 2016 so i thought i'd come back to make sure that north carolina says yes to president donald trump we're back and it really is great to be with you all we've been traveling all across the country this last week i've been in michigan and wisconsin florida yesterday and i was uh i was actually in utah some people think i did all right but you know honestly because that debate was not just a debate between two candidates it was a debate between two visions it was a debate between a vision that i believe would lead our nation on an inexorable path for socialism and decline in the vision of a president an administration and a people that will lead to more freedom and more opportunity for every american you know when you compare the biden-harris agenda with our agenda the choice is clear if you cherish faith and freedom and law and order and life in 18 days we need to re-elect president donald trump for four more years you know it's amazing to think about all the progress four years ago when you gathered here at the farm with a candidate donald trump we were inheriting a military that had been hollowed out by years of devastating budget cuts our economy was struggling to break out of the slowest recovery since the great pressure terrorism was on the rise around the world and we're still we witnessed a steady assault on our most shared values but in our first three years all that changed we provided for the common defense we cut taxes we rolled back regulation unleash american energy supported law enforcement life and liberty and the constitution of the united states of america and i have to tell you standing here about an hour away from one of the largest and most important military bases in the world the home of the airborne and special operations forces north carolina should be proud every day of the men and women of fort bragg i visited those amazing soldiers not long ago on their behalf and it is the proud father of the united states marine and the father-in-law of the united states i am proud to report to you that under president donald trump's leadership in less than four years we've rebuilt our military we've restored the arsenal of democracy and we are finally giving our soldiers sailors marines coast guard and space force the resources and support that they need to defend this nation president donald trump has actually signed the largest increase in our national defense since the days of ronald reagan that includes 300 new tanks and we passed the largest military pay raise for our men and women in uniform in more than 10 years and with that renewed american strength we've taken the fight to radical islamic terrorists on our turns on their soil in fact last year america's special forces captured the last inch of territory of the isis caliphate and they took down their leader without one american casualty abu bakr you know that that mission was named operation failure it was named after an incredible young woman when i was in salt lake city when joe biden was vice president of the united states our military came to the white house said that the number carrier was being held by daddy she was held for 18 months and dealt with inexplicable terrors and abuse the history of courts when they came to the white house under the obama administration our military had planned to go in but they delayed fully for a month and by the time our special forces went in they arrived on the scene and all the evidence suggested that taylor miller had been moved two days before it's about the age of my two daughters i can't even imagine the loss of that family experience and they said they truly believed if president donald trump had been president that things would be different caleb in real time aerial video coming in as operation caleb mueller descended on abba buckerback daddy and took him down justice sir president donald trump will never hesitate to use the power of the american military to protect the american people so we've rebuilt our military and under president trump's leadership we revive this economy we jump started in an economy that literally was going through the slowest recovery since the great was vice depression they tried to tax and spend and regulate america back into a growing economy president trump in our first three years we cut taxes across the board we rolled than any back in american history we unleash american energy fought for free and fair trade and businesses large and small created more than seven million good paying jobs including 240 000 jobs right here and i have to tell you as the son of the heartland myself i grew up with a cornfield in my backyard i couldn't be more proud standing in this beautiful north carolina park to serve alongside a president who has always fought for family farmers and ranchers every single day you know when we cut taxes the president uh made it possible for what's called immediate expensing of equipment anybody knows anything about farming knows the input cost is the biggest challenge so it was a tremendous farmers with the cost of equipment of a combine and a really good tractor that reminds me of the story of a farmer that women see his lawyer he said he had a problem with a neighbor the lawyer said do you have a good case he said [Applause] and president trump has been fighting for foreign [Music] and we reformed that rule and took a stand for private property and thanks to the president's leadership when we passed that tax cut bill we repealed the inheritance tax for nearly every family farmer in america death is no longer a taxable event that's how you keep the family farm in the family in north carolina so we stood for our security we stood for prosperity in the city and on the farm and every single day president donald trump is still strong for the rule of law as i stand here today i'm proud to report we've seen more than 230 conservative men and women confirmed to our federal courts at every level and they are all jurors who will uphold the god-given liberties enshrined in our constitution like the freedom of religion the freedom of speech and the second amendment right and let me tell you that that level of uh success literally transforming our judiciary in three and a half short years would not have been possible without the strong and consistent support of senator tom tillis so north carolina right after you get done re-electing president donald trump for four more years we need you to send senator tom tillis back to the united states senate for six more years you know last month we rightly paused to honor the life and service of the late justice ruth bader yesterday but when the memorials were over president trump fulfilled his constitutional duty and he nominated a brilliant principled conservative woman who loves the constitution to the supreme court of the united states judge amy coney barrett she's amazing one of the reasons why we could continue to call on democrats to give judge barron a respectful and dignified confirmation but we had reasons to be concerned based on the democrat ranking member of the judiciary committee actually said she was concerned about judge barrett's catholic faith she said quote the dogma lives loudly within you and hollywood started off this time just the same criticizing her faith and her convictions but i got news for the democrats that dogma lives loudly in me that dogma lives loudly in you and that dogma and the right to live to work to worship according to the dictates of your faith lives loudly in the constitution of the united states of america no the their senators to advise senator i'll make your prediction judge amy coney baron will soon be justice amy coney barrett [Applause] you know what we're talking about the supreme court with nine judges on the supreme court of the united states [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] the last night during a town hall on one of the networks joe biden actually said when you're running for the highest office in the land the american people deserve to know if you're going to respect [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] and cal cunningham to come clean give the american people a straight answer you know the truth of the matter is we all know i was born supreme court with liberal judges if they win but make no mistake about it [Music] a republican majority in the united states senate and we're going to re-elect president donald trump for four more years we're going to stand for the rule of law and an independent judiciary [Music] [Music] were stepped is an independent judiciary and president donald trump has stood every single day with the men and women who serve on the thin blue line of law enforcement and we always will you know the president i know you all know the men and women who put on the uniform of law enforcement across this [Music] and they deserve the respect of every american every single day you know my uncle was a police officer for 25 years when i was growing up in that small town in southern indiana we used to drive up to chicago on the holidays in my grandparents living room when my uncle would come out of his bedroom with that uniform and a sidearm we just look up at him in awe all of my heroes wear uniforms now the president i will always support invite every american to the peaceful protest and enshrined in our constitution but rioting and living is not peaceful burning businesses is not free speech i was in indianapolis not long ago i traveled there with a wonderful african-american business owner named westbrook flora told me about the salon she discovered 35 years ago on a street in minneapolis the pillar of the community and how just two days after the killing of george floyd she watched this violent protesters getting closer and closer and closer until the night they burned her salon to the ground she and i stood there along with her first song and i looked her in the eye and i told her we're going to make our streets safe again for every american of every race [Applause] that's all we heard as people around this country literally watch businesses like floors burned around the truth is joe biden would double down on the very policies that are leading to violence when you withdraw support for those who protect and serve you only emboldened those who would do harm to our families that america is in his words systemically racist and he says that police have quote implicit bias against under president donald trump we're going back to blue we're not going to defund the police not now not ever we are going to have law and order in every city in every state for every american of every race and creed and color so help us god and supporting the african-american families and minorities that live in our major cities the truth is our administration has been supporting law enforcement some four thousand new police officers on the streets we launched operation legends we saw violence rise in our major cities but i also couldn't be more proud to be vice president to a president that saw the lowest unemployment ever recorded for african americans we saw the record invested in historically black colleges and universities so well represented here in north carolina we passed opportunity zones that have created investment and we support school choice so that any american any race or income can choose the children go to school we've supported law enforcement supported our african-american communities and we're going to do both for the next four years [Applause] [Music] so we stood for the rule of law [Music] and from day one this president has stood strong for the right of every american to live to work to worship according to the victims you know when joe biden was vice president we saw a steady assault on the religious freedom of america it's true it's amazing to think the last administration literally hauled the little sisters of the poor into federal court to force that group of nuns to take a vow of lifetime poverty simply to serve the underserved community call them in the federal court to force them to compromise compromise their faith to live under the scriptures of obamacare trump we've restored the constant rights of doctors nurses teachers and religious charities and we ended the assault on the little sisters of the war and the supreme court of the united states made it permanent by vote of 72. i can tell you people of faith have no greater champion than president donald trump and finally and finally where joe biden and colin support taxpayer funding of abortion all the way up to the moment of increases birth largest abortion provider in america and want to fund and promote abortion around the world i couldn't be more proud to serve alongside a president who stands without apology for the sanctity of human life president donald trump is the most pro-life president in american history so we rebuilt our military we revived our economy we stood for all order of liberties in life did it all in the first three without the years and consistent support of north carolina's delegation of congress that's why when you re-elect president donald trump we need north carolina to send congressman david rouser congressman richard hudson and madison california and all the republicans in the house back to a new republican majority and retired nancy policy once and for all let's get it done i mean it's amazing [Applause] you look at what we were able to accomplish republican majorities in the house and the senate those first two years under this president's leadership in our first three years we made america great again true transmission happened in february in the month of january president donald trump did what no american president had ever done he put the help of americans first he suspended all travel from china in the world now joe biden said that was hysterical he said it was xenophobic [Music] president donald trump's decision to shut down all travel from china saved hundreds of thousands of american lives and bought us time to stand up the greatest national mobilization since world war ii [Music] medical supplies and equipment to our incredible doctors and nurses we've developed medicines that are literally saving lives across the country and we are on track to have the first safe and effective coronal virus vaccine before the end of this year that's leadership and let me say on behalf of the president and the first lady how much we've all been by the outpouring of prayers and concern [Music] and the prayers that americans have for all of those who have struggled every day over these last eight months so can we just take a moment just give a round of applause the nurses the caregivers the first responders and everyone who's been there for family members neighbors and friends who've suffered lost and struggled in the midst of this pandemic and i promise you we're going to keep leaning we're making sure that our doctors and nurses and hospitals have all the resources we're going to keep saving lives we'll soon have a vaccine and literally millions of doses available under operation in fact today the president announced the plan with cbs and walgreens to deliver and administer vaccines to our seniors and nursing homes for free all across america as soon as it's available so we're making progress where joe biden is talking about shutting down the economy under president donald trump we're opening up america again after losing 22 million jobs to the height of this pandemic in just the last five months we've seen 11.5 million americans already go back to work including 266 000 people right here we're opening up america and we are opening up america's schools i'm proud to report to you and we just authorized the distribution of over 100 million rapid tests 15-minute tests and we're shipping them out to school nurses and administrators all across america so we can get our kids back in the classroom and keep them back in the classroom safely where they belong it's not just been about what's happening in the classroom we're back in the gridiron the acc has been back for nearly a month tar heel football is back wolf pack football in his back pirates football is back and in a week i heard the targets of the wolf pack are going to be facing off at keene stadium how much do you love football in the fall i don't care who you are in 18 as dramatic as the choice was in 2016. i will tell you i think the choice has never been clear the stakes it's amazing joe biden wants to raise taxes by four trillion dollars right at the time that we're looking for businesses to open their doors to put americans back to they want to work american businesses with higher taxes the trump tax cuts on day one that would actually be the average in the midst of an american comeback that's putting more americans back to work every day the last thing we need to do is to have joe biden raising taxes on every american and every american business president trump not only cut taxes before we're going to keep cutting taxes for middle-class americans for four more years it's not just about taxes joe biden wants to bury our economy under an avalanche an important framework yeah it says [Music] where we have the cleanest air and land ever recorded literally the cleanest water in the world and we're still in that exporter of energy for the first time instead of the year we can do it all can protect our environment and be energy independent that's the leadership of president donald trump and the president is talking today about seniors it seems like every time an election gets a little closer the democrats start talking about what republicans are going to do i'm here to tell you as president said today down in fort myers security and medicare every single day and we're going to protect it every day for four more years we lowered the cost of prescription drugs in fact medicare freedom advantage premiums actually fell by 34 where under uh 100 when joe biden's vice president prices literally skyrocketed and if you look at joe biden have a far left health care plan that literally threatens private health insurance and limit your choice of doctors remember he actually wants to keep obamacare going obamacare was a disaster remember they said if you like your doctor you keep not true wasn't true they said the church were going to go down [Music] by the he's got a time option in his obamacare and bernie sanders has been bragging not long ago that he's going to be the one writing health care reform if they win and they win the white house with four more years president donald trump and i are going to give the american people but we're going to lower the cost of health insurance without growing the size of government and we will say with one voice america will never be a socialist country we're going to reject socialized medicine and we're going to give americans medicine and health care based on free market principles and consumer choice beyond healthcare the choice in this election couldn't be clear when it comes to trade so important in a place like north carolina you know when we took office was with china we were losing 500 billion dollars a year to come joe biden every step of the way it's true he said that the rise of china economically gave rise to those incredible deficits was a positive development president trump we put china is over he imposed paris and demanded that china open their markets to what we grow and what we make and respect the private property rights of every american and when it comes to our neighbors to the north and south i don't know about you here in north carolina 25 years after we literally saw entire communities shutters factories closed and jobs moved south of the border for all those 25 years to reform [Music] is gone the usmca is here to say it's a huge win for north carolina north agriculture manufacturing in fact i'm told i'm actually told that experts suggested that we're going to sell 2.2 billion more in agricultural exports to canada and mexico alone now you all deserve to know though joe biden is one of the 10 members of the senate to vote against the us she said it didn't go far enough on climate change kamala harris put her radical and environmental agenda ahead of north carolina's farmers north carolina's president donald trump and i are always going to put american farms and american workers first so when you look at the choice joe biden says and i think our economic recovery is on the ballot i think law and order are on the ballot but i also think there are things much more foundational to our country that are on the ballot [Music] more conservative or more liberal more red or blue i think the choice in this election is america whether we're going to chart a course on all the ideas of freedom and individual the responsibilities dream or whether we're going to let joe biden the democratic party and the radical left take america to a very different place less freedom less opportunity than a future american decline so let me say for our freedom for all the ideals we need to decide right here and right now that joe biden will never be president of the united states of america we're going to re-elect president donald trump for four more years [Music] [Applause] it's that important being here being here with all of your privilege let me also say the greatest church of my life to serve as your vice president the greatest privilege of my life i really didn't know him that well before he called me up and asked me to join this ticket a lot more than four years ago i never forget the night i was at the governor's residence in indiana and i told paul was coming in my wife and i prayed all the way through that i've seen this uh seeing this man up close i've seen his leadership i knew he had the right vision to bring his country back it's about eleven o'clock in the phone right my wife at my side i picked up the phone and i heard that familiar voice and he said mike it's gonna be great and then he said he said we're gonna have to work we're gonna have to go outside [Music] and you know what he was right we made america great again in three short years four more years we're gonna make america even greater sale but it's going to take all of us against unprecedented opposition this prison hasn't gotten up and fought to keep the promises that he made to the people of this country now it's our turn to fight for him it's on north carolina we need to bring it so i got a couple things i want to ask you to do over the next 18 days first off i need you to vote north carolina i need you to vote for four more years of president donald trump in the white house you know early voting started we finish up yesterday if you don't have plans i'd like you to go over to the richard harrison gymnasium 601 west noble street president donald trump and remember friends don't let friends vote alone bring a family member bring in a neighbor bring a co-worker and vote to re-elect this president secondly [Applause] 45 minutes of everything we've done we face as a nation you know what i got to tell you four years ago i just i never doubted i never doubted something very special that's happening across the country and i feel just the same way now because the truth is we can have an economy that works for everybody and opens the american dream to every american again we can have a government that respects our values and our freedoms and our highest ideals we're talking to each other so that's what i need you to do you just want to leave here your heart today talk to someone you're going to make the difference 2020 just like you did in 2016. and finally i um [Applause] where the spirit of the lord is freedom so that when we stand for freedom when we stand with those who are fighting for freedom and defending freedom that means freedom always how many times the nazarene told us to consider the farmer consider the farmer who patiently wastes to the land to yield his valuable crop waiting for the rain to fall and spring as you reach out and talk to your neighbors and friends every day over the next 18 days to continue to have courage and have faith that he who has seen this nation through much more challenging times than we could possibly imagine he's still with us today because god isn't done with america yet so pray for america pray for all the americans and i'm absolutely between our election day to vote to spread the word and to pray we're going to see another great victory all across north carolina and all across america we're going to make north carolina and america safer than ever we're going to make north carolina and america more prosperous than ever before and with congressman david richard hudson madison calthor and all their colleagues in a new republican majority in the house of representatives with senator tom tillis in a renewed republican majority in the united states senate with president donald trump in the white house for four more years and with god's help we will make america great again again thank you very much thank you north carolina god bless you and god bless

when PRON look at the choice joe biden say and i think PRON economic recovery be on the ballot i think law and order be on the ballot but i also think there be thing much more foundational to PRON country that be on the ballot music more conservative or more liberal more red or blue i think the choice in this election be america whether PRON be go to chart a course on all the idea of freedom

140,ngxj1TFPx_Q,pence,2020-10-19T21:27:48Z,Pence campaigns in Pennsylvania,speech,hello pennsylvania thank you all for coming out today my fellow americans very far it is great to be back in the keystone state just 15 days away from a great victory and all across america and it really is an honor to be with all of you it's also an honor to be with some incredible allies of this administration and the congress of the united states i know you heard from him a little bit earlier but would you join me in thanking congressman scott perry congressman lloyd and congressman frank these are great heroes who come with us every step of the way and it's also great to be here with a guy you just heard from a proud penn state grad grew up here in pennsylvania in a small business family he worked construction but he's the man our president chose to fight for american jobs and level the playing field on international trade and he's the next congressman from pennsylvania's eighth congressional [Applause] district really great to be here great friends but speaking of friends of mine this might be the first time that i've ever had to follow president trump at a rally how great was that in arizona and he's going to be here in erie tomorrow we're traveling all over the country for one reason and one reason only and that's that pennsylvania and america need four more years of president donald trump [Applause] it's on and the road to victory runs right through pennsylvania it's true but i'm really grateful you all are out today the president and i are traveling constantly constantly he was in nevada yesterday in carson city i've been traveling a fair amount myself was in maine earlier today [Music] about 10 days ago i was in salt lake city utah we had a little debate with uh some people think we did all right and i can't wait till president trump takes the stage in the next village but i'll tell you it's a privilege for me to be out in every setting talking about this record you think about it four years ago a movement was born a movement of everyday americans from every walk of life and the progress that we've made has truly been incredible when we took office in 2016 we'd seen years of reckless cutbacks that had hollowed out our military strength terrorism was on the rise we were living through the slowest economic recovery since the great depression and our most cherished values were under continual assault out of washington dc but in three short years we rebuild our military with less taxes less regulation we unleashed american energy supported our border patrols law enforcement like liberty and the constitution of the united states it all begins with providing for the common defense and i have to tell you it's amazing to think after years of those reckless cut backs in our national defense when joe biden's vice president years when we took office where literally there was a large portion of aircraft in the air force that were grounded and being used for spare parts to keep other aircraft in the air well i have to tell you as the proud father of a marine corps aviator i'm proud to report to you that president trump signed the largest increase in our national defense since the days we're finally giving our soldiers sailors airmen marines and coast guard the resources and support that they need to accomplish their mission and defend this nation we've taken the fight to radical islamic terrorists on our terms on their soil last year at the direction of our commander-in-chief america's forces took the last inch of territory under the black flag of isis and took down their leader without unamerican casualty and when american lives were threatened by the most dangerous terrorists in the world president donald trump took action and we took casa salamani off the battlefield but we haven't just stood up for our enemies we stood with our allies it was president donald trump who kept a promise that four previous presidents has made when he moved the american embassy to jerusalem so we stood with our allies and in our first three years after this after an administration they tried to borrow and spend and bail and tax our way back to a growing economy under president trump's leadership with these great allies in the congress we created the greatest economy in the history of america in the midst of a global pandemic joe biden wants to raise taxes by four trillion dollars i mean he said in the vice presidential debate that on day one he was going to repeal the trump tax cuts that would be a tax increase of roughly 2 000 for the average family of four across america making more than fifty thousand dollars a year it's true president trump by contrast we cut taxes across the board for working families and federal red businesses than any administration in history we fought for free and fair trade unleash american energy and american businesses created seven million good paying jobs those first three years or the policies of these great members of congress support we saw not only jobs created but wages rising i mean i got to tell you when i was governor state of indiana indiana's awful lot like pennsylvania you know you do two things well you make things and you grow things and the truth is that wages haven't been moving under the last administration there were many years under the last administration when joe biden was vice president that wages didn't even keep up with inflation it's so working families were falling behind because of the policies that this president advanced i'm proud to report to you in our first three years wages were rising at their fastest pace in 10 years and they rose most rapidly for hard-working blue-collar americans it wasn't just about our economy on health care you all remember the disaster of obamacare right i mean remember the big lies in the last administration they said if you like your doctor you can keep you like your health insurance you keep why they said insurance premiums were going to go down why well the first two things weren't true they were actually called the biggest political lies in 10 years and the last one you know insurance premiums had doubled when president trump and i took office and joe biden's got a plan to add what he calls a public option to obamacare that would set us on an inevitable path to socialized medicine president trump we've been fighting every day to lower the cost of health insurance without growing the size of government using the power of the free marketplace we lowered the cost of prescription drugs and under president donald trump america will never be a socialist country we're going to give the american people the health care that you deserve and that you want and we're going to build it on american principles we're going to let people buy health insurance the way you buy car insurance and the way you buy life insurance across state lines to competitive marketplace [Music] and i'll tell you what when it comes to jobs and trade when we took office half of the international trade deficit of the united states was with communist china we were losing 500 billion dollars a year in our trading relationship with china it's true go by he's been a cheerleader for communist china all along in fact the rise of china was a positive thing and he went on that he went on to try and dismiss the idea that china was even a competitor and closer to home as we saw factories close all across the heartland in the 25 years since nafta joe biden never lifted a finger you know the truth is when joe biden was vice president america actually lost 200 000 manufacturing temples and remember when the last president was asked about he said those manufacturing jobs were never coming back he said and i quote what magic wand do you [Applause] donald have in the white house because this president told china the era of economic surrender is over he stood strong imposed tariffs in order to keep standing strong until china opens their markets and after decades when democrats were complaining about nafta the guy that wrote the art of the deal got america a better deal nafta is gone and the usnca is here so it's been about jobs it's been about opportunity it's been about our free market it's been about trade it's also been about energy i don't have to tell you here in pennsylvania president donald trump has been a champion for american energy independence we ended the war on coal and america is now a net exporter of energy for the first time in 70 years [Music] [Applause] pennsylvania is an energy-rich state low-cost energy drives economic growth in this state all across america but in this state it literally supports hundreds of thousands of jobs we all deserve to know joe biden and the radical left want to crush american energy under a two trillion dollar version of the green new deal [Music] their green new deal would literally raise the cost of electricity for every household and every business in pennsylvania and joe biden and kamala harris want to abolish fossil fuels end fracking and destroy hundreds of thousands of jobs here in pennsylvania now i know they're saying different now right hey joe biden goes to pittsburgh a little while back tried to convince people across this state that he's not for banning fracking did you see him and he actually said he actually said our president was lying about his record even though joe biden and kamala harris have repeatedly promised to ban fracking and you don't have to take my word for it theirs would there be any place for fossil fuels including coal and fracking in the final administration make sure it's eliminated and no more subsidies for either one of them and i think it's critically important on day one that we end any fossil fuels [Music] [Applause] biden and kamala harris are going to abolish fossil fuels and ban fracking but we're not going to let it happen we're going to have more fracking more american energy more energy independence when we re-elect president donald trump for four more years i got to tell you i can't wait to see if he denies it again at the next presidential debate it kind of reminds me of what groucho marx said he said who are you going to believe me or your own eyes folks president trump said it well the other day he said you know he said honestly when politicians say one thing then another the first thing they say is usually the closest thing to the truth i just figured you all deserve to see it for yourself i mean we got a choice to make men and women all across the state across the country i mean whether it be taxes whether it be regulation whether it be their health care reform their plan to send us on a path to socialize medicine whether it be their plan to abolish fossil fuels and ban fracking or go back to economic surrender you've got to ask yourself and ask your neighbors who do you think can bring this economy all the way back i mean do you think this economy is going to come back with a career politician who spent 47 years raising taxes stifling our economy and engaging in economic surrender on trade are we going to bring this economy back with a proven job creators [Applause] [Music] [Applause] so we've been fighting for our security our prosperity american energy and american workers and president donald trump every step of the way stood strong for the rule of law i'm proud to report to you as i stand here today this president has seen confirmed more than 230 conservative judges to our federal courts and i can tell you what i'm saying they are all men and women who will hold all the god-given freedom of liberties to agree with the second amendment right and at a time when big tech is actually trying to censor what americans read or see or say president trump and i will always fight for the american people's right to know we're not going to let big tech block the truth [Applause] now last month we paused as a nation to honor the life and service of the late ruth bader ginsburg justice but when the memorials were over president trump fulfilled his constitutional he duty a brilliant principled conservative woman supreme court of the united states did you see all the notes she brought up with her i told her that was my favorite part of the hearing here you go thank you beauty i i think the world of judge barrett and it's not just because she's from indiana i'll tell you what these are serious times she's an incredible choice for this president it's one of the reasons why the president and i called on democrats this time to give judge barry respectful and dignified confirmation and we have reason to be concerned you'll remember a couple years ago when she is being confirmed to the court of appeals the number one democrat on the judiciary committee actually criticized her catholic faith she said it was a concern because in her words she said the dogma lives loudly within you and hollywood elites have already begun to criticize your faith well i got news for the democrats and their friends in hollywood that dogma lives loudly indeed [Applause] [Music] according to the dictates of our faith so the city's got a job to do and after they discharged their duty to advise and consent i'll make your prediction judge amy coney barrett [Applause] is going to be justice amy cody now speaking of the supreme court people of pennsylvania deserve to know after 150 years with nine seats on the supreme court leading democrats in washington dc are talking about packing the court literally adding seats so they can put left-wing activist judges on the supreme court to advance their agenda [Music] a thursday night in his town hallman much of a town hall did you see that i mean seriously those weren't softballs those were beach balls while president trump's over on another network taking fast balls across the plate and he's getting every one of them out of the fire all right in his tv town hall meeting the other night was asked straight up about heart packing and he said quote i'm open to considering kamala harris's running mate said in the primaries that she was quote absolutely open to packing the court and then she refused to answer the question straight up when i asked her in our vice president and then a couple of spokespeople for the biden campaign were on tv yesterday morning said yeah totally one of them was the senator who would be voting right now now joe biden is telling us that he'll tell the american people what he's going to do after judge barrett is confirmed in a week or so even though millions of americans are already voting i heard getting off the plane 27 million americans have already cast their vote so come on man the american people deserve a straight answer when you're running for the highest office in the land the american people deserve to know if you're going to respect the highest court in the land [Applause] you know i mean we all know what's going on here though mean we were born in the morning but not yesterday morning i mean joe biden and kamala harris are going to pack the court with liberal activist judges if they win this election but we're not gonna let it happen we're gonna re-elect president donald trump for four more years [Music] president donald trump has stood with the incredible men and women who serve on the thin blue line and that includes the courageous men and women of customs and border protection and ice [Applause] you know where joe biden wants open borders taxpayer-funded health care free lawyers for illegal immigrants president donald trump has stood strong for border security we've made record investments in border security we've supported customs and border protection and ice and we've already built more than 300 miles of that border wall on the southern corner of the united states and with four more years we're going to build it all it's been about standing standing with those who wear the uniform and i have to tell you when i was a little boy growing up in a small town in southern indiana we'd load up the station wagon and go up to my grandparents home in chicago and there i remember being there with my three brothers we're all real little my uncle would come out to go to work in the morning he'd be wearing that blue uniform badge on his shirt sidearm at his side he's a member of the chicago police department for 25 years you know all of my heroes wear uniforms the men and women who serve in law enforcement at every level of this country deserve the respect of every american every single day you know president trump and i will always support the right of america's peaceful protest it's enshrined in our constitution [Music] [Applause] and those who perpetrate violence against civilians who destroy property who assault and attack law enforcement will be prosecuted to the fullest extent for months all joe biden talked about was peaceful protests remember all summer long as americans in major cities here in pennsylvania and all across america literally watch their businesses and their communities burn truth is do abide in a double down on the policies that have led to violence in america when you withdraw support from those who protect and serve you only embolden those who would do harm to our families in our community that's right joe biden justifies it all by saying in his words that america is systemically racist [Music] and he says he and his running mate believe that police officers in this country have a quote implicit bias against and when he was asked to meet support cutting funding for law enforcement joe biden replied yes absolutely israeli man said that we needed to reimagine policing in america and she applauded the mayor of los angeles when he cut 150 million dollars out of the lapd [Music] let me make your promise under president donald trump we're going to back the blue yeah [Applause] president and i know what you all know we don't have to choose between supporting law enforcement and supporting our african-american neighbors and families and minorities that live in our major cities we've done both for the last three and a half years and we're going to keep doing both for four more years think about under president trump we funded 4 000 new police officers through the cops program violence broke out in our major cities we deployed operation legend named after a four-year-old boy that had been killed in his own bed and violence in his city and at the same time i couldn't be more proud to be vice president to a president who saw the lowest unemployment rate ever recorded for africa america is the highest funding ever for historically black colleges and universities for supporting educational choice for all of our families criminal justice reform and opportunities with four more years we're going to keep supporting law enforcement and keep supporting education jobs opportunities and public safety for our african-american neighbors and all of our neighbors we're gonna have law and order in every city and every state in this nation for every american of every race so we've stood for the rule of law for law and work and with those who protect and serve and president donald trump has stood every day for the religious freedom of every american of everything yes [Music] [Applause] joe biden was we literally saw a steady assault on the freedom of religion in the administration and in our courts i mean the last administration actually hauled the little sisters of the poor into federal court to force them to compromise their faith to live under the strictures of obamacare they did the same thing with businesses that whose principles and values ran contrary to their agenda under president trump we restored the conscious rights of doctors nurses teachers and religious charities and president trump ended the assault on the little sisters of the poor and the supreme court but you all deserve to know after the supreme court agreed with us the little sisters of the poor ought to be able to live out their faith joe biden actually said that he's elected president he's going to haul him back in court again i promise you four more years of president donald trump you will have a president who is the greatest champion of people of faith [Music] i have to tell you i couldn't be more proud to be vice president to a president who stands without apology for the sanctity of human life where joebine and kamala harris support taxpayer funding of abortion president donald trump is the most pro-life president in american history so in our first three years we rebuilt our military we revived our economy we stood for law and orders liberties and life let me tell all of you none of that would have been possible without the strong and principled support of pennsylvania's republican delegation to congress that's why right after you vote to re-elect president donald trump for four more years we need pennsylvania to send congressman scott perry congressman lloyd to a new republican majority that retires nancy pelosi once and for all you know i'm going to tell you when you look at all that we accomplished in those first three years working shoulder to shoulder with these great allies it's only one way you can describe under president trump's leadership in just three short years we made america great again and then 2020 came along and the coronavirus struck fortune but i'm here to tell you before the first case of community spread happened anywhere in this country president trump did what no american president had ever done in our history he closed off all travel from china he put the health of america first now pennsylvania you should know joe biden criticized the president's decision to shut off all traffic he said it was xenophobic he said it was hysterical he actually wrote that it would make things worse but i can tell you as the head of the white house coronavirus task force president trump's decision to shut down all travel from china bought us invaluable time to stand up the greatest national mobilization since world war ii and it saved untold american lives we reinvented tessa we saw the manufacturer and the distribution of billions of medical supplies to our incredible doctors and nurses and health care workers we developed new medicines called therapeutics that are literally saving lives every day and we are just weeks away from having the first coronavirus vaccine with tens of millions of doses able to deliver in less than a year because of the compassion and care that americans have shown one another because of the incredible contributions of our doctors and nurses and first responders because of the seamless partnership we've forged with state health officials all across the country and because of this president's leadership seeing our way through this panda and every day we're one day closer to putting the coronavirus and i promise you in the days ahead we're going to keep making sure those doctors and nurses have all the supplies they need to give any america struggling gonna keep protecting the vulnerable we're gonna keep saving lives and we're gonna open up america again now it's amazing to think in the height of this pandemic we lost 22 million jobs in this country but because of that solid foundation that president trump poured in our first three years because of the unprecedented recovery and relief efforts that these congressmen provided to families and to businesses across this country we've already seen 11 and a half million americans go back to work including almost 600 [Applause] we're opening up america again and we are opening up america's schools just in the last two weeks we uh we authorized the distribution of over 100 billion point of care rapid tests to send them out to school nurses all over the country so that we can get our kids back in the classroom where they belong and even their safe and sound it's not just getting them back in the classroom thanks to president donald trump big ten football is back too from this saturday [Applause] we're going to keep fighting our way through this year but you know what when you look at when you look at their agenda higher taxes open borders a green new deal defunding the police packing the court abortion it's clear joe biden would be nothing more than a trojan horse for the radical life now joe biden says that democracy is on the ballot i heard his running mate echoed that down in florida but i think our economic recovery isn't i think law and order are on them but i also think there's things much more foundational to who we are as americans in this election i think it's not going to be so much whether we end up more republican or more democrat more red or more blue more liberal or more conservative i think the choice in this election is whether america remains american it's whether we're going to chart a course based on our highest ideals of freedom free enterprise personal responsibility and our most cherished values patriotism in the american flag or whether we're going to take a hard left turn to more government less freedom socialism joe biden and the radical left want to take america somewhere we have never been before so for our freedom and all the ideas that have always made america great we need to decide right here and right now that joe biden will never be president of the united states [Applause] [Music] for the last four years and i can tell you against unprecedented opposition from the democrats in washington and their allies in the meeting there's never been a day gone by that this president hasn't gotten up and fought to keep the promises that he made to the people of pennsylvania now it's our turn i got a couple things i want to ask you to do okay first i need you to vote pennsylvania vote for four

we're going to win this election finally uh you know there's a little girl asked a question at the end of our vice presidential event since you've turned it on the tv it seemed like people were more divided in this country than any time before but you know as i've traveled all across america the last four years i'm actually more convinced than ever that there's always be more that unites us in these united states the chief among those and things is a nation of faith everywhere i go i was in maine earlier today i suspect i'll hear it again today before i leave people to reach out across a rope line say to me or say to the president i'm praying [Music] [Applause] so as as we all make sure that we vote with a friend as we tell the story in the days i'd encourage you to avail yourself of

144,X_GInHCSOEc,pence,2020-10-21T18:55:50Z,VP Pence holds 'Make America Great Again!' event,speech,economic recovery since the great depression terrorism was on the rise around the world and we'd witnessed a steady assault on our most cherished values but in three short years we rebuild our military we revived the american economy we secured our border supported law enforcement stood for life liberty and the constitution of the united states of america it's been america first and america first all starts with the national defense you know when we took office we'd seen years of reckless budget cuts to our national defense when joe biden was vice president of the united states but president donald trump he actually signed the largest investment in our national defense since the days of ronald reagan and i have to tell you not just as your vice president but as the proud father of a united states marine and the father-in-law of a united states navy pilot i couldn't be more proud to serve alongside a president who has fought every day to give our men and women of our armed forces the resources and the support that they need to defend this nation we're doing it we've rebuilt our military we haven't just stood with those who haven't just stood with those who wear the uniform we've stood with those who've worn the uniform of the united states i mean are there veterans in the audience today could you put your hand or your hat in the air just give us a chance to say thank you one more time thank you for your service thank you for your service it's amazing to think when we took office we go through years of scandals at the va you all remember here in new hampshire when joe biden was vice president we literally had veterans who were perishing waiting to receive treatment at va hospitals when president donald trump walked into the oval office everything changed we passed the most sweeping reforms of the va in 50 years we fired thousands of va employees that were not giving our veterans the care that they earned in the uniform of the united states and veterans choice is now available for every veteran in america so we stood strong with those who serve and we'd sit strong with those who did so and all along the way president donald trump revived our economy with the time-honored principles of freedom free markets and free enterprise and after the slowest recovery since the great depression we created the greatest economy in american history it's amazing to think when joe biden was vice president they tried to tax and spend and bail and regulate their way back to a growing economy you remember those things i mean the american economy recovered in spite of the policies of the obama by the administration and now in the midst of a global pandemic joe biden wants to raise taxes by four trillion dollars just at a time that america is coming back president trump we cut taxes across the board for working families and businesses large and small we rolled back more federal red tape than any administration in history we fought for free and fair trade that put america first we unleashed american energy and in just three short years seven million jobs were created by businesses large and small including 19 000 jobs right here in the granite state i mean i'm proud to report to you under president trump's policies and leadership average hourly earnings grew faster in our first three years than in all eight years when joe biden was vice president and wages rose most rapidly for hard-working blue-collar americans the forgotten men and women of america were forgotten no more you know and on health care you all remember the disaster of obamacare remember the big three promises they said if you like your doctor you can keep that wasn't true they said if you like your health insurance you can keep it that wasn't true they said health insurance premiums would go down you know when we took office health insurance premiums had actually doubled in the wake of obamacare and now joe biden wants to double down on the failed policies of obamacare he and kamala harris actually support adding a public option to obamacare straight out of bernie sanders agenda it'll set us on an inevitable path to socialize medicine but under president donald trump we're going to keep lowering the cost of health insurance without growing the size of government we've lowered the cost of prescription drugs we passed right to try we're going to have the best health care in the world and we will never be a socialist country so it's been about jobs it's been about prosperity rolling back red tape giving the american people a health care system built on the principles of free enterprise when it comes to economic policy our international trade here in new hampshire and all across america is vitally important the truth is when we took office half of our international trade deficit was with communist china joe biden's been a cheerleader for communist china all along the way and closer to home in the decades that followed the passage of nafta remember democrats always used to like to talk about everything that was wrong with nafta but joe biden never lifted a finger to reform nafta as literally thousands of factories closed across the country and those jobs were shipped south of the border and overseas it's amazing to think after all those empty promises and all those failed policies president trump stepped into the oval office we put china on notice we said the era of economic surrender is over we impose tariffs on china and will keep standing strong on china until they open their markets to american goods and protect the private property rights of american enterprise and on nafta the guy that wrote the art of the deal got america a great deal nafta is gone the usmca is now the law of the land and energy is a critical part it's a critical part of family budgets and business budgets and a growing economy you all in new hampshire deserve to know joe biden and the radical left want to crush american energy under a 2 trillion version of the green new deal it would literally raise the cost of electricity for every household and every business in new hampshire i mean it's incredible when you think about it i mean president trump actually had to remind joe biden in that last presidential debate that he supported the great new deal but i gotta tell you very much difference between aoc green new deal and joe biden and kamala harris's green new deal and that's just how usa today identified i mean the truth is joe biden is talking about mandates out of washington dc that would stifle american jobs and economies he said he wants to abolish fossil fuels in this country under president donald trump we've unleashed american energy and under the policies of this president we've developed the vast natural resources of this nation and we're now a net exporter of energy for the first time in 70 years now when joe biden was vice president you all might remember america actually lost 200 000 manufacturing jobs you remember the last president that summertime in 2016. i heard he's in philadelphia today but he probably won't bring this up so i will the last president actually said that those manufacturing jobs in america were never coming back 200 000 were gone for good right i mean from you know i'm from out in the heartland and these people like calling our neck to the woods the rust belt and there was a lot of rust on the belt when they were in charge right remember barack obama said what magic wand do you have well we didn't need a magic wand we just needed president donald trump in the white house five hundred thousand manufacturing jobs created in just three years including three thousand right here in new hampshire i mean it's just incredible when you think about the progress that we make this president has been a champion all along the way of american jobs and american workers as i stand before you today men and women we have a choice to make a truthful in this election come november 3rd it's going to be a choice between a trump recovery and abiding depression i mean just yesterday a nonpartisan study came out that said under joe biden's economic policies america would lose 5 million jobs and the average household income in america in the coming years would drop by thousand five hundred dollars a year it's no real surprise when you're gonna raise taxes by four trillion dollars we're gonna drop a two trillion dollar version of the green new deal on top of the american economy when you're talking about driving out and abolishing american energy and going back to economic surrender it's no surprise i mean in every day between now and election day you gotta you gotta ask yourself your neighbors and your friends of worship and at work i mean who do you really think is going to bring this economy all the way back is it a proven job creator that put timeless free market principles into practice and saw seven million jobs created or a career politician who spent 47 years in washington raising taxes stifling our economy under an avalanche of regulation and economic surrender so men and women of new hampshire for our families for our jobs for economic freedom and the american comeback we need four more years of president donald trump in the white house so it's been about security it's been about prosperity we fought for american energy and american workers in every step of the way president donald trump has stood for the rule of law i'm proud to report to you that as i stand here today this president's appointed more than 200 conservatives to our federal courts at every level and they are all men and women who will uphold the god-given liberties enshrined in our constitution like the freedom of religion the freedom of speech and the second amendment right to keep and bear arms and i'll tell you what we'll always defend the freedom of speech and the freedom of the press at a time when big tech is actually trying to censor what americans read or see or say we're going to take a stand you all might have seen yesterday the justice department launched an anti-trust lawsuit against google while big tech is trying to protect joe biden president donald trump and i will always fight to protect your freedom of speech we're not gonna let big tech block the truth not now not ever when you think of the rule of law we think of last month we paused as a nation to rightly honor the life and service of the late justice ruth bader ginsburg but when the memorials were over president trump fulfilled his constitutional duty and he nominated a remarkable [Music] principle conservative woman who loves the constitution to the supreme court of the united states he nominated judge amy coney barrett isn't she great now the president and i are calling on democrats to give judge barrett a respectful and dignified confirmation but we have reason to be concerned and you all remember a couple years ago during her last confirmation to the court of appeals the leading democrat on the judiciary committee actually criticized judge barrett's catholic faith she said it was a concern saying and i quote the dogma lives loudly within you and hollywood elites have already begun to criticize judge barrett's faith well i got news for the democrats and their friends in hollywood that dogma lives loudly in me that dogma lives loudly in you and the freedom to live to work to worship according to the dictates of our faith lives loudly in the constitution of the united states of america it's who we are it's our freedom so the senate's got a job to do and after they discharge their duty this week and early next to advise and consent i'll make you predictions judge amy coney barrett is going to be justice amy coney barrett we're going to fill that seat on the supreme court of the united states now while we're talking about supreme court people here in this freedom-loving state deserve to know after 150 years with nine justices on the supreme court of the united states leading democrats in washington are actually talking about backing the program adding seats to the court so they can appoint liberal activist judges to drive their agenda from the judicial branch mean last saturday last thursday night joe biden said in his town hall that he's quote open to considering packing the court kamala harris said in the primary she was quote absolutely open and when i when i asked her during the vice presidential debate what the answer was she refused to give me a straight answer now joe biden is telling the american people that he'll tell us what he's going to do after judge barrett is confirmed next week even though millions of americans are voting right now i mean come on man the american people deserve a straight answer when you're running for the highest office in the land you gotta tell america whether you respect the highest court in the land am i right i mean come on you know i was born in the morning but not yesterday morning we all know the answer joe biden and kamala harris aren't answering the question because we already know the answer joe biden democratic party and the radical left are going to pack the court with liberal activist judges if they win this election but we're not going to let it happen we're going to re-elect a republican majority in the senate and we're going to re-elect president donald trump for four more years the stakes are just that high many women pack into court like these democrats are planning to do that be the greatest power grab in american history we got to talk to our neighbors and friends about it and about the states i mean it's just one more reason by right after you reelect president donald trump you've got to send corky messner to the united states senate corki messner will stand for the constitution the rule of law and independent judiciary so we've stood for the rule of law and every single day i've served alongside this president i've seen it president donald trump has stood with the men and women who serve on the thin blue line of law enforcement and we always will you know the president i know what you know that is the men and women who put on the uniform of law enforcement are the best people in this country in every day they put on that uniform and strap on a sidearm they walk out the door kiss their families goodbye they count our lives more important than their own those who serve in law enforcement deserve the respect of every american every single day would you all mind showing these police officers who are with us today just how much we appreciate the job they do when they protect and serve our families every day thank you for that you know president trump and i will always support the right of peaceful protest enshrined in the constitution but rioting and looting is not peaceful protest burning businesses is not free speech and for months all joe biden and his running mate talked about were peaceful protesters remember literally as we saw businesses in our major cities burned to the ground i was in minneapolis just a few weeks ago standing at uh the ruins of uh a flora westbrook salon floor is a wonderful african-american business owner started that salon in minneapolis 35 years ago it became a centerpiece of the community and she told me the story about just days after the killing of george floyd how she saw the violent protesters come closer and closer and closer to her business until the night they burned her up men and women i'm gonna tell you i told flora that day we're going to rebuild we're going to rebuild bigger and better than ever before and we're going to have law and order for her and for every american in every city of every race and creed and color so help us god i mean the truth is joe biden would double down on the policies that are leading to violence in our major cities when you start to erode support for those who protect and serve our families you just embolden those who would do violence for those we love and to our community now joe biden explains it all by saying that america is in his words systemically racist and he and his running mate repeatedly say that police officers have a quote implicit bias against minorities when he was asked if he support cutting funding for law enforcement joe biden said yes absolutely and his running mate kamala harris actually praised the mayor of los angeles for cutting 150 million dollars out of the budget of the lapd let me make your promise under president donald trump we're not going to defund the police not now not ever we're going to back the blue for four more years i mean the president i know what you all know we don't have to choose between supporting law enforcement and supporting our african-american neighbors and friends and minorities and everyone that lives in our cities i mean i couldn't be more proud to be a vice president to a president who supported funding for the hiring of four thousand new police officers when violence outbreak that broke out this summer we literally searched federal officials in operation legend every major city in the country and we've arrested nearly 3 000 violent offenders already restoring peace to our streets but at the same time in that same period of time because of this president's policies we saw the lowest unemployment ever recorded for african americans we created more than 8 000 opportunity zones for inner city families we signed historically black colleges universities their largest budgets ever and made them permanent and we have fought for educational choice for every family in every city in america so i promise you we're going to keep supporting law enforcement we're going to keep supporting our african-american neighbors with more jobs more opportunities better education more public safety and we're going to do it all for four more years so we stood for the rule of law stood with those who defend our families at home and abroad and when it comes to values i couldn't be more proud to serve alongside a president who has stood for the religious freedom of every american of every faith every single day president donald trump is the greatest champion of people of faith in america in my lifetime and i couldn't be more proud to serve alongside a president who stands without apology for the sanctity of human life you all deserve to know that joe biden and kamala harris actually support taxpayer funding of abortion all the way up to the moment of birth they're calling for historic increases to planned parenthood of america and they want to restore funding to promote abortion around the world but i promise you president donald trump is the most pro-life president in american history and we're going to stand for the right to life for four more [Music] years so in our first three years amazing to think what we all accomplished we rebuilt our military we revived our economy we stood for law and order liberties and life and that's why that's why we need to not only re-elect president donald trump for four more years not only send corey messner to the united states senate but we need to send matt mowers to a new republican majority in the united states house of representatives and retired nancy pelosi once and for all i mean when you look at what we were able to accomplish when we had republican majorities in the house and the senate men and women in new hampshire you know the job before it's amazing to think in three short years president of the white house with our allies in the house and the senate only one way you can describe it in three short years we made america great again right we just did and then 2020 hit and the corona virus struck from china but i can tell you firsthand before the first documented case of community spread in the united states president trump did what no american president had ever done before he suspended all travel from china the second largest economy in the world now joe biden said that was xenophobic he said it was hysterical he actually wrote a few days earlier that that banning travel from anywhere in the world would actually make things worse but i can tell you joe biden's wrong as head of the white house coronavirus task force i can i can attest firsthand president trump's decision to suspend all travel from china saved untold american lives and it bought us invaluable time to stand up the greatest national mobilization since world war ii we reinvented testing we saw to the manufacturer in the distribution of billions of supplies we've created new medicines called therapeutics that are literally saving lives every single day and we're just a matter of weeks away from having the first safe and effective coronavirus vaccine and tens of millions of doses available for the american people that's what leadership looks like in fact the president just announced last week a plan with cvs and walgreens to deliver and administer vaccines to our seniors in nursing homes for free all across america the moment it becomes available i mean with the incredible cooperation of the people of this state and this country putting the health of your families and neighbors first with our incredible doctors and nurses health care providers and first responders with the partnership at the state level and the leadership of this president we're protecting the vulnerable we've given the american people everything we need to make sure that anyone impacted by the coronavirus has the support to get the health care that we want any member of our family to have and we're saving lives and where joe biden is talking about shutting down the economy we're opening up america again i mean in just the last five months after losing 22 million jobs at the height of this pandemic with that strong foundation that president trump poured with your support in our first three years with the unprecedented relief and recovery efforts four trillion dollars made available to families and businesses we've already seen eleven and a half million americans go back to work including sixty 61 000 people right here in new hampshire we're opening up america and we're opening up america's schools i'm proud to report to you mr pence is already back in the classroom teaching at a little christian school just outside our nation's country so we're going to keep those supplies rolling until the day comes that we have that vaccine and we can put this coronavirus in the past and for all the progress we made it's a testament to our president's leadership an incredible free enterprise system great research companies great doctors and nurses let me also say it is a testament here in new hampshire the strong and compassionate leadership of governor chris sununu so we're moving our country forward we've gone through a time of testing but in just 13 days we're going to come to a time for choosing which is why i'm out here and you're out here in the drizzle today in new hampshire you know when you look at their agenda higher taxes open borders socialized medicine a green new deal defunding the police packing the courts it's clear joe biden would be nothing more than a trojan horse for the radical left now joe biden says that democracy is on the ballot well i think our economic recovery is on the ballot i think law and order are on the ballot but i think there are things much more foundational to our nation i think in this election it's not so much whether we're going to end up more republican or more democrat more conservative or more liberal more red or more blue new hampshire the choice in this election i believe is whether america remains american it's going to be a choice of whether we build a future on all the timeless principles enshrined in that constitution benjamin franklin walked out independence hall and he was asked in 1787 what former government they'd created he said a republic if you can keep men and women i think this is a choice such time as this this choice about whether we're going to keep the republic it's whether we're going to chart a course based on freedom limited government the ideals and the liberties and the principles enshrined in our founding document or whether we're going to let joe biden and the democratic party take us on a path of american decline so let me say for our freedom for our republic for all the ideals that have always made america great we need to decide right here and right now that joe biden will never be president of the united states we're going to re-elect president donald trump for four more years and with four more years as the president says we're gonna accomplish so much for this country with four more years we'll distribute a vaccine and we'll defeat the virus four more years we'll maintain america's unrivaled military might and ensure peace through american strength the four more years we'll make america into the manufacturing superpower of the world and end reliance on china once and for all we'll uphold religious liberty freedom of speech the right to keep and bear arms we'll hire more police we will ban sanctuary cities we will stop the indoctrination of our students and restore patriotic education in our schools and as president trump said that mount rushmore will teach our children to love our country honor our history and always respect our great american flag and we'll live by those timeless words your motto is live free or not our motto is all of us is in god we trust and i got to tell you men and women in new hampshire i'm just very grateful you came out on a soggy day to see your vice president i'm really very honored i have to tell you it's the greatest honor of my life to be your vice president and i thank you for that great honor and for your support you know i actually didn't know the president very well before he called me four years ago and asked me to join this ticket but we've got to be very close some people think we're a little bit different but i got to tell you i've seen this president when all the cameras are off and all the bright lights are off and i can tell you firsthand having served shoulder to shoulder with him over these last four years there has never been a day that president donald trump against unprecedented opposition and attacks there has never been a day president donald trump hasn't gotten up and fought to keep the promises that he made to the people of new hampshire now it's our turn to fight for him it's on new hampshire it's on so before i get back on that plane and head to ohio i got a couple things to ask of you over the next 13 days first thing i need you to do is vote new hampshire vote to re-elect president donald trump to the white house and i heard the last day to register before the election here in portsmouth it's going to be next wednesday october 28th so if you're not registered yet go to the city clerk's office on one junkins avenue normal wednesday hours 8 a.m to 4 30. there's still time if you're not registered to vote get registered to vote today in fact i checked out on the way here you can go and request an absentee ballot until election day you can mail it in and drop it off at the very same location mr pence and i are going to do that in the hoosier state in just a couple days so we need you to vote new hampshire and remember friends don't let friends vote alone grab a family member grab a neighbor grab a co-worker and vote to re-elect president donald trump okay so after you vote with a friend second thing i wanted to ask you to do is just go tell somebody okay i mean i got to tell you four years ago i never doubted that this president was going to win in that election and i don't doubt it today because i know the american people then and now we're talking to each other i mean the people of this state knew we could be strong again you knew we could be prosperous again you were talking to your neighbors and friends about those timeless ideals of this country and you saw in donald trump not just the vision but the leadership qualities to make america great again and so go tell your neighbors and friends say you know i went out to the airport the other day it was raining and mike came out he ran every bit as fast as he could and then he talked to us like for an hour out in the rain just about everything we've done about the choice that we face and about everything we can do for america with four more years of president donald trump in the white house you got to go tell him so after you vote with a friend after you tell your neighbors and friends every day for the next 13 days i encourage you to do one more thing you know traveling all across this country over the last four years i'm convinced of two things in this live free or dive state this is a freedom loving nation and this is a nation of faith i mean i had a little girl in that vice presidential debate turned in a question at the end where she said she was watching tv and it just looked like there was so much that divides us but after traveling across america i'm more convinced than ever that there will always be more that unites us in these united states of america than will ever divide us and chief among those things is of faith in the american people and so if you're among those who on occasion bend the knee and bow the head over the next 13 days i encourage you to do that too and when you pray pray with confidence those ancient words that if his people who are called by his name will humble themselves and pray and turn that he'll do like he's always done in the long and storied history of this state and nation he'll hear from heaven and he'll heal this land this one nation under god indivisible with liberty and justice for all so pray for america pray for all of the american people it'll make a difference new hampshire so thanks again for coming out today you all are just you're like the greatest i can't wait to get on the phone

on the fail policy of obamacare PRON and kamala harris actually support add a public option to obamacare straight out of bernie sander agenda PRON will set PRON on an inevitable path to socialize medicine but under president donald trump PRON be go to keep lower the cost of health insurance without grow the size of government PRON have lower the cost of prescription drug PRON pass right to try PRON be go to have the good health care in the world and PRON will never be a socialist country so PRON be be about job PRON be be about prosperity roll back red tape give the american people a health

PRON take office half of PRON international trade deficit be with communist china joe biden be be a cheerleader for communist china all along the way and closer to home in the decade that follow the passage of nafta remember democrats always use to like to talk about everything that be wrong with nafta but joe biden never lift a finger to reform nafta as literally thousand of factory close across the country and those job be ship south of the border and overseas PRON be amazing to think after all those empty promise and all those fail policy president trump step into the oval office PRON put china on notice PRON say the era of economic surrender be over PRON impose tariff on china and will keep stand strong on china until PRON open PRON market to american good and protect the private property right of american enterprise and on nafta the guy that write the art of the deal get america a great deal nafta be go the usmca be now the law of the land and energy be a critical part PRON

version of the green new deal PRON would literally raise the cost of electricity for every household and every business in new hampshire i mean PRON be incredible when PRON think about PRON i mean president trump actually have to remind joe biden in that last presidential debate that PRON support the great new deal but i get to tell PRON very much difference between aoc green new deal and joe biden and kamala harris green new deal and that be just how usa today identify i mean the truth be joe biden be talk about mandate out of washington dc that would stifle american job and economy PRON say PRON want to abolish fossil fuel in this country under president donald trump PRON have unleash american energy and under the policy of this president PRON have develop the vast natural resource of this nation and PRON be now a net exporter of energy for the first time in year now when joe biden be vice president PRON all may remember america actually lose manufacturing job PRON remember the last president that summertime in i hear PRON be in philadelphia today but PRON probably will not bring this up so i will the last president actually say that those manufacture job in america be never

be in charge right remember barack obama say what magic wand do PRON have well PRON do not need a magic wand PRON just need president donald trump in the white house five hundred thousand manufacturing job create in just three year include three thousand right here in new hampshire i mean PRON be just incredible when PRON think about the progress that PRON make this president have be a champion all along the way of american job and american worker as i stand before PRON today man and woman PRON have a choice to make a truthful in this election come november rd PRON be go to be a choice between a trump recovery and abide depression i mean just yesterday a nonpartisan study come out that say under joe biden economic policy america would lose million job and the average household income in america in the come year would drop by thousand five hundred dollar a year PRON be no real surprise when PRON be go to raise taxis by four trillion dollar PRON be go to drop a two trillion dollar version of the green new deal on top of the american economy when PRON be talk about drive out and abolish american energy and go back to economic surrender PRON be no surprise i mean in every day between now and election day PRON get to PRON got to ask PRON PRON neighbor and PRON friend of worship and at work i mean who do PRON really think be go to bring this economy all the way back be PRON a prove job creator that put timeless free market principle into practice and see seven million job create or a career politician who spend year in washington raise taxis stifle PRON economy under an avalanche of regulation and economic surrender so man and woman of new hampshire for PRON family for PRON job for economic freedom and the american comeback PRON need four more year of president donald trump in the white house so PRON be be about security PRON be be about prosperity PRON fight for american energy and american worker in every step of the way president donald trump have stand for the rule of law PRON be proud to report to PRON that as i stand here today this president appoint more than conservative to PRON federal court at every level and PRON be all man and woman who will uphold the god give liberty enshrine in PRON constitution like the freedom of religion the freedom of speech and the second amendment right to keep and bear arm and PRON will tell PRON what PRON will always defend the freedom of speech and the freedom of the press at a time when big tech be actually try to censor what americans read or see or say PRON be go to take a stand PRON all may have see yesterday the justice department launch an anti trust lawsuit against google while big tech be try to protect joe biden president donald trump and i will always fight to protect PRON freedom of speech PRON be not go to let big tech block the truth not now not ever when PRON think of the rule of law PRON think of last month PRON pause as a nation to rightly honor the life and service of the late justice ruth bader ginsburg but when the memorial be over president trump fulfil PRON constitutional duty and PRON nominate a remarkable music principle conservative woman who love the constitution to the supreme court of the united states PRON nominate judge amy coney barrett be not PRON great now the president and i be call on democrats to give judge barrett a respectful and dignified confirmation but PRON have reason to be concern and PRON all remember a couple year ago during PRON last confirmation to the court of appeal the lead democrat on the judiciary committee actually criticize judge barrett catholic faith PRON say PRON be a concern say and i quote the dogma live loudly within PRON and hollywood elite have already begin to criticize judge barrett faith well i get news for the democrats and PRON friend in hollywood that dogma live loudly in PRON that dogma live loudly in PRON and the freedom to live to work to worship accord to the dictate of PRON faith live loudly in the constitution of the united states of america PRON be who PRON be PRON be PRON freedom so the senate get a job to do and after PRON discharge PRON duty this week and early next to advise and consent PRON will make PRON prediction judge amy coney barrett be go to be justice amy coney barrett PRON be go to fill that seat on the supreme court of the united states now while PRON be talk about supreme court people here in this freedom love state deserve to know after year with nine justice on the supreme court of the united states lead democrats in washington be actually talk about back the program add seat to the court so PRON can appoint liberal activist judge to drive PRON agenda from the judicial branch mean last saturday last thursday night joe biden say in PRON town hall that PRON be quote open to consider pack the court kamala harris say in the primary PRON be quote absolutely open and when i when i ask PRON during the vice presidential debate what the answer be PRON refuse to give PRON a straight answer now joe biden be tell the american people that PRON will tell PRON what PRON be go to do after judge barrett be confirm next week even though million of americans be vote right now i mean come on man the american people deserve a straight answer when PRON be run for the high office in the land PRON get to tell america whether PRON respect the high court in the land be i right i mean come on PRON know i be bear in the morning but not yesterday morning PRON all know the answer joe biden and kamala harris be not answer the question because PRON already know the answer joe biden democratic party and the radical left be go to pack the court with liberal activist judge if PRON win this election but PRON be not go to let PRON happen PRON be go to re elect a republican majority in the senate and PRON be go to re elect president donald trump for four more year the stake be just that high many woman pack into court like these democrats be plan to do that be the great power grab in american history PRON get to talk to PRON neighbor and friend about PRON and about the state i mean PRON be just one more reason by right after PRON reelect president donald trump PRON have get to send corky messner to the united states senate corki messner will stand for the constitution the rule of law and independent judiciary so PRON have stand for the rule of law and every single day PRON have serve alongside this president PRON have see PRON president donald trump have stand with the man and woman who serve on the thin blue line of law enforcement and PRON always will PRON know the president i know what PRON know that be the man and woman who put on the uniform of law enforcement be the good people in this country in every day PRON put on that uniform and strap on a sidearm PRON walk out the door kiss PRON family goodbye PRON count PRON life more important than PRON own those who serve in law enforcement deserve the respect of every american every single day would PRON all mind show these police officer who be with PRON today just how much PRON appreciate the job PRON do when PRON protect and serve PRON family every day thank PRON for that PRON know president trump and i will always support the right of peaceful protest enshrine in the constitution but rioting and looting be not peaceful protest burn business be not free speech and for month all joe biden and PRON running mate talk about be peaceful protester remember literally as PRON see business in PRON major city burn to the ground i be in minneapolis just a few week ago stand at uh the ruin of uh a flora westbrook salon floor be a wonderful african american business owner start that salon in minneapolis year ago PRON become a centerpiece of the community and PRON tell PRON the story about just day after the killing of george floyd how PRON see the violent protester come closer and closer and closer to PRON business until the night PRON burn PRON up man and woman PRON be go to tell PRON i tell flora that day PRON be go to rebuild PRON be go to rebuild big and well than ever before and PRON be go to have law and order for PRON and for every american in every city of every race and creed and color so help PRON god i mean the truth be joe biden would double down on the policy that be lead to violence in PRON major city when PRON start to erode support for those who protect and serve PRON family PRON just embolden those who would do violence for those PRON love and to PRON community now joe biden explain PRON all by say that america be in PRON word systemically racist and PRON and PRON running mate repeatedly say that police officer have a quote implicit bias against minority when PRON be ask if PRON support cut funding for law enforcement joe biden say yes absolutely and PRON running mate kamala harris actually praise the mayor of los angeles for cut million dollar out of the budget of the lapd let PRON make PRON promise under president donald trump PRON be not go to defund the police not now not ever PRON be go to back the blue for four more year i mean the president i know what PRON all know PRON do not have to choose between support law enforcement and support PRON african american neighbor and friend and minority and everyone that live in PRON city i mean i could not be more proud to be a vice president to a president who support funding for the hiring of four thousand new police officer when violence outbreak that break out this summer PRON literally search federal official in operation legend every major city in the country and PRON have arrest nearly violent offender already restore peace to PRON street but at the same time in that same period of time because of this president policy PRON see the low unemployment ever record for african americans PRON create more than opportunity zone for inner city family PRON sign historically black college universitie PRON large budget ever and make PRON permanent and PRON have fight for educational choice for every family in every city in america so i promise PRON PRON be go to keep support law enforcement PRON be go to keep support PRON african american neighbor with more job more opportunity well education more public safety and PRON be go to do PRON all for four more year so PRON stand for the rule of law stand with those who defend PRON family at home and abroad and when PRON come to value i could not be more proud to serve alongside a president who have stand for the religious freedom of every american of every faith every single day president donald trump be the great champion of people of faith in america in PRON lifetime and i could not be more proud to serve alongside a president who stand without apology for the sanctity of human life PRON all deserve to know that joe biden and kamala harris actually support taxpayer funding of abortion all the way up to the moment of birth PRON be call for historic increase to plan parenthood of america and PRON want to restore funding to promote abortion around the world but i promise PRON president donald trump be the most pro life president in american history and PRON be go to stand for the right to life for four more music year so in PRON first three year amazing to think what PRON all accomplish PRON rebuild PRON military PRON revive PRON economy PRON stand for law and order liberty and life and that be why that be why PRON need to not only re elect president donald trump for four more year not only send corey messner to the united states senate but PRON need to send matt mower to a new republican majority in the united states house of representatives and retire nancy pelosi once and for all i mean when PRON look at what PRON be able to accomplish when PRON have republican majority in the house and the senate man and woman in new hampshire PRON know the job before PRON be amazing to think in three short year president of the white house with PRON ally in the house and the senate only one way PRON can describe PRON in three short year PRON make america great again right PRON just do and then hit and the corona virus strike from china but i can tell PRON firsthand before the first document case of community spread in the united states president trump do what no american president have ever do before PRON suspend all travel from china the second large economy in the world now joe biden say that be xenophobic PRON say PRON be hysterical PRON actually write a few day earlier that that ban travel from anywhere in the world would actually make thing bad but i can tell PRON joe biden wrong as head of the white house coronavirus task force i can i can attest firsthand president trump decision to suspend all travel from china save untold american life and PRON buy PRON invaluable time to stand up the great national mobilization since world war ii PRON reinvent test PRON see to the manufacturer in the distribution of billion of supply PRON have create new medicine call therapeutic that be literally save life every single day and PRON be just a matter of week away from have the first safe and effective coronavirus vaccine and ten of million of dose available for the american people that be what leadership look like in fact the president just announce last week a plan with cvs and walgreen to deliver and administer vaccine to PRON senior in nursing home for free all across america the moment PRON become available i mean with the incredible cooperation of the people of this state and this country put the health of PRON family and neighbor first with PRON incredible doctor and nurse health care provider and first responder with the partnership at the state level and the leadership of this president PRON be protect the vulnerable PRON have give the american people everything PRON need to make sure that anyone impact by the coronavirus have the support to get the health care that PRON want any member of PRON family to have and PRON be save life and where joe biden be talk about shut down the economy PRON be open up america again i mean in just the last five month after lose million job at the height of this pandemic with that strong foundation that president trump pour with PRON support in PRON first three year with the unprecedented relief and recovery effort four trillion dollar make available to family and business PRON have already see eleven and a half million americans go back to work include sixty people right here in new hampshire PRON be open up america and PRON be open up america school PRON be proud to report to PRON mr pence be already back in the classroom teaching at a little christian school just outside PRON nation country so PRON be go to keep those supply roll until the day come that PRON have that vaccine and PRON can put this coronavirus in the past and for all the progress PRON make PRON be a testament to PRON president leadership an incredible free enterprise system great research company great doctor and nurse let PRON also say PRON be a testament here in new hampshire the strong and compassionate leadership of governor chris sununu so PRON be move PRON country forward PRON have go through a time of testing but in just day PRON be go to come to a time for choosing which be why PRON be out here and PRON be out here in the drizzle today in new hampshire PRON know when PRON look at PRON agenda high taxis open border socialize medicine a green new deal defunde the police pack the court PRON be clear joe biden would be nothing more than a trojan horse for the radical left now joe biden say that democracy be on the ballot well i think PRON economic recovery be on the ballot i think law and order be on the ballot but i think there be thing much more foundational to PRON nation i think in this election PRON be not so much whether PRON be go to end up more republican or more democrat more conservative or more liberal more red or more blue new hampshire the choice in this election i believe be whether america remain american PRON be go to be a choice of whether PRON build a future on all the timeless principle enshrine in that constitution benjamin franklin walk out independence hall and PRON be ask in what former government PRON would create PRON say a republic if PRON can keep man and woman i think this be a choice such time as this this choice about whether PRON be go to keep the republic PRON be whether PRON be go to chart a course base on freedom limited government the ideal and the liberty and the principle enshrine in PRON found document or whether PRON be go to let joe biden and the democratic party take PRON on a path of american decline so let PRON say for PRON freedom for PRON republic for all the ideal that have always make america great PRON need to decide right here and right now that joe biden will never be president of the united states PRON be go to re elect president donald trump for four more year and with four more year as the president say PRON be go to accomplish so much for this country with four more year PRON will distribute a vaccine and PRON will defeat the virus four more year PRON will maintain america unrivaled military may and ensure peace through american strength the four more year PRON will make america into the manufacturing superpower of the world and end reliance on china once and for all PRON will uphold religious liberty freedom of speech the right to keep and bear arm PRON will hire more police PRON will ban sanctuary city PRON will stop the indoctrination of PRON student and restore patriotic education in PRON school and as president trump say that mount rushmore will teach PRON child to love PRON country honor PRON history and always respect PRON great american flag and PRON will live by those timeless word PRON motto be live free or not PRON motto be all of PRON be in god PRON trust and i get to tell PRON man and woman in new hampshire PRON be just very grateful PRON come out on a soggy day to see PRON vice president PRON be really very honored i have to tell PRON PRON be the great honor of PRON life to be PRON vice president and i thank PRON for that great honor and for PRON support PRON know i actually do not know the president very well before PRON call PRON four year ago and ask PRON to join this ticket but PRON have get to be very close some people think PRON be a little bit different but i get to tell PRON PRON have see this president when all the camera be off and all the bright light be off and i can tell PRON firsthand have serve shoulder to shoulder with PRON over these last four year there have never be a day that president donald trump against unprecedented opposition and attack there have

147,Xwx_9f1zxjk,pence,2020-10-22T21:49:39Z,"Full speech: Vice President Pence holds campaign rally in Waterford Township, Michigan",speech,wahello michigan to congressman molinar to our great state republican chairman laura cox all of my fellow americans near and far thank you for trudging through the mud standing in the rain it is great to be back in the wolverine state and we are just 12 days away from a great victory all across michigan and all across america you got it you got it and it really is great to be here with some friends of ours the son of middle in michigan he's a champion for the 4th congressional district and i'm here to tell you he has fought every single day to advance the agenda that's made michigan and america stronger and more prosperous will you join me in thanking congressman john molinar for his great great leadership in washington dc it's also great to be here with a first-generation american who's worked on the front lines of healthcare serving his community and i know he's going to be the next great congressman from the 11th congressional district let's hear it for eric asaki thanks eric thank you john thank you all for being here but we're here for one reason and one reason only and that is that michigan and america need four more years of president donald trump in the white house and the road to victory runs right through michigan it really is great to be with all of you to think about all we've done you know four years ago a movement was born a movement of everyday americans from every walk of life here in michigan you believe we could be strong again you believe we could be prosperous again michigan said yes to president donald trump in 2016 and i know michigan is going to say yes to four more years of president donald trump in 2020. you know i spoke to the president this morning he's headed out to nashville in just a little bit he is going to take the stage in tennessee and he is going to take the fight to joe biden and i can't wait i'll tell you what it's going to be a great night and a couple weeks ago we had a little debate out in salt lake city thank you some people think we did all right but i got to tell you it was a great privilege for me to be able to be there to talk about all this president has done with the support of all of you good people here in michigan i mean think about it four years ago we inherited a military that had been hollowed out by devastating budget cuts an economy that was struggling to break out of the slowest economic recovery since the great depression terrorism was on the rise around the world and we witnessed a steady assault on our most cherished values but in three short years we rebuild our military we revived our economy we secured our border supported law enforcement stood for life and liberty and the constitution of the united states and you know it all starts with our national defense after years of reckless budget cuts that hollowed out our military truth be told when we took office when we took office there was a percentage of aircraft in the united states air force that were kept on the ground to be used as spare parts to keep other aircraft in the air i mean the truth is that all changed when president donald trump walked into the oval office president trump signed the largest investment in our national defense since the days of ronald reagan and i can attest as your vice president and as the proud father of a united states marine pilot we are finally giving our soldiers sailors airmen marines and coast guard the resources and support they need to defend this nation you know and it's not just been about standing with those who serve in uniform but we've also stood with all of you who have served in the uniform of the united states in fact if you're a veteran of our armed forces would you just mind raising your hand in the air and giving us a chance to say thank you one more time thank you for your service thank you for your service when joe biden was vice president we all remember we saw years of scandal at the va that shocked the conscience of the nation remember that i mean we literally had veterans that were dying waiting to get health care at va hospitals but under president donald trump we signed the most sweeping reforms of the va in 50 years we fired more than 3 000 va employees that weren't given our veterans the care they deserve and veterans choice is now available for every veteran in america support for our troops and their families support for our veterans it's just one more reason why we need four more years of president donald trump in the white house and why we need michigan to send an army combat veteran to washington d.c we need john james in the united states senate so it's about providing for our national defense but in our first three years after joe biden had spent the last the previous eight years trying to tax and spend and regulate us back to a growing economy president donald trump created the greatest economy in american history and now in the midst of a global pandemic joe biden wants to raise taxes by 4 trillion dollars president trump he cut taxes across the board for working families and businesses large and small we rolled back more federal red tape than any administration in history we fought for free and fair trade we unleashed american energy and in just three short years businesses large and small created seven million good paying jobs including a hundred and twelve thousand jobs right here in the wolverine state amazing in our first three years unemployment reached a 50-year low across america it's the lowest unemployment for 20 years in the state of michigan and wages were rising across the board and what means the most of the president is me is wages were rising most rapidly for hard-working blue-collar americans the forgotten men and women of america were forgotten no more and i don't know if you heard about it but just this morning it was announced that weekly jobless claims just hit their lowest level since march michigan is back america's coming back and motor city is back you know it really is great to be in pontiac i think this might be my first visit here and in waterford we're not far from pontiac right it's just as got mentioned great legacy and tradition my first car was a pontiac thought that might do me some good it was we used to flip over the air filter in that thing did you do that when you were young yeah i had a 454 four-barrel in it man that thing that thing would haul and it would make a lot of noise when you flip that air filter i'll tell you let's just hear it for the great tradition of craftsmanship in waterford and pontiac what a great history and under president trump's leadership i'm proud to report to the automotive industry is roaring back all across the state of michigan last year general motors announced they were adding about 400 jobs fiat chrysler already is building a 1.6 billion dollar plant and they committed to 6 400 jobs in the motor city right here in michigan and it's been because of those policies less taxes less regulation but it's also been because we have a president who's been fighting for free and fair trade that puts american jobs and american workers first i mean when it comes to international trade it's amazing to think when we took office half of our international trade deficit was with communist china 500 billion dollars a year we were losing to china in our trading relationship and joe biden he's been a cheerleader for communist china all along the way he actually said the rise of china was a positive development and he dismissed last year the idea that china was even a competitor but under president donald trump we made it clear from day one when it comes to china the era of economic surrender is over we impose tariffs and we're going to stand strong until china opens their markets to what we make and what we grow once and for all and closer to home when it comes to nafta i don't have to tell the people of michigan what this hoosier also knows about nafta i mean in the 25 years since nafta was signed we had 60 000 factories that closed all across america we did many of those jobs moved south of the border and many moved overseas now democrats for years used to talk about how bad nafta was but joe biden never lifted a finger to renegotiate it or reform it but under the man who wrote the art of the deal america got a better deal nafta is gone and the usmc is here to stay and it's a win for michigan and a win for america i don't know if you knew it but under the usmca 75 percent of auto parts and duty-free cars have to be made in north america and 40 percent of them have to be made by workers making the average hourly wage that workers make in the united states of america now the people of michigan deserve to know not only that joe biden never lift a finger to reform nafta but when it came time to replace it with the usmca his running mate kamala harris was one of only 10 senators to vote against the usmca in the senate she said the usmca didn't go far enough on climate change kamala harris put her radical environmental agenda ahead of michigan auto workers and michigan auto jobs it's one more reason why michigan needs to say no to joe and yes to four more years of president donald trump and the white house and when it comes to energy so important in a manufacturing state like michigan and all across this country joe biden and the radical left want to crush american energy under a two trillion dollar version of the green new deal remember in the last presidential debate president trump had to remind him that he supported the green new deal might have to remind him again tonight i mean their two trillion dollar version of the green new deal would raise the cost of electricity for every home and business in michigan it's true i mean they're talking about requiring four million businesses to be essentially retrofit two million homes to be retrofit to live up to joe biden kamala harris and aoc's green new deal president trump he's been a champion of american energy and american energy independence we ended the war on coal and today america is a net exporter of energy for the first time in 70 years incredible you know when joe biden was vice president america actually lost 200 000 manufacturing jobs and the last president who i saw was out on the campaign trail yesterday he said those jobs were never coming back do you remember i mean they referred to our part of the country as the rust belt and there was a lot of rust on the belt when they were in charge remember after president obama said that those jobs were never coming back he said quote what magic wand do you have well we didn't need a magic wand we just needed president donald trump in the white house 500 000 manufacturing jobs in just three years including 17 000 jobs right here in the state of michigan manufacturing is back and when it comes to health care even on health care you all remember their plans remember obamacare all the promises that they made the last administration joe biden's vice president he said if you like your doctor you can keep it wasn't true they said if you like your health insurance you can keep it wasn't true they said health insurance premiums would go down when we took office health insurance premiums had doubled under obamacare and joe biden has a plan to literally take the socialized medicine option of bernie sanders and put it right in the middle of obamacare it would send us on an inevitable path to socialized medicine here in michigan and all across america president donald trump we got rid of the individual mandate we've been fighting to lower the cost of health insurance without growing the size of government we've lowered the cost of prescription drugs medicare advantage premiums dropped by 54 in this state we're gonna have the best health care system in the world even better and america will never be a socialist country men and women of michigan we got a choice to make you got to talk to your neighbors and friends about it when you trudge back through that field to get back to your cars and god bless you for it i mean honestly when you think about our economy i really do believe the choice that come november 3rd here in michigan is between a trump recovery and abiding depression there's this non-partisan study congressman molinar i don't know if you saw it just came out a day ago it said that under joe biden's economic policies america would lose 5 million jobs and the average income of a typical american family would drop by 6 500 a year so you got to ask yourself and your neighbors and your friends in every day between now and election day who do you really think can bring this economy all the way back and then some a career politician who spent 47 years in washington raising taxes stifling our economy under an avalanche of regulation and economic surrender or a proven job creator who will keep cutting taxes rolling back red tape and fighting for american jobs and american workers for our families for our jobs for an american comeback like we have never seen we need four more years of president donald trump in the white house so we've stood for security so we stood for security we fought for prosperity fought for american energy and american workers and president donald trump has stood strong for the rule of law as i stand here today i'm proud to report to you that our president has already appointed more than 230 conservatives to our federal courts at every level and they are all men and women who will uphold the god-given liberties in our constitution like the freedom of religion the freedom of speech and the second amendment right to keep and bear arms now last month we rightly paused as a nation to honor the life and service of the late justice ruth bader ginsburg but when the memorials were over president trump fulfilled his duty under the constitution of the united states when he nominated a brilliant principled conservative woman who loves the constitution to the supreme court he nominated judge amy coney barrett isn't she great isn't she great i'll tell you i'm a little partial i mean she is from indiana and you know president trump and i we called on democrats in washington to give judge barrett a respectful confirmation and we're going to keep calling on them but we have reason to be concerned i mean you all remember during her last confirmation hearing don't you the ranking member on the judiciary committee democrat from california actually said she was concerned about judge barrett's nomination because of her catholic faith she said and i quote the dogma lives loudly within you and hollywood elites have been criticizing judge barrett ever since well i got news for the democrats and their friends in hollywood that dogma lives loudly in me that dogma lives loudly in you and the right to live and work and worship according to the dictates of our faith lives loudly in the constitution of the united states of america now the senate is going to continue to discharge their duty to advise and consent and i'm proud to report even though democrats didn't show up the senate judiciary committee voted judge amy coney barrett out of the committee she's headed to the floor for a vote on monday and i'll make you a prediction come this monday judge amy coney barrett is going to be justice amy coney barrett we're going to fill that seat on the supreme court now the people of michigan deserve to know after 150 years with nine justices on the supreme court leading democrats in washington are talking about packing the court adding seats to the supreme court so they can nominate radical leftist judges to advance their agenda from the judicial branch now joe biden did say that he was going to tell the american people what he'd do about court packing after judge barrett was confirmed now he's saying he's he's going to tell us after the election i mean i saw a clip this morning on the way here he told 60 minutes it's a live ball he's going to tell us after the election after millions of americans have cast their votes whether he's going to pack the court in what would be the biggest power grab in american history i mean come on man the american people deserve a straight answer joe when you're running for the highest office in the land the american people deserve to know whether you're going to respect the highest court in the land i mean we know what's going on here don't we i mean i tell people i was born in the morning but not yesterday morning i mean look joe biden and kamala harris aren't telling us what they're going to do because joe biden and kamala harris are going to pack the court with liberal activist judges if they win this election but we're not going to let it happen we're going to re-elect president donald trump for four more years and we're going to send john james to a larger republican majority in the united states senate we're going to stand for the rule of law and an independent judiciary i promise you that amen and every day since this president took office i'm proud to say that we have stood without apology for the men and women who serve on the thin blue line of law enforcement and we always will you know the president i know what you know men and women who serve in law enforcement are some of the best people in this country they're people that literally get up every day and count our lives is more important than their own and those who serve in law enforcement deserve the respect of every american every day in fact it kind of comes with uh comes with the job description we got a lot of law enforcement people around me would you mind just showing them how much you appreciate all the law enforcement people that are here today can we just say thank you to them and their families for all they do for us every day as they protect and serve thank you all very much you know president trump and i will always support the right of americans to peaceful protests but rioting and looting is not peaceful protest burning businesses is not free speech now all summer long all joe biden ever talked about were peaceful protesters remember as the american people literally watch businesses and communities burned to the ground the truth is joe biden would double down on the policies that have led to violence in america cities i mean when you start to withdraw support from those who protect and serve you only embolden those who would do harm to our families in our communities now joe biden justifies it all by saying that in his words america is systemically racist and he and kamala harris often say that police officers in this country have a quote implicit bias against minorities when joe blind was asked if he'd support cutting funding for law enforcement he said yes absolutely and kamala harris recently praised the mayor of los angeles for cutting 150 million dollars out of the budget of the lapd well let me make you a promise with four more years of president donald trump in the white house we're not going to defund the police not now not ever we're going to back the blue every single day i mean we all know we don't have to choose between supporting law enforcement and supporting our african-american neighbors and friends and minority families and all the families in our cities we have done both for the last three and a half years and we're going to keep doing both for four more years under this president we invested with the strong support of people like john molinar we supported funding in the cops program that allowed for the hiring of four thousand additional police officers when violence broke out in our cities we launched operation legend in cities across the country we worked with state and local law enforcement we've already arrested more than three thousand violent offenders in our cities restoring peace to our streets and at the same time we've been supporting law enforcement i couldn't be more proud to be vice president to a president that saw the lowest unemployment ever recorded for african americans the highest funding for historically black colleges and universities in history we created 8 000 opportunity zones in our major cities past criminal justice reform and we have fought to give educational choice to every family in america this president has proven we can stand with law enforcement stand with our minority families and i promise you we're going to keep doing that and we're going to have law and order in every city in every state in this nation for every american of every race and creed and color so help us god so we've stood for the rule of law stood strong with law enforcement we've also stood by our most cherished liberties you know when joe biden was vice president we saw a steady assault on the freedom of religion the american people one administrative act after another the last administration actually hauled a group of catholic nuns into federal court to force them to compromise their faith to live under the mandates of obamacare president donald trump he restored the conscience rights of doctors and nurses and religious charities and president trump ended the assault on the little sisters of the poor once and for all and beyond our values and our faith i couldn't be more proud to be vice president to a president who has stood without apology for the sanctity of human life where joe biden and kamala harris support taxpayer funding of abortion all the way up to the moment of birth president trump reinstated the mexico city policy that denied federal dollars to any program that promotes abortion around the world and he signed a bill that gave states the right to defund planned parenthood president donald trump is the most pro-life president in american history and we're going to stand for the right to life for four more years so in our first three years think about the progress we made with the strong support of our allies in congress we rebuilt our military revived our economy stood for law and order liberties in life but i want to say from my heart none of that would have been possible without the strong and consistent support of michigan's republican delegation to congress that's why right after you reelect president donald trump for four more years and right after you send john james to the united states senate we need to send congressman john molinar and eric asaki to a new republican majority in the house of representatives that retires nancy pelosi once and for all i mean when you look at all that we accomplished in those first three years there's only one way you can describe it we made america great again and then i don't have to tell anyone here or any american then the coronavirus struck from china but before the first documented case of community spread anywhere in this country president donald trump did what no american president had ever done he suspended all travel from china the second largest economy in the world now now joe biden said that was xenophobic he said it was hysterical he actually wrote in january that suspending travel from any country would quote make things worse but i can tell you having led the white house coronavirus task force over the last eight months president trump's actions suspending all travel from china saved untold american lives and bought us invaluable time to stand up the largest national mobilization since world war ii we reinvented testing we searched billions of medical supplies to our incredible doctors and nurses all across michigan and all across america we develop new therapeutics that are literally saving lives as we speak and before the end of this year we're going to have tens of millions of doses of a safe and effective coronavirus vaccine for the american people that's what leadership looks like that's the leadership of president donald trump so we're going to keep providing michigan everything that you need and can we just take a moment you know i got uh i got eric asaki here who's been a a career in health care can we just show our appreciation for the nurses for the doctors for the first responders and everyone that's been there for our families throughout this pandemic they are heroes all thank you we're going to keep making sure that our health care providers have all the support they need to give anyone impacted by the coronavirus the level of health care that we would want a family member of ours to have we'll keep all of us doing our part we'll keep slowing the spread we'll keep protecting the vulnerable we'll keep saving lives and where joe biden is talking about shutting down the economy we're opening up america again you know it's amazing to think in just the last five months after america lost 22 million jobs at the height of this pandemic with that strong foundation that we poured together in those first three years of a strong economy and with the unprecedented support that congress molinar and others provided to families and businesses in the midst of this pandemic we've already seen 11 and a half million people go back to work including 600 000 people right here in michigan we are opening up america again and we are opening up america's schools we just announced we were sending 100 million 15-minute tests to all the school nurses around america i'm going to make sure that we can get our kids back in the classroom where they belong and keep them there safe and sound and we're not just opening up our schools in the classroom thanks to president donald trump big ten footballers back michigan state's going to be back on the gridiron and the wolverines will be back on the field at the big house come this saturday get ready you know men and women it really is great to be with you today and i appreciate you all coming out but i expect you're here because you all know not only the choice in this election has never been clear but the stakes have never been higher i mean you stood in the rain and you trudged through that muddy field not to see not to see your vice president you did it because you love michigan and you love america i mean the truth is when you look at their agenda of higher taxes open borders socialized medicine a green new deal defunding the police packing the courts it's clear joe biden would be nothing more than a trojan horse for the radical left now joe biden says that democracy's on the ballot well i think our economic recovery is on the bound i think law and order are on the ballot but i also believe there are things much more foundational to our country much more fundamental to who we are as a nation you know in this election i think when it's all said and done it's not going to be whether america is more conservative or more liberal whether america is more republican or more democrat more red or more blue i think the choice in this election is whether america remains america whether we're going to chart a course build on the highest ideals of this nation of freedom patriotism liberty justice for all or whether we are going to let joe biden kamala harris and the radical left take our nation on a path of socialism and american decline so for our freedom for all the ideals that have always made america great we need to decide right here and right now that joe biden will never be president of the united states we're going to re-elect president donald trump for four more years it's on michigan you know as the president said we got work to do because for all that we accomplished in those first three years for all this president has done to see our nation through this global pandemic that's just what president trump calls a good start right i mean we're just getting started and over the next four years we're going to distribute that vaccine and we're going to defeat the virus we're going to maintain america's unrivaled military might and ensure peace through american strength we're going to make america into the manufacturing superpower of the world and end reliance on china once and for all we're going to uphold religious liberty the freedom of speech the right to keep and bear arms we're going to hire more police we're going to ban sanctuary cities and we're going to stop the indoctrination of our kids and restore patriotic education to america's schools as the president said at mount rushmore we're going to teach our children to love our country honor our history and always respect our great american flag you know men and women i have to tell you i didn't know the president that well before he picked up the phone and called me and asked me to join this ticket but i said yes in a heartbeat because i saw what the people of michigan saw i saw the vision grounded in the highest american ideals i saw the leadership qualities and the determination that could make this country great again i'll never forget the night that he called we'd been tipped off that among a group of americans he was considering as running mates that we were going to get the phone call we'd prayed all the way through it my wife was standing right next to me phone rang i picked up the phone i heard that familiar voice and he said mike it's going to be great and you know what he was right it has been great every single day and we're gonna make it greater still for four more years yes but you know we've uh we've served shoulder to shoulder these last four years and i some people think we're a little bit different but actually we've gotten to be very close friends and i want to tell you i've been there when the cameras are off and the klig lights are off i've been there every day at his side and i promise you i promise you there has never been a day gone by against overwhelming opposition by the democrats and their allies in the national media there's never been a day gone by that president trump hasn't gotten up and fought to keep the promises that he made to the people of michigan now it's our turn to fight for him so i got a couple things i got to ask you to do before i uh head over to indiana i guess you go going back to the hoosier state today because i'm going to do what i'm first going to ask you to do first thing i need you to do karen and i are going to do tomorrow morning vote michigan vote to re-elect president donald trump i mean i heard early voting's already started here in michigan so maybe after we're done here it's only about one o'clock you'd go down to the waterford township clerk's office 5200 civic center drive here in waterford they're open eight to five go and vote for president donald trump and remember friends don't let friends vote alone bring a family member bring a co-worker and vote to reelect this president for four more years and secondly after you vote with a friend i want you to spend every remaining moment of the next 12 days telling people why you walked through that muddy field to get here really tell them what tell them all that we accomplished in those first three years to make america stronger and more prosperous to strengthen the constitutional foundation of our liberties in this nation to stand with law and order you go tell them all that we accomplished and tell them about the choice that we face and so you know i was out at the airport the other day standing in the rain mike showed up and he just like talked for like a whole hour just about everything that we've accomplished and what we can do with four more years i really do believe that when michigan made history in 2016 it was because people were talking to each other i mean you remember all the pundits all the polls were writing us off back then right but the people of michigan knew different you knew we could be strong again and prosperous again and you talk to your neighbors and friends at worship and at work and you need to do it again i'll never forget that election night we were at the campaign headquarters in new york city and i was standing right here and the president was standing next to me and my wife and our kids were here and the whole trump family was there we're looking up at these big tv screens on the wall you know every time a state had come in he'd like punch me in the shoulder he'd say south carolina's in boom see did you see that i said yeah yeah said indiana came in boom right good all right but i'm telling you what when michigan came through i thought he was going to knock me on the ground so you got to do what you did before go tell the story all across michigan why we need four more years of president donald trump in the white house i want to feel that again i know we will if we all do what we need to do so remember from here vote with a friend tell somebody every every day between now and election and finally you know as i've traveled across this country the last four years i've come to two great conclusions that i believe more now than i've ever believed in my life everywhere i've gone i'm more convinced than ever america is a freedom-loving nation and america is a nation of faith you know as we travel across this land the sweetest words the president and i ever hear when someone will say i'm praying for you and we hear it a lot and so i would just say if you're if you're of a mind to bend the knee or bow the head from time to time now would be a good time to do it and over the next 12 days i'd encourage you to pray with confidence claim those ancient words that americans have clung to through much more challenging times than we could possibly imagine the americans who uh who cleared the forest that settled this state the americans who have fought the wars endured the great challenges in our nation those ancient words that if his people who are called by his name will humble themselves and pray and turn he'll do like he's always done in the long and storied history of this nation he'll hear from heaven and he'll heal this land this one nation under god indivisible with liberty and justice for all so pray for america pray for all of the american people it'll make a difference it'll make a difference and i leave here today with renewed confidence grateful for your support grateful for your attendance here today and more confident than ever that we are just 12 days away from a great victory all across michigan and all across america and i just know if all of us do all that we need to do between now and election day we're going to make michigan and america stronger and safer than ever before we're going to make michigan and america more prosperous than you could possibly imagine we're going to make michigan and america more united than ever before and with john james in the united states senate with congressman john molinar and eric asaki in a new republican majority in the house with president donald trump in the white house for four more years and with god's help we will make america great

PRON what PRON be go to be a great night and a couple week ago PRON have a little debate out in salt lake city thank PRON some people think PRON do all right but i get to tell PRON PRON be a great privilege for PRON to be able to be there to talk about all this president have do with the support of all of PRON good people here in michigan i mean think about PRON four year ago PRON inherit a military that have be hollow out by devastate budget cut an economy that be struggle to break out of the slow economic recovery since the great depression terrorism be on the rise around the world and PRON witness a steady assault on PRON most cherished value but in three short year PRON rebuild PRON military PRON revive PRON economy PRON secure PRON border support law enforcement stand for life and liberty and the constitution of the united states and PRON know PRON all start with PRON national defense after year of reckless budget cut that hollow out PRON military truth be tell when PRON take office when PRON take office there be a percentage of aircraft in the united states air force that be keep on the ground to be use as spare part to keep other aircraft in the air i mean the truth be that all change when president donald trump walk into the oval office president trump sign the large investment in PRON national defense since the day of ronald reagan and i can attest as PRON vice president and as the proud father of a united states marine pilot PRON be finally give PRON soldier sailor airmen marines and coast guard the resource and support PRON need to defend this nation PRON know and PRON be not just be about stand with those who serve in uniform but PRON have also stand with all of PRON who have serve in the uniform of the united states in fact if PRON be a veteran of PRON armed force would PRON just mind raise PRON hand in the air and give PRON a chance to say thank PRON one more time thank PRON for PRON service thank PRON for PRON service when joe biden be vice president PRON all remember PRON see year of scandal at the va that shock the conscience of the nation remember that i mean PRON literally have veteran that be die wait to get health care at va

now available for every veteran in america support for PRON troop and PRON family support for PRON veteran PRON be just one more reason why PRON need four more year of president donald trump in the white house and why PRON need michigan to send an army combat veteran to washington d c PRON need john james in the united states senate so PRON be about provide for PRON national defense but in PRON first three year after joe biden have spend the last the previous eight year try to tax and spend and regulate PRON back to a grow economy president donald trump create the great economy in american history and now in the midst of a global pandemic joe biden want to raise taxis by trillion dollar president trump PRON cut taxis across the board for work family and business large and small PRON roll back more federal red tape than any administration in history PRON fight for free and fair trade PRON unleash american energy and in just three short year business large and small create seven million good pay job include a hundred and twelve thousand job right here in the wolverine state amazing in PRON first three year unemployment reach a year low across america PRON be the low unemployment for year in the state of michigan and wage be rise across the board and what mean the most of the president be PRON be wage be rise most rapidly for hard work blue collar americans the forget man and woman of america be forget no more and i do not know if PRON hear about PRON but just this morning PRON be announce that weekly jobless claim just hit PRON low level since march michigan be back america come back and motor city be back PRON know PRON really be great to be in pontiac i think this may be PRON first visit here and in waterford PRON be not far from pontiac right PRON be just as get mention great legacy and tradition PRON first car be a pontiac thought that may do PRON some good PRON be PRON use to flip over the air filter in that thing do PRON do that when PRON be young yeah i have a four barrel in PRON man that thing that thing would haul and PRON would make a lot of noise when PRON flip that air filter PRON will tell PRON let PRON just hear PRON for the great tradition of craftsmanship in waterford and pontiac what a great history and under president trump leadership PRON be proud to report to the automotive industry be roar back all across the state of michigan last year general motors announce PRON be add about job fiat chrysler already be build a billion dollar plant and PRON commit to job in the motor city right here in michigan and PRON be be because of those policy less taxis less regulation but PRON be also be because PRON have a president who be be fight for free and fair trade that put american job and american worker first i mean when PRON come to international trade PRON be amazing to think when PRON take office half of PRON international trade deficit be with communist china billion dollar a year PRON be lose to china in PRON trading relationship and joe biden PRON be be a cheerleader for communist china all along the way PRON actually say the rise of china be a positive development and PRON dismiss last year the idea that china be even a competitor but under president donald trump PRON make PRON clear from day one when PRON come to china the era of economic surrender be over PRON impose tariff and PRON be go to stand strong until china open PRON market to what PRON make and what PRON grow once and for all and close to home when PRON come to nafta i do not have to tell the people of michigan what this hoosier also know about nafta i mean in the year since nafta be sign PRON have factory that close all across america PRON do many of those job move south of the border and many move overseas now democrats for year use to talk about how bad nafta be but joe biden never lift a finger to renegotiate PRON or reform PRON but under the man who write the art of the deal america get a well deal nafta be go and the usmc be here to stay and PRON be a win for michigan and a win for america i do not know if PRON know PRON but under the usmca percent of auto part and duty free car have to be make in north america and percent of PRON have to be make by worker make the average hourly wage that worker make in the united states of america now the people of michigan deserve to know not only that joe biden never lift a finger to reform nafta but when PRON come time to replace PRON with the usmca PRON run mate kamala harris be one of only senator to vote against the usmca in the senate PRON say the usmca do not go far enough on climate change kamala harris put PRON radical environmental agenda ahead of michigan auto workers and michigan auto job PRON be one more reason why michigan need to say no to joe and yes to four more year of president donald trump and the white house and when PRON come to energy so important in a manufacturing state like michigan and all across this country joe biden and the radical left want to crush american energy under a two trillion dollar version of the green new deal remember in the last presidential debate president trump have to remind PRON that PRON support the green new deal may have to remind PRON again tonight i mean PRON two trillion dollar version of the green new deal would raise the cost of electricity for every home and business in michigan PRON be true i mean PRON be talk about require four million business to be essentially retrofit two million home to be retrofit to live up to joe biden kamala harris and aoc green new deal president trump PRON be be a champion of american energy and american energy independence PRON end the war on coal and today america be a net exporter of energy for the first time in year incredible PRON know when joe biden be vice president america actually lose manufacturing job and the last president who i see be out on the campaign trail yesterday PRON say those job be never come back do PRON remember i mean PRON refer to PRON part of the country as the rust belt and there be a lot of rust on the belt when PRON be in charge remember after president obama say that those job be never come back PRON say quote what magic wand do PRON have well PRON do not need a magic wand PRON just need president donald trump in the white house manufacture job in just three year include job right here in the state of michigan manufacturing be back and when PRON come to health care even on health care PRON all remember PRON plan remember obamacare all the promise that PRON make the last administration joe biden vice president PRON say if PRON like PRON doctor PRON can keep PRON be not true PRON say if PRON like PRON health insurance PRON can keep PRON be not true PRON say health insurance premium would go down when PRON take office health insurance premium have double under obamacare and joe biden have a plan to literally take the socialize medicine option of bernie sander and put PRON right in the middle of obamacare PRON would send PRON on an inevitable path to socialized medicine here in michigan and all across america president donald trump PRON get rid of the individual mandate PRON have be fight to lower the cost of health insurance without grow the size of government PRON have lower the cost of prescription drug medicare advantage premium drop by in this

PRON friend in every day between now and election day who do PRON really think can bring this economy all the way back and then some a career politician who spend year in washington raise taxis stifle PRON economy under an avalanche of regulation and economic surrender or a prove job creator who will keep cut taxis roll back red tape and fight for american job and american worker for PRON family

PRON be go to send john james to a large republican majority in the united states senate PRON be go to stand for the rule of law and an independent judiciary i promise PRON that amen and every day since this president take office PRON be proud to say that PRON have stand without apology for the man and woman who serve on the thin blue line of law enforcement and PRON always will PRON know the president i know what PRON know man and woman who serve in law enforcement be some of the good people in this country PRON be people that literally get up every day and count PRON life be more important than PRON own and those who serve in law enforcement deserve the respect of every american every day in fact PRON kind of come with uh come with the job description PRON get a lot of law enforcement people around PRON would PRON mind just show PRON how much PRON appreciate all the law enforcement people that be here today can PRON just say thank PRON to PRON and PRON family for all PRON do for PRON every day as PRON protect and serve thank PRON all very much PRON know president trump and i will always support the right of americans to peaceful protest but rioting and looting be not peaceful protest burn business be not free speech now all summer long all joe biden ever talk about be peaceful protester remember as the american people literally watch business and community burn to the ground the truth be joe biden would double down on the policy that have lead to violence in america cities i mean when PRON start to withdraw support from those who protect and serve PRON only embolden those who would do harm to PRON family in PRON community now joe biden justify PRON all by say that in PRON word america be systemically racist and PRON and kamala harris often say that police officer in this country have a quote implicit bias against minority when joe blind be ask if PRON would support cut funding for law enforcement PRON say yes absolutely and kamala harris recently praise the mayor of los angeles for cut million dollar out of the budget of the lapd well let PRON make PRON a promise with four more year of president donald trump in the white house PRON be not go to defund the police not now not ever PRON be go to back the blue every single day i mean PRON all know PRON do not have to choose between support law enforcement and support PRON african american neighbor and friend and minority family and all the family in PRON city PRON have do both for the last three and a half year and PRON be go to keep do both for four more year under this president PRON invest with the strong support of people like john molinar PRON support funding in the cop program that allow for the hiring of four thousand additional police officer when violence break out in PRON city PRON launch operation legend in city across the country PRON work with state and local law enforcement PRON have already arrest more than three thousand violent offender in PRON city restore peace to PRON street and at the same time PRON have be support law enforcement i could not be more proud to be vice president to a president that see the low unemployment ever record for african americans the high funding for historically black college and university in history PRON create opportunity zone in PRON major city past criminal justice reform and PRON have fight to give educational choice to every family in america this president have prove PRON can stand with law enforcement stand with PRON minority family and i promise PRON PRON be go to keep do that and PRON be go to have law and order in every city in every state in this nation for every american of every race and creed and color so help PRON god so PRON have stand for the rule of law stand strong with law enforcement PRON have also stand by PRON most cherish liberty PRON know when joe biden be vice president PRON see a steady assault on the freedom of religion the american people one administrative act after another the last administration actually haul a group of catholic nun into federal court to force PRON to compromise PRON faith to live under the mandate of obamacare president donald trump PRON restore the conscience right of doctor and nurse and religious charity and president trump end the assault on the little sister of the poor once and for all and beyond PRON value and PRON faith i could not be more proud to be vice president to a president who have stand without apology for the sanctity of human life where joe biden and kamala harris support taxpayer funding of abortion all the way up to the moment of birth president trump reinstate the mexico city policy that deny federal dollar to any program that promote abortion around the world and PRON sign a bill that give state the right to defund planned parenthood president donald trump be the most pro life president in american history and PRON be go to stand for the right to life for four more year so in PRON first three year think about the progress PRON make with the strong support of PRON ally in congress PRON rebuild PRON military revive PRON economy stand for law and order liberty in life but i want to say from PRON heart none of that would have be possible without the strong and consistent support of michigan republican delegation to congress that be why right after PRON reelect president donald trump for four more year and right after PRON send john james to the united states senate PRON need to send congressman john molinar and eric asaki to a new republican majority in the house of representative that retire nancy pelosi once and for all i mean when PRON look at all that PRON accomplish in those first three year there be only one way PRON can describe PRON PRON make america great again and then i do not have to tell anyone here or any american then the coronavirus strike from china but before the first document case of community spread anywhere in this country president donald trump do what no american president have ever do PRON suspend all travel from china the second large economy in the world now now joe biden say that be xenophobic PRON say PRON be hysterical PRON actually write in january that suspend travel from any country would quote make thing bad but i can tell PRON have lead the white house coronavirus task force over the last eight month president trump action suspend all travel from china save untold american life and buy PRON invaluable time to stand up the large national mobilization since world war ii PRON reinvent test PRON search billion of medical supply to PRON incredible doctor and nurse all across michigan and all across america PRON develop new therapeutic that be literally save life as PRON speak and before the end of this year PRON be go to have ten of million of dose of a safe and effective coronavirus vaccine for the american people that be what leadership look like that be the leadership of president donald trump so PRON be go to keep provide michigan everything that PRON need and can PRON just take a moment PRON know i get uh i get eric asaki here who be be a a career in health care can PRON just show PRON appreciation for the nurse for the doctor for the first responder and everyone that be be there for PRON family throughout this pandemic PRON be hero all thank PRON PRON be go to keep make sure that PRON health care provider have all the support PRON need to give anyone impact by the coronavirus the level of health care that PRON would want a family member of ours to have PRON will keep all of PRON do PRON part PRON will keep slow the spread PRON will keep protect the vulnerable PRON will keep save life and where joe biden be talk about shut down the economy PRON be open up america again PRON know PRON be amazing to think in just the last five month after america lose million job at the height of this pandemic with that strong foundation that PRON pour together in those first three year of a strong economy and with the unprecedented support that congress molinar and other provide to family and business in the midst of this pandemic PRON have already see and a half million people go back to work include people right here in michigan PRON be open up america again and PRON be open up america school PRON just announce PRON be send million minute test to all the school nurse around america PRON be go to make sure that PRON can get PRON kid back in the classroom where PRON belong and keep PRON there safe and sound and PRON be not just open up PRON school in the classroom thank to president donald trump big ten footballer back michigan state be go to be back on the gridiron and the wolverine will be back on the field at the big house come this saturday get ready PRON know man and woman PRON really be great to be with PRON today and i appreciate PRON all come out but i expect PRON be here because PRON all know not only the choice in this election have never be clear but the stake have never be high i mean PRON stand in the rain and PRON trudge through that muddy field not to see not to see PRON vice president PRON do PRON because PRON love michigan and PRON love america i mean the truth be when PRON look at PRON agenda of high taxis open border socialize medicine a green new deal defunde the police pack the court PRON be clear joe biden would be nothing more than a trojan horse for the radical left now joe biden say that democracy be on the ballot well i think PRON economic recovery be on the bind i think law and order be on the ballot but i also believe there be thing much more foundational to PRON country much more fundamental to who PRON be as a nation PRON know in this election i think when PRON be all say and do PRON be not go to be whether america be more conservative or more liberal whether america be more republican or more democrat more red or more blue i think the choice in this election be whether america remain america whether PRON be go to chart a course build on the high ideal of this nation of freedom patriotism liberty justice for all or whether PRON be go to let joe biden kamala harris and the radical left take PRON nation on a path of socialism and american decline so for PRON freedom for all the ideal that have always make america great PRON need to decide right here and right now that joe biden will never be president of the united states PRON be go to re elect president donald trump for four more year PRON be on michigan PRON know as the president say PRON get work to do because for all that PRON accomplish in those first three year for all this president have do to see PRON nation through this global pandemic that be just what president trump call a good start right i mean PRON be just get start and over the next four year PRON be go to distribute that vaccine and PRON be go to defeat the virus PRON be go to maintain america unrivaled military may and ensure peace through american strength PRON be go to make america into the manufacturing superpower of the world and end reliance on china once and for all PRON be go to uphold religious liberty the freedom of speech the right to keep and bear arm PRON be go to hire more police PRON be go to ban sanctuary city and PRON be go to stop the indoctrination of PRON kid and restore patriotic education to america school as the president say at mount rushmore PRON be go to teach PRON child to love PRON country honor PRON history and always respect PRON great american flag PRON know man and woman i have to tell PRON i do not know the president that well before PRON pick up the phone and call PRON and ask PRON to join this ticket but i say yes in a heartbeat because i see what the people of michigan see i see the vision ground in the high american ideal i see the leadership quality and the determination that could make this country great again PRON will never forget the night that PRON call PRON would be tip off that among a group of americans PRON be consider as run mate that PRON be go to get the phone call PRON would pray all the way through PRON PRON wife be stand right next to PRON phone rang i pick up the phone i hear that familiar voice and PRON say mike PRON be go to be great and PRON know what PRON be right PRON have be great every single day and PRON be go to make PRON great still for four more year yes but PRON know PRON have uh PRON have serve shoulder to shoulder these last four year and i some people think PRON be a little bit different but actually PRON have get to be very close friend and i want to tell PRON PRON have be there when the camera be off and the klig light be off PRON have be there every day at PRON side and i promise PRON i promise PRON there have never be a day go by against overwhelming opposition by the democrats and PRON ally in the national medium there be never be a day go by that president trump have not get up and fight to keep the promise that PRON make to the people of michigan now PRON be PRON turn to fight for PRON so i get a couple thing i get to ask PRON to do before i uh head over to indiana i guess PRON go go back to the hoosi state today because PRON be go to do what PRON be first go to ask PRON to do first thing i need PRON to do karen and i be go to do tomorrow morning vote michigan vote to re elect president donald trump i mean i hear

not bad you remember how this all happened sleepy joe said president trump didn't want to have football i said what the hell is he talking about sleepy joe so i said what's the problem with football they said big ten football is shut down i said well he said i did it yeah he blamed me i said i had nothing to do with it so then i said i got an idea i'm going to get it open if it's shut down right that's what happened i think even took an ad president trump shut down football i didn't think about it i must tell you i'm thinking about china and i'm thinking about a lot of other things so i i said uh you know what we'll do we'll teach sleepy joe in that group that don't have what it takes we'll teach him how to do it and i worked hard to bring back big ten and i got together with your commissioner you did a good job and we got it back and today you won your football game and we're very happy about it because i know that life in ohio is not complete without the glory of ohio state football and other football right i'm glad you won the game i wouldn't have wanted to come can you imagine if you lost the game and you know there's a lot of people in here but did you see outside you're very lucky to be here say thank you very much for this wonderful journey president no you have to see you have to see there are tens of thousands of people in the streets out here trying to get in i think the next time the next time we'll get a larger field thank you very much thank you very much yeah that's it that's really nice thank you thank you very much i appreciate it and by the way we got pac 12 back i don't you don't care about pac-12 but we got packed with we said we might as well do out there too right and we did a doubleheader ten days from now we're going to win this great state and we are going to win four more years in the white house remember last time about the state remember they said for a year i had to hear it you cannot win unless you win the great state of ohio i heard it so many times that was these fake people look at all of them over the camera look at all those cameras look at all those lights that are on all those lights that are on but you remember that they would drum it for a year i heard you cannot win unless you win ohio and then i got a poll and i said we're doing pretty well in ohio by the way right and then we won remember they said it's going to be close it's going to be hard to win going to be very very hard and trump if he doesn't win ohio he's out and then we not only won ohio we won ohio by more than eight points eight points and they said and they said you know the story when it uh when it closes i mean they do a fast little count if you're winning big they said the polls in ohio have closed donald trump has won the state of ohio it's like immediate it was like in the same sentence the polls have closed trump is one you know normally it would take like hours and whatever if it's close no we won big and i hear we're winning big now and i'm hearing they gave up with the state already and you know they're going to give up on florida very soon because we're winning big in florida we're winning big in north carolina you don't want sleepy joe to be your president you know he draws flies he's not drawing anybody and obama was there they called in obama they said sir sir this is a few days ago sir i bet just what president obama is going to campaign for sleepy joe and i said is that good news or bad news that's true and he said well he's going to campaign so i guess it started yesterday the day before right they had 42 people show 42 we have thousands tens of thousands and outside is five times what this no there's something going on this happened last time four years ago this time more at this time more it happened last time there was an enthusiasm four years ago the likes of which the fake news has never seen before right and i'll have to tell you and maybe i'll be wrong but at least to this point the enthusiasm is much more because you know what we've all done together we've done a lot we've done it we've done a lot it's much more it's much more we got all those tax cuts we got all the regulation cuts we got the steel guys back we put tariffs on all the crap that they were dumping from china 25 they were dumping the steel and we said you can't do that and lots of other things we've done a lot but it's far greater today look at this field i mean as far as i can see it's far greater today than it was four years ago and this is the most important election this is the most important election of your lifetimes i see a lot of young people up here so big deal like what 12 years no big deal right it's really the most it could be the most important election we've ever had i really believe that too and i didn't think i'd be saying it because our last win was such a big win we've done so much nobody's done more than what we've done they don't even question it you know when i say it because they like to always oh he did this he said that he said you know they don't even question we have done more in the first three and a half years than any administration has done when you look at everything and it's an honor but this is the most important election i didn't think i would say it because i i viewed the last uh what we did four years ago can you believe four years ago almost can you imagine that the time flies i'll never forget the first night in the white house i said it's like a surreal experience i have abraham lincoln's bedroom here i was talking to the first lady they said do you believe this took a little while it takes a while to get used to it and then you know what you have to do you have to get down to work you get down to work and that's what we did at the debate this week did anybody see the debate maybe [Applause] a couple people they had a lot that was like a super bowl deal i guess uh with the ratings that's okay that we had one called 91 to nine it was 91 with with us having the 91 okay yeah i kept saying hey joe joe you want to do all this stuff why didn't you do it you were there three and a half years ago do it why didn't you do it joe you didn't do much joe then i said i wouldn't have run joe i wouldn't have run if you did a good job if you two did a good job i wouldn't have run i didn't need this joe i had a very good life joe i didn't need this joe i had a good life i had a very nice life joe but i wouldn't have run you did a good job i wouldn't have run and if i did i wouldn't have won because you would have done a good job there would have been no reason the fact is you didn't do a good job joe you let us down joe and he had no idea what i was talking about here no clue but after debate this week the american people saw the contrast between a 47-year career politician who used his public office to enrich himself you know that i mean his son was like his son was like a human vacuum cleaner just follow his let's go to china this week dad okay son hello take out a billion and a half you get all the fees in a billion and a half how about going to ukraine now they'll pay me 183 000 a month for my for my great great services on energy what do you know about energy son i didn't know i don't know anything dead but i'll learn i'm willing to learn for the last half century joe biden has been outsourcing your jobs opening your borders and sacrificing american blood and treasure in these endless ridiculous foreign wars countries you've never even heard of for the most part i fight for the middle class i fight for everyone i fight for this country [Applause] and biden doesn't know who he's fighting for now you have to say you know this is serious stuff it is it is serious stuff but is there any place better to be than a trump rally mean seriously right i mean it's serious but we have fun and you know the best way to succeed you got to love what you're doing and we all love it and we love our country we love our country in 2016 ohio voted to fire this depraved political establishment and you elected an outsider as your president who is finally putting america first that's what i'm doing you work hard you raise your families you follow our laws you support your church that you're not even allowed to go to how about that you can't go to your church but you can have a riot down fifth avenue isn't that you serve your community and you give your love and loyalty to our great country now you finally have a president that is loyal to you totally honestly believe me there are easier ways to spend my life this was nobody told me the swamp was going to be that deep and that vicious they even impeached me over a perfect phone call hello how you doing congratulations congratulations on your win mr president of ukraine we're going to impeach him these people are crazy these people oh now they're doing it again you know the laptop from hell they found the laptop from this is a laptop that they don't want to see how the hell this laptop got freed up it's amazing the way god works the laptop right and now it comes it's adam shifty schiff yesterday i saw for the first time watermelon he's shaped like a watermelon adam schiff dishonest guy totally dishonest guy made up my conversation remember the halls of congress said quid pro quo eight times i didn't say it at all isn't it lucky i had a transcriber isn't it lucky otherwise it would be my word against shifty shift but think of it think of it so adam schiff he's out there and he's talking about what's taken place and here it is the laptop from hell he said it's russia russia here we go again russia russia russia i think russia must look at us they say these people are stone cold crazy this is this is russian disinformation i'll tell you what we got to get back to business this is crazy what's going on this is crazy russia i heard it yesterday they got him caught i think didn't he say that the baby said well this was russia disinformation this is a disaster for them but let's see what happens but see but we have learned a lot we've learned how corrupt the media is i already knew they were corrupt but but they don't want to write anything about it so listen so we caught them cold just like we caught them spying on my campaign we caught them doing horrible treasonous things these were treasonous things let's see what happens should have gone much faster i have to be honest with you but we caught him spying in our campaign the whole group and by the way obama and biden they knew everything about it they knew everything about it we caught him with that too it's much better if i say no no no please no it's terrible it's a terrible thing now they're trying to do it again where they get caught and they're trying to say it with russia they never say china you know why a lot of money comes out of china into their pockets and did you ever notice china has not been very good we did a great trade deal unbelievable uh two weeks ago the largest order of corn the largest order of soybeans the largest yeah yeah except except i feel different normally i would have been here talking about the great trade but you know what the ink on the trade deal wasn't dry and then all of a sudden the plague came in from china that's more important than trade deals that's more important so it's no good with your vote we will continue to bring back your jobs lower drug prices at a level that nobody's ever lowered them before and you last year for the first time ever drug prices went down but we're doing what's called the favorite nations laws the drug companies are not happy with me this is not supposed to have happened favored nations means you'll pay the lowest price anywhere in the world you match its favorite nations and nobody's exercised it because nobody thought of it probably but if they did think of it they couldn't have done it because the drug companies are so powerful they are taking you see all the ads against me it's not so much sleepy joe it's the drug companies because i've exercised a favored nation so if germany or another country pays 10 cents for a pill the exact pill and we pay two and a half dollars and you're talking about stuff like that these are the kind of differences we pay for all research and development everything so if germany's at 10 or somebody and we're at much higher we now pay 10. it's very simple it's called favorite nations we pay the lowest in the world your prices could come down 50 60 70 80 they'll come down a lot and uh i have never had more ads spent because they have unlimited money so big pharma they call it right so number one power in washington and i've just learned they're the number one power and i knew this was going to happen i said i don't care i'm put here to do a job i'm put here to do a job they have the middlemen you know they have the drug pricing is very complicated it's very complicated stuff they have it set so that it's almost impossible to disengage it and they have middlemen you know the middlemen nobody ever heard they never say middle women i've never heard middle women i want to be nice i want to say middle women but i've never heard the term having to do with drug prices but they have the middlemen gets millions gets more than the drug companies at least the drug companies make the drugs right these people don't do anything they're very rich i probably know some of them i would be not surprised if hunter biden was also a middleman he probably got on top of everything else takes in millions and millions now we find out that hunter biden is a middlemen but these are rich people and they get all this money for nothing so i worked a deal where canada which buys their drugs for exactly 50 i'm going to let our governors your governor governor florida other governors buy buy their drugs directly from canada nobody's ever done same drug exactly the same same lab same company same everything and they're going to buy it for 50 percent less and then by that time the favored nations will kick in and you'll get it for even less so this has never happened before but it's happening we will support our great police protect your second amendment defend your borders and ensure more products are proudly stamped with that beautiful isn't it a beautiful phrase get in here for a long time until trump came along made in the usa made in the usa you didn't hear it for a long time right in a long time you know when i was young that you said made in america made you every car made in them now you don't see it anymore we're going to see it remember i was saying today i was in north carolina speaking to a great crowd and i said remember i when i first started i said we're going to say merry christmas again remember and you remember all the department stores many of them are wiped out because of the internet but these are minor details right but all the department stores they'd say happy new year and everything but christmas they don't want to say christmas i said we're going to say christmas again and you know what they're all saying christmas again they're saying merry christmas [Applause] they're all saying merry christmas again gonna be there pretty soon and we have a big day you better get out november 3rd big big big who's voted already who's voting i just voted i just voted get out and vote no this is the biggest election that i really believe maybe we've ever had because the radical left has gone crazy and you know what when we win this one i think they're going to rest i really do i think they're going to say okay that's enough that's enough she goes no they won't you're probably right but you know what brings it together success and we're doing a super v we're going up you see housing starts and the numbers the automobile starts nobody's ever seen anything like it the numbers for some things are better than they were pre this plague that came in the pandemic i mean it's amazing actually amazing we have a super v you're going to see a number that's going to be announced just prior to the election gdp it was just estimated by the fed to be 35 i think the highest we've ever had was like seven now who knows if they're right maybe they're i'll take 25 right now okay problem is i mentioned 35 so if it's 25 you know what they'll do it was a terrible terrible upset for the president whatever if it was 15 i'd be happy they just estimated they think it might be 35 that's unheard of we're coming back because we built you know why though because we built a strong foundation we had a strong foundation if we didn't this country would be some mess and if a guy like biden gets in where he wants to raise your taxes quadruple and he wants to put all those ridiculous regulations that used to take 20 years to get approval for a highway now we got it down to two years and i'm trying to get it down to one i think we can and it might not get built for safety reasons or environmental reasons but we have it down to a very very short period of time it used to take i mean we have roads 21 22 years and then it would get disapproved they would then raise their hands not to approve it after 20 years now you know those days are over but he would put everything back and he's going to raise he's going to raise your taxes like crazy i've never seen anyone you know all my life i've been involved indirectly usually on the other side only exclusively i've never seen raising taxes i've seen politicians we will lower your tax this is the first politician that's ever running saying he's going to quadruple your taxes what the heck this is a cree this is the craziest thing i've ever seen i mean it's i'm looking up i'm saying is this really like is this serious first of all i look at him i say is am i running against this man i'm running against i'm running against sleepy joe in prime time he wasn't good now i'm running against him this is not prime time did you think he did well in the debate the other night the last question was the best though right because he lied about fracking he kept lying he kept going during the primaries there will be no fracking there will be no fracking by the way you're a big fracking state you better hope that either you've only got about a million you've only got about a million jobs more importantly than the jobs is you get the lowest energy prices we've had how about your two dollar gasoline unless what you wouldn't mind if it went to nine ten dollars twelve dollars you couldn't get it well they wouldn't mind because they'd like you to get rid of all your cars no more airplanes no more cars no more cows you don't count i think they took that off the manifesto right it was too much but they would like it they would like it no what we're doing has been incredible you can't have your tax increase so i'm cutting taxes we're doing another big tax cut that's what brought everything in [Applause] billions and billions of dollars has come into our country because of what we've done what you're going to do is chase it all out because i mean they're you know these are people without a lot of heart they go where they make the deal we brought it down we brought the middle income taxes down child tax credit a thousand dollars a child he said he wants to get rid of it okay he wants to get rid of it why does he want to get rid of it he [Applause] that could only take place in the great state of ohio you know i worked here for a couple of summers in cincinnati i like i like cincinnati i like ohio [Applause] worked out well it was a good success and you know it's like uh when something works out well you like it that was i was very young a job in cincinnati swifton village did anybody ever hear swift in swiftly anyway and we bought it and we sold it and it worked out nice and you know you always have like a good feeling but i have an even better feeling because of what happened four years ago with ohio even better feel and it's gonna happen again but it's the first time i've ever seen a politician say we will raise your taxes i'm saying wait a minute let's get it did he say no seriously have you ever heard a politician campaigning or i'm going to raise your taxes and i'm going to put a lot more regulations but a lot of people don't know you know i think the regulation cuts we did was actually more important maybe not for everybody but for the business people and then they hire in jobs all over the place you know we had 160 million people working we've never been anywhere close to that number we're going to be back very soon 11.4 million people hired over the last year mark which was a record but i think the regulation cuts might have been even more important this election is a choice between a trump super recovery and a biden in my opinion this is going to happen i hate to say it depression you're going to have a depression and your 401ks does anybody have a 401k throw them away they're not going to be worth it it's a choice between a boom and a lockdown did you hear him during the debate right he said i'd lock it down oh yes i don't know we're not locking it down no no we're not lying we've learned the disease we did the right thing we saved millions of lives we saved two million lives maybe more than that we locked it then we opened but we understand it like young people baron he had it the doctor said you know baron very very tall young man and a great guy right but he's young and the doctor said sir baron has tested positive i said that's terrible aaron didn't even know he was he said next day the doctor comes in sir baron's fine because they're young like these guys over here they're young because they have strong immune systems right they're strong they have these strong beautiful immune systems so it was good uh i happened to test right you know why i couldn't stay in a basement i'd meet a lot of people i'm president i have to get out i have to get out no it's true i'd have meetings where i'd go back and say you know that's got to be dangerous that's got to be this or that but the fact is i had it it worked out well now i'm immune i could run up and kiss this whole group of people men and women oh no it worked out by the way 99.9 is good and then you're immune and all that stuff you know i heard you were immune for life so when i had it i said i'm immune to them to the fake news and they said but only for four months i heard it was like with me it was for four months if it was anybody else it'd say for life it's true but anyway no i had it first lady had it right and you get better we got better they love the first ladies very elegant most elegant most elegant first lady now it's amazing it's amazing they uh they don't treat her very nicely and she's incredible the most elegant woman and she goes but that is okay she loves the people i mean it's really amazing we love her [Applause] yeah now she's done a great job and she loves it she loves the people but she had it recovered i had it recovered baron had it didn't even know he had it so it's uh it's one of those things but we have to lead your life so when i would be having meetings with gold star families military lots of other people i'd have meetings right and i'd go and i'd do the meeting and sometimes people would come up and they cut clothes and everything else mask no mask they get close and i'd leave somebody's meeting say that could be dangerous i guess i don't know you know but i have to do my job as i said at the debate i can't put myself in the basement of the white house for a year and a half i can't do it until this thing goes away and it is going away it's rounding the turn do you notice they talk about cases always cases cases cases they don't talk about mortality rate down 85 percent because what we have is so incredible the job we've done is so incredible 85 percent think of that 85 percent but they they do it and you know what november 4th you're not going to hear the news the cnn all they talk about covent covet covet covert if if a plane goes down with 500 people they don't talk about it all they talk because they're trying to scare everybody you have to lead your life and you have to get out you have to be vigilant be careful socially distance yeah get too close put the mask on put it on you know lots of different things but but really i see what they're doing it's so it's just like they try to hide all of this corruption from the biden family by not putting it they refuse to write it and i have to give the new york post my hometown paper the new york book the oldest newspaper in the country the fourth largest i have to give them credit because they went against the grain and they're willing to expose all of this corruption and then you see big tech they won't put it on and if you put it on they delete you they terminate you charlie kirk break up big tech well they did sue gargoyle nothing to do with this of course but they did sue google on thursday right you like it no terrible no no but they've exposed themselves because nobody knew it was that serious they won't put it on and if you put it on if you put something on from the new york i think they didn't they delete the new york post they terminated out the new york files right can you imagine a newspaper they won't put it on people have learned they don't want anything because if biden got in they would own the world if biden got in china would own our country i mean china did you see where the kid was trying to get 10 million dollars a year for introduction purposes okay this was down this is all down in the paper they say russia did it this is all down in a paper now confirmed by the guy that ran the company he's he's not uh i would say they're not too happy with him would you say i saw him the other day but it's all right stuff i mean what he's saying is right he couldn't take it anymore he couldn't stand the corruption so let's see but can you imagine when people say don't print it in other words you'll never hear but you know it ended up backfiring because that happened it's become a much bigger story because you add it all up it's actually become if they would have printed it who knows what would have happened you forget it something but it's become a much bigger big tech section 230 right big tech is corrupt it's corrupt the media the fake news is corrupt and i've been saying it for a long time even i didn't know that you were that corrupt but look at all them even i didn't know that you were that corrupt in the meantime [Music] in the meantime you watch the television sets go off let's cut cut this guy off cut the president can you imagine they're broadcasting this stuff and now they're saying cut them off but it's okay i don't mind because i like telling the truth biden and the democrats will offshore your jobs dismantle your police departments dissolve your borders confiscate your gun second amendment thereafter eliminate your private health care you know we have 180 million people with private health care a lot of you have private health care it's what you dream of it's great you negotiate you have many great companies doing it they compete you have great private health care they want to terminate it they want to terminate your religious liberty they want to destroy the suburbs i am the best thing that ever happened to the suburbs you know they were talking about this uh 60 minutes she asked me a question you saw that i put i printed out the whole interview i said put it down but she said to me the question one of her questions she said why are you begging why suburban women you said please love me suburban women please please love me please i i beg you please love me suburb no i didn't say that what i did is i said love me suburban women because i've saved the suburbs i've saved they had a regulation they had a regulation that would have brought low-income housing projects and crime right to their doorstep would have been right next to it and i said suburban women you're going to love me that's what i said and i was being psyched they said why are you begging for the love of superb suburban women are going to love me you know why because they want security they want safety and they don't want a regulation that's going to destroy suburbia that's all that's all because they said he's not doing well with suburban women i said what about suburban men how am i doing well there you're doing okay you're doing well with the men not the women but biden has vowed to abolish fracking right he says we're going to not frack anymore he has no he has no idea what it means we are not no fossil fuels no nothing we're going to close down all our factories we're going to go with wind wind wind is going to be the answer kills all our birds everything else we're going to have massive blackouts like they have in california the whole country you ever see the brownouts crippling power outages 700 000 ohio jobs would be destroyed biden lies about a lot of things he lied about that he lied about social security you saw that social security he also won't tell you the truth about decades-long quests he had a decades-long quest to renegotiate social security and medicare and he said he didn't do it or we have a tape here someplace do we have the tape i hope it works better than the big ten tape okay play both videos so we have one real quick we have i only do this for you never said i oppose frackie you said it on tape i did show the tape put it on your website i'll put it on would there be any place for fossil fuels including coal and fracking in the biden administration turn it up no we would we would work it out we would make sure it's eliminated what about say stopping cracking and stopping pipeline and restructuring no new fracking you gotta transition away from it look you're to ban fracking all across america right now right i would love to yeah i'd love to too i'd love to make sure we don't can't use any oil or gas period i guarantee i guarantee we're [Applause] have you been on the floor of the senate you were in the center for a few years yeah time and time again talking about the necessity with pride about cutting social security cutting medicare cutting veterans programs no you never said that no when i argued that we should freeze federal spending i meant social security as well i meant medicare and medicaid i'm not veterans man i'm at every single solitary thing in the government look here's the door an honest guy why don't you just tell the truth here we all make mistakes i am telling the truth and i not only tried it once i tried it twice i tried it the third time and i tried it a fourth time joe let me repeat it again i want you just to be straight with the american people i am saying that you have been on the floor of the senate time and time again talking about the need to cut social security medicare and veterans programs is that true or is that no it's not true that is not true that is not true i'm not veteran's man i meant every single solitary thing in the government everything was on the table i did not support any of those cuts in social security or in veterans oh whoa whoa everything was on the table all right you're right you just said it including in your judgment cuts the social security and veterans in order to get the kinds of changes we need on other things relate joel thank you but we did not cut it i know because people like me helped stop that all that i would say to the american people go to youtube it's all over the place joe said it many many times i'm surprised you know you can defend that or change your mind on it but you can't deny the reality we're starting to use this very expensive means of communication because it's so much easier than my explaining it so number one he said there'll be no fracking no fracking no fracking he luckily gets the nomination because elizabeth warren stayed in for an extra three days right if she would have left before super tuesday he wouldn't have won one stay and he would have been out and then i would have been competing against crazy bernie instead which is okay i don't care well there would have been more energy i mean you know there would have been a lot more no bernie has more energy smaller little face maybe but they have a lot of energy thick you know they're coming to us because a lot of them they agree with me so much on trade we got a lot of them last time but anyway so no fracking then he goes to pennsylvania great place and he says uh yeah you're gonna have fracking a million jobs and you know they want to keep their bills down right the lighting bills and the gasoline so all of a sudden he goes from no fracking to we will frack and everyone said how the hell and the fake news doesn't call him out on it they don't even talk to him about it so i bring it up because that's good it's expensive to do but you know what it's worth it for the great state of ohio all right then then we hear about medicare and social security so all my life i've heard if you even touch social security you're out of politics this guy tried to destroy social security and medicare and bernie caught him i'd like to thank bernie very much you know bernie is honestly he's a good sport he's one of the greatest losers in the history of politics because seriously he lost viciously with hillary and possibly shouldn't i mean i think she sort of beat him but he was treated very badly and then this time he should have won except that she said i mean what they did they quadruple teamed him and what they did to him was incredible and he's got no hard feelings you know he just goes back bernie is the loser i mean i've never seen a guy like this he loves to lose some people love to lose some people as long as i'm your president i will always protect medicare and social security like i promised and he won't and he won't and america will continue to be the number one producer of oil and natural gas anywhere in the world you don't have to worry about me with your ohio fracking you've fractured your heart's content by the way and it's not up to him just so you understand no it's not up to him he switched but his party is not going to let him frack okay they're not going to let him crack and he's got no his party and he's probably not going to be in there too long anyway you know they've got the dream they've got this kamala who is the most liberal person and she said there will never be fracking now she's saying well i think we can live with it no no no go with what they say first in politics go with what they say that's where they come from and they don't have a choice she doesn't either there's not going to be fracking if they win there's going to be a lot of bad things happen like socialized medicine like a lot of it a lot of bad things are going to happen joe biden has made a corrupt bargain in exchange for his party's nomination he has handed control of his party over to the socialists i hate to say this the communists the marxists and the left-wing extremists that you see running up and down the street doing tremendous damage in portland and various places that we could stop and antifa you're right auntie i said joe tell us about antifa joe oh that's just an idea really when you get hit over the head with a baseball bat that's not an idea no he doesn't want to talk about antifa i said joe i haven't been endorsed by almost every law enforcement group in the country almost everyone sheriffs police new york city's finest they've taken all of that you know great vim and that enthusiasm what they've done in new york is terrible all run by democrats all run by radical left democrats or even democrats you look at what's happened to new york crimeways you look at what happened to chicago look at portland look at portland look at oakland look at baltimore by the way you know obama talks like his administration he had stuff how about baltimore how about oakland how about ferguson how about st louis what he what he had and it's like i said that's why i'm here i'm here because people were not happy [Applause] they're running a slate of the most radical candidates in american history they are running the most radical people aoc plus three asc how about aoc how about in minnesota beautiful minnesota omar il ilhan omar [Music] but she's always complaining about the way we run our country no i think we're going to win you know minnesota hasn't been won by a republican since 1972 does anybody know that i think we're going to win minnesota first of all we did a very good job with minneapolis you know that national guard went in no they should have called them two weeks they have we have to get a call we're not allowed to send them unless we want to do something much tougher than that which you don't want to do but we have to get a call so we get a call but the national guard went in in half an hour the whole thing wasn't that a beautiful to me it was a beautiful sight boom boom to me it was a beautiful sight they lined up and they just started walking and that was the end of that they should have been called a week and a half earlier they could have saved a lot of a lot of people and a lot of buildings and a lot of area if biden wins the flag burning rioters on the streets will be running your federal government you know i signed into law when the statues were coming down the monuments and at first they were monuments of people we never heard of and then they were and i said you know what you let them get away they'll be wanting to take down monuments of george washington everyone laughed they thought it was funny i said i'm not kidding and they did if i weren't president you would have monuments taken down all over the city of lincoln of washington of jefferson they were going for the jefferson memorial can you believe this and we have a mayor in d.c who formed a commission with recommendations her recommendation is take down the washington monument close up the lincoln monument no no these are serious you you read about it i said no thank you no thank you no thank you madam mayor we're going to keep the washington monument just the way it is these people these people are crazy you know i went to mount rushmore made a speech everybody i don't know if you saw my sweets but people liked my mountain retro but you know why they liked it because it was so beautiful and behind me were these massive this mountain that's carved so beautifully it's beautiful south dakota beautiful and i'm making a speech and then i realized they want to take down mount rushmore no it's not happening by the way don't tell that to the people don't tell that to the people of south dakota they're not going to be but these people so you know so what i when i saw the thing with the statues and with the monuments all over the country i said we need a strong we need a strong strong law not with this congress we have now where you know one day would be too much and we took out an old law and it says 10 years in prison if you knock down a monument [Applause] and i reinstituted i reenacted it i signed it and they were coming in washington they wanted to knock down quite a few of our beautiful monuments including one of abraham lincoln and you remember jackson they had the ropes but the police went and did a great job they did a phenomenal job they went in these police they went in they were unbelievable that's true remember they had the ropes they were ready they were starting to pull it and the police and they're pretty rough guys but the police went in and they're much rougher it was over so fast it was over so fast andrew jackson who was a great general and a good president maybe a very good president take it down andrew jackson a great battle of new orleans a great general and a very good president they want beautiful right opposite the white house they wanted to pull it down they were ready and the police went in and the police did a great job they did a great job but i said we need something so we signed something that says 10 years and you know they were going to march the following day they were going to have thousands of people come to rip down statues in washington and we inform them it's 10 years in jail 10 years in prison they actually use the term prison because it's a tougher term right it's in prison today they don't use that term today they use much nicer terms it says 10 years in prison if you knock down a monument do anything to damage a monument or a statue so what happened is they heard about it and they came in there were only 24 people supposed to be tens of thousands 24 people and they looked around and the 24 people said let's get the hell out of here 10 years and that was the end that was the end of it it's amazing it's amazing what the what the pen can do right the pen but you couldn't go to congress today and get that because they don't think this way you know today they don't think today they say well you have to have it's freedom of speech knocking down the status it's freedom of speech you can let them do whatever they want to can't do that can't do that so it's uh the federal government's been doing a great job now the state governments have to get tougher and the state governments have to call in the federal government when they have a problem it's very simple the mayor is right they could use some help the first thing they'll do if they win this office and i don't think it's going to happen based on everything i'm seeing is they're going to pack the supreme court with far left judges who will eliminate your second amendment and if if you happen to be pro-life you can forget that you can forget that they will change they will change everything they will change it you know we took our time i have three supreme court justices we have a great one come and a great one three great ones you know many presidents have had none think of it and me their worst nightmare has three their heads are exploding you know the express no but just of equal importance in my opinion by the time by the end of my first term we'll have 300 give or take a little bit 300 federal judges including court over here a record it's a record no it's a record so think of that 300 federal judges i think close to 60 court of appeals judges and three supreme court justices i mean can you believe it even i can't believe it even though it's a record if i don't sound like a typical washington politician it's because i'm not a politician and if i don't always play by the rules of the washington establishment it's because i was elected to fight for you and i am fighting for you harder than any president has ever fought so we're joined today by a couple of our good friends state auditor keith faber where's keith [Applause] thank you so keith has done a great job and uh thank you very much keith for being here we appreciate it that cheering was for you keith i think was that state supreme court justices judy french and sharon kennedy thank you very much congratulations thank you very much thank you very much thank you judge and a person

cities and we are bringing our jobs our factories and our troops back home to the usa our troops are all coming [Applause] back got to fight the deep state all the time no but our troops are all

unemployment and asian american unemployment all reached their lowest levels in the history of our country [Music] [Applause] all unemployment i mean i've seen so many forms of unemployment with a high school diploma without a high school diploma an mba a college degree graduating number one at mit everybody was doing better women doing unbelievably unbelievably breaking every record [Applause] but we had to slow it down close it up save those lives understand this horrible virus that was sent to us by china but sent to the whole world sent to the whole world they stopped it from going into other parts of china but it came to the u.s and europe and all over the world and we can never forget it we can never forget it after the virus hit we've recovered faster than any major nation on earth we've recovered faster economically since april since april we created a record 11.4 million jobs this week i signed an order to protect the pensions of workers of delphi corporation do we have any of those workers here you are so lucky i'm president there's like two people here you are so lucky that i'm president but when general motors went bankrupt biden and obama threw these workers really to the wolves their pensions were totally wiped out their families were left in disarray it was a terrible thing so my order is the first step to restoring the pensions and health care benefits promised to workers in wisconsin michigan and ohio and congratulations and sonata no they were treated very unfairly they were treated and they were promised all sorts of things and then as usual nothing happened i will never let anyone rip off our great american worker we're not going to let them rip it off and they have been doing that for a long time joe biden says buy american but he spent 47 years in washington sending our jobs to foreign countries and you'll also notice he never says hire american did you ever notice that that's because his plan is to hire foreign workers he wants open borders and he wants unlimited illegal aliens coming in we don't know who they are so that leaves no jobs for the americans so we have that straightened all out it's all done don't worry about it don't get upset in fact he's vowed to terminate all of the protections that i've given to the american worker i've given you a lot of protections to save our auto industry i withdrew from the horrible trans-pacific partnership it would have been the worst i ended the nafta nightmare one of the worst trade deals probably the worst right there everyone said that would be it would be impossible to do and proudly signed the brand new usmca into law mexico canada and by the way just kicked in the difference is unbelievable you know how i know it's good because those two countries aren't quite as happy as we are but nafta was a disaster we lost 60 000 factories went to different countries it's terrible it was terrible it was a terrible thing to have signed and everybody said it would be impossible to terminate i terminated it and we have the usmca which is great great for us and it makes it very very tough and the wall is almost complete [Applause] the wall he says build the wall it's a great thing you know they don't talk the press doesn't talk about the wall anymore because it's all built it's going to be very very soon it's going to be completed and it has created such an unbelievable strong border you have no idea and mexico also mexico has given us 27 000. think of that 27 000 soldiers to protect our border i said you have to do it you have to do it because it's not right and we don't have people remember when i came in remember the caravans coming in they were coming and thousands and thousands of people were trying to come and i said you can't do it you don't hear about you don't hear about any of these stories anymore you don't hear about the wall anymore you see what used to be wall wall walk because they never thought i'd get it built you know once you're a developer in new york city this is easy now we got it financed mexico will be paying for it because we're going to charge a fee at the base so it's very simple but they've been great mexico's treated us very well they didn't used to treat it as well but now they treat us well joe biden has vowed that he wants open borders mass amnesty and free health care for all illegal immigrants coming in and that was another tape he had right when they said they had like you know 16 17 of these super radical left people running on the democrat side wasn't so bad i was waiting i was right i could hear that that wasn't that wasn't that bad that's good because you got a lot of people watching you on television you know but remember they said who is going to pay who is going to give health care to illegal immigrants coming into the country and they all raise their hand everybody resides except because he's been doing it for 47 years he knew it was not a good thing so he did the shoulder remember and then he got the hand up i said ah i just won because you can't do you know the problem is look we all have a heart but if you do that you're gonna have tens of millions of people pouring into our country for health care for college for school they want to give free school free education they want to give the new one they want to give free lawyers to everybody that enters our country illegally do you believe that's down in the manifesto with bernie that's between bernie those two characters you saw up there bernie and joe sleepy joe bernie got taken further left can you believe it bernie is supposed to be taken to the right he took joe further left than anything he ever did the manifesto we call it biden's also pledged to terminate all national security travel bans you know i got travel bans if it's okay with you because i didn't like people that want to come in and blow up our country okay so and i got it passed wasn't easy that was not easy that was a bad one that was a tough one they thought i was a bad person no i want people to come into our country who love our country who can help us not people that want to blow up things and kill people but travel bans and increase they want to increase refugees this is an agreement with bernie sanders increased refugees 700 percent opening the floodgates to radical islamic terrorism no thank you no thank you we appreciate it joe thank you very much but no thanks i'm keeping the terrorist jihadist and violent extremists out of our country if that's okay we invested 2.5 trillion dollars in the u.s military including more than 6 billion in contracts oh for lima you know lima the army tank plant lima right you know i did that when i was here that was going to close that plant and i heard that i was president-elect so i had nothing to do for a little while you know there was a little time i didn't know i was being spied on so i had nothing to do and i heard about this tank plant and i had some friends a lot of friends in ohio and they said about this tank plant that they jim jordan the great jim jordan do we love he's one of them you know jim jordan was a great ncaa wrestling champion too he was great it was great jim jordan is a great warrior i will tell you that nobody like him but it's true jim jordan and others they said we have to we have to save this plant i said let me take a look so i actually went to lyman i saw this plant and it's the only plant now that makes army tanks and a level of sophistication you wouldn't believe it and i went through i'm good at this stuff i went through the plant i said if we ever close this plant you'll never be able to get the skill the talent or a facility to do this i'm not gonna buy our tanks from china okay we were close to that in the steel world okay you know let's buy our steel from china no thank you you know there are certain industries we have to have and we brought that back so i said no i'm not going to let this be closed and i stopped it and we are making tanks at a record level all made in the usa we're making it at a record level and and you're right jim jordan was very helpful you would have never been able to replace that plant this big incredible sprawling place and they uh they make these tanks they're so sophisticated you wouldn't believe it when you see i look inside i said no thanks i don't have to go inside i don't need that you know who tried that dukakis that didn't work out i'm slightly larger than him i might have the opposite problem okay and he didn't look good that was not a good picture with him with a helmet does anybody remember dukakis he was up 10 after that picture he was down 15. he went down 20. no i don't have to go into the tank but i did happen to look in and i said that's like a complex machine that's incredible what you do i said we can't close this plant you'll never be able to reproduce this and we didn't close it so you know it's one of a lot of great decisions i think we've made for our military and for the people and also for the people of ohio and we took over 100 of the isis caliphate you saw that syria and for years they were after this blood thirsty killer they were after they could never find it but we found him we killed the leader founder of isis al-baghdadi we killed him [Applause] and then we took out the mass murder of american troops and many other people salamani is dead [Applause] i withdrew from the last administration's disastrous iran nuclear deal one of the dumbest deals and i recognized the true capital of israel and opened the american embassy in jerusalem and instead of never-ending wars you see we just signed yesterday another one sudan so we have bahrain sudan and the united arab emirates red really led by a great leader muhammad a great leader and uh we're getting peace without blood all over the sand it's going to happen we have many other countries that want to come in many other countries want to come into that deal without peace i did more in 47 months than sleepy joe biden did in 47 years that's right a vote for republicans is a vote for safe communities great jobs a limitless future for all americans really it's a vote for the american dream that's what it is we're for the american dream i'm for the american dream the republicans will be with us and in conclusion over the next four years we will make america into the manufacturing superpower of the world we've already started we will end our reliance on china once and for all that's already happened we will hire more police increase penalties for assaults or law enforcement and we will ban deadly sanctuary cities we will uphold religious liberty free speech and the right to keep and bear arms we will strike down terrorists who threaten our citizens and we will keep america out of the ridiculous endless foreign wars if that's okay keep them out we've created the greatest military in the world you know we are the equipment that we bought 2.5 trillion 2.5 that was much easier to get frankly and the democrats didn't want to give anything but that was much easier to get believe it or not than the wall they didn't want the wall they said the wall is old-fashioned they wanted drones flying around so you could watch people pour into our border okay and you know i've been saying it a lot because it's true there are two things that will never get obsolete a wall and a wheel right i said the wall and that wall is it just has stopped but what we've done is we've created two and a half trillion with a t trillion dollars we have the greatest jet fighting planes tankers missiles rockets submarines we have greatest weapon in the world submarines greatest most powerful weapons in the world our nuclear arsenal is fixed and ready and and only hope to god we never have to use it but you know what we're much less likely to have to use it because right now we have things the hydrosonic missiles super i call them the super duper missiles they go seven times the speed of a normal quick missile i mean these things are amazing and you know russia took things that we had during the obama administration from our great scientists and engineers and they built they have hydrosonic but we have hydrosonic now they're the fastest in the world we needed all of this stuff we have the greatest equipment we are the envy of the world whether it's russia china north korea we have the greatest equipment we have the greatest people we have the greatest warriors but our warriors needed the equipment and when i came into office in my first short period of time one of the world's most overrated generals told me sir we don't have ammunition i said that should never be said to another president again and now we have so much ammunition we don't know what to do with it so we have totally rebuilt our military the finest equipment anywhere in the world nothing even closed no other country has anything even close the fake news was said you shouldn't be saying that you're giving confidential information that's okay i'll say it there's nobody can you imagine that they wanted to even call me on that maybe they should impeach me for making that statement okay and we will ensure peace through strength we will end surprise medical bill require the biggest thing there is price transparency remember i said it kicks in on january 1st it's bigger than health care where do you see what you can do when you have transparency where you can negotiate with your doctors your hospitals etc lower drug prices as i said favored nations and even more we will always protect patients with pre-existing conditions always always we will stop the radical indoctrination of our students and restore patriotic education to our schools and we will teach our children to love our country honor our history and always respect our great american flag [Applause] and so importantly we will live by the timeless words of our national motto in god we trust [Applause] amen for years you had a president to apologize for america now you have a president who is standing up for america and standing up for the great people of ohio thank you you know biden used to say that he's made a lot of mistakes because he was never sure where the hell he was right so let's say like that line sort of like maybe a lesser version of it and standing up for the great people of uh florida said no there's no palm trees no he did that about seven times right you know once you do that walk off the stage no matter how good a speech you give it's no good you just walk off the stage standing up for the great people of idaho he had iowa and idaho and he couldn't figure it out this is not what we need for the last four years you have seen me fight for

back PRON job low drug price at a level that nobody be ever lower PRON before and PRON last year for the first time ever drug price go down but PRON be do what be call the favorite nation law the drug company be not happy with PRON this be not suppose to have happen favor nation mean PRON will pay the low price anywhere in the world PRON match PRON favorite nation and nobody be exercise PRON because nobody think of PRON probably but if PRON do think of PRON PRON could not have do PRON because the drug company be so powerful PRON be take PRON see all the ad against PRON PRON be not so much sleepy joe PRON be the drug company because PRON have exercise a favor nation so if germany or another country pay cent for a pill the exact pill and PRON pay two and a half dollar and PRON be talk

here to do a job PRON have the middleman PRON know PRON have the drug pricing be very complicated PRON be very complicated stuff PRON have PRON set so that PRON be almost impossible to disengage PRON and PRON have middleman PRON know the middleman nobody ever hear PRON never say middle woman PRON have never hear middle woman i want to be nice i want to say middle woman but PRON have never hear the term have to do with drug price but PRON have the middleman get million get more than the drug company at least the drug company make the drug right these people do not do anything PRON be very rich i probably know some of PRON i would be not surprise if hunter biden be also a middleman PRON probably get on top of everything else take in million and million now PRON find out that hunter biden be a middleman but these be rich people and PRON get all this money for nothing so i work a deal where canada which buy PRON drug for exactly PRON be go to let PRON governor PRON governor governor florida other governor buy buy PRON drug directly from canada nobody ever do same drug exactly the same same lab same company same everything and PRON be go to buy PRON for percent less and then by that time

155,th-o3RKZvlc,pence,2020-10-29T20:26:14Z,Pence hosts 'Make America Great Again' event in Iowa,speech,what a beautiful day it is great to be here with so many friends especially my great friend and one of the most respected conservative voices in america senator joni ernst also great to be here with your incredible governor kim reynolds and i know senator chuck grassley was here he slipped away but give him a round of applause he is a incredible leader two great candidates for congress and all of you all of you have been with us every step of the way it is great to be back in the hawkeye state you know four years ago you believed we could be strong again you believe we could be prosperous again iowa said yes to president donald trump in 2016 and i know iowa's going to say yes to four more years of president donald trump in 2020 and we are just five days away from a great victory all across iowa and all across america and the road to victory goes straight through the hawkeye state come november 3rd my fellow americans i need you to show one more time that iowa is trump country it really is great to see you all out today thanks for coming out it's great to be here with all of you it really is and it's also great to be here with a couple very special people a daughter of des moines i mentioned before first woman to represent iowa's 67th district in the state house i've been here campaigning with her and i'll tell you what she is going to be a great leader the day she arrives in washington d.c would you join me in thanking the next congresswoman from iowa's first congressional district ashley henson what a great leader also it's great to be here with a seventh generation iowan i served a couple of terms in congress and i had a chance to serve right alongside him and i can tell you he's a man of integrity principle and faith and iowa and america need david young back in the house of representatives you got to do it and finally and finally it is just a great honor for me to be here with someone who i've already described as one of the most respected conservatives in america she's a woman who has iowa running in her veins a combat veteran i'm told the first woman to serve in federal elected office from this state she is a champion for iowa's farmers iowa's family and iowa's conservative values and she has been an unwavering ally of president trump and the maga agenda so right after you re-elect president donald trump for four more years we both need you to send senator joni ernst back to the united states senate for six more years but i want to thank you all for being here today and i came out today to talk about what we've done about the choice that we face in this election and i expect it's why you came out on this blustery day as well i mean think about how far we've come since the time the people of iowa said yes to president donald trump four years ago we inherited a military that had been hollowed out by devastating budget cuts an economy that was struggling to break out of the slowest recovery since the great depression terrorism was on the rise around the world and we witnessed a steady assault on our most cherished values but in three short years we rebuilt our military we revived our economy we secured our border supported law enforcement and stood for life liberty and the constitution of the united states of america and it all starts with our national defense after years of reckless budget cuts and joe biden was vice president and yesterday i just heard that leading democrats in washington are actually already promising massive defense cuts if they somehow regained all of capitol hill in the white house but under president trump i'm proud to report to you as your vice president and as the proud father of a united states marine thanks to the strong support of our allies in congress we're finally giving our soldiers sailors airmen marines and coast guard the resources and the support they need to defend this nation president donald trump has actually signed the largest increase in our national defense since the days of ronald reagan and he actually also made sure that we would continue to be as dominant in space as we are on land and sea and air when he founded the united states space force so it's about standing with those who serve but also standing with all of you who did serve in the uniform you know when joe biden was vice president america saw years of scandal that shocked the conscience of the nation at the va you remember i mean we literally had veterans that were dying on waiting lists waiting to get care at va hospitals but when president trump stepped into the oval office all that changed we signed the most sweeping reforms of the v.a in 50 years we fired more than 3 000 va employees that were not giving our veterans the care that they earned and veterans choice is now available for every veteran in america and that's one more reason why we need a combat veteran on the armed services committee in a republican majority we need six more years of senator joni ernst in the united states senate it's been an incredible champion of our national defense and our veterans and senator we're grateful and on the economy in our first three years after joe biden had tried to tax and spend and bail us back to a growing economy and presided over the slowest recovery in more than 80 years president donald trump created the greatest economy in american history and we're doing it again you might have heard about it with today's new gdp numbers just this morning the american economy grew by more than 33 percent in the third quarter shattering any previous american record the great american comeback is on and with four more years of president donald trump in the white house we're going to bring the american economy back bigger than ever before you know the president said today the third quarter gdp was quote the biggest and best in the history of the country and it was he actually said in his own words not even close he also said and next year will be fantastic with four more years of president donald trump in the white house you know this great american comeback is a testament it's a testament to the character and the resilience and the strength of the american people and it's a tribute to a president and to our allies in the congress who advance the policies that created the greatest economy the world's ever known it's amazing to think now in the midst of a global pandemic joe biden actually wants to raise taxes by four trillion dollars and he wants to pass his own version a two trillion dollar version of the green new deal under president donald trump we cut taxes across the board for working families and small businesses we rolled back more federal red tape than any administration in history we fought for free and fair trade unleashed american energy and in three short years businesses created more than seven million paying jobs including 12 000 jobs right here in the hawkeye state you know it's amazing you think about jobs in the city and on the farm when joe biden was vice president america actually lost 200 000 manufacturing jobs and the last president was asked about it remember it was the summer of 2016. president obama was asked if those jobs were ever coming back and he just said what magic wand do you have that's right we didn't need a magic wand we just needed president donald trump in the white house 500 000 manufacturing jobs created in just three years including 11 000 right here in the state of iowa and when it comes and when it comes to agriculture so important in this state you know iowa reminds me so much of the state of indiana where i'm from this state is many things but in its heart of hearts it's agriculture and when joe biden was vice president we saw taxes being raised on american family farmers we saw regulations that were compromising and eroding the private property rights of farmers we saw them walking away from america's great commitment to ethanol and renewable fuel standards but under president donald trump we cut taxes for family farmers we allowed immediate expensing of equipment on our farms we got rid of the waters of the usa rule restored private property rights for farmers stood with ethanol producers and we repealed the death tax for nearly every family farm in america and on ethanol you all remember president trump came to council bluffs and announced that e-15 is now available year-round that's what we call promises made and promises cap we fought every day to deliver for iowa's farmers that's why i was really pleased today flying out here on air force two when i heard that president trump and i today are actually becoming the first sitting president and vice president in history to be named honorary members of the corn growers association [Music] thank you for that and i promise you we're going to stand with corn growers we're going to stand for ethanol for four more years and you know all the progress that we've made for corn growers and for agriculture couldn't have been possible without the strong support of both of your senators the shy and retiring senator chuck grassley you give chuck grassley a round of applause i'm telling you what he is a champion for iowa and iowa's farmers and it wouldn't have been possible without senator joni ernst in the united states senate and when it comes to trade so important to agriculture you know iowa like where i'm from you do two things well you make things and you grow things and then you sell them to the world when we took office literally half of our trade deficit was with one country communist china joe biden had been a cheerleader for communist china all along the way he literally said that the rise of china was a positive development and he scoffed at the idea that china was even a competitor of the united states but under president donald trump we put china on notice we said the era of economic surrender is over we imposed tariffs on china's goods and when china retaliated against american farmers president trump was there 28 billion dollars in direct support for agriculture and we're going to keep standing strong until china opens their markets to what we grow and what we make and closer to home when it comes to our trading partners to the north and to the south we all remember nafta right i mean the truth is that 25 years after nafta was passed we saw about 60 000 factories that were closed jobs moved south of the border and democrats for years love to complain about nafta didn't they joni but when joe biden was vice president and long before they never lifted a finger to do anything about it even as we saw jobs moving overseas but the man who wrote the art of the deal got a way better deal for america nafta is gone and the usmca is here to stay and it's a win for iowa workers and a win for iowa farmers you know experts tell us that we're actually going to sell 2.2 billion more in agricultural exports to canada and mexico under the usmca with nearly half of iowa's exports going to those two countries usmca is a win for iowa when it comes to jobs in the city and on the farm president trump has been delivering for the people of iowa and we're going to keep right on deliverance for four more years the men and women of iowa we have a choice to make when it comes to this economy and i need you to talk to your neighbors and friends about it over what remains between now and election day i think it's a choice between a trump booming economy and a biden depression you know a recent nonpartisan study came out and said that under joe biden's economic policies america would lose 5 million jobs and the average household income would decline by 6 500 a year so as you're after you leave here today and warm up i want you to find a family member a neighbor or friend that hasn't decided what they're doing yet on november 3rd and i want you to tell them you were out at the airport you ran into mike and he just said he just had one question he wondered it's just easy just one question we see that gdp number this morning we see america coming back getting back on our feet after this great challenging year through which were passed and i just want you to look at them and say no really seriously who do you really think can bring the american economy all the way back ask him who do you really think can bring this economy back bigger and better than ever before a career politician who spent 47 years in washington raising taxes grow in government waiving a white flag of economic surrender on trade or a proven job creator who's overseeing the fastest economic recovery in history so for our families for our future for a great american comeback we need four more years of president donald trump in the white house tell them i said it so it's about jobs it's about our security it's about our prosperity but it's also about the rule of law which is the foundation of our prosperity and i couldn't be more proud to report to each and every one of you as i stand here today president trump has appointed more than 220 conservative men and women to our federal courts at every level including justice neil gorsuch justice brett kavanaugh and justice amy coney barrett i'm telling isn't she something i'll tell you what she did she just did an incredible job we couldn't be more proud of her back in indiana which is where she's from but now she belongs to america and she is going to be justice barrett is going to be an incredible justice on the supreme court of the united states i truly believe it now the progress we've made think about that transforming our judiciary none of that would have been possible i got to say it again without the strong and principled support of both of your senators from the great state of iowa but it is one more reason why we need a principled conservative representing iowa on the senate judiciary committee we need six more years of senator joni ernst in the senate i'm just telling you i'm telling you each and every day the difference that it makes to have allies and to have a republican majority in the united states senate and you know this is really about this is about our liberties we talk about prosperity and we talk about security and those are paramount in our minds but protecting and ensuring our god-given liberties in this country is at the very center of who we are and i want to assure you of a president who's appointed men and women who will uphold those god-given liberties like the freedom of speech the freedom of religion and the second amendment right to keep and bear arms and we're going to keep a point in strong and principled conservatives for four more years as the truth is when you look back at the days when joe biden was vice president our liberties were under assault and our most cherished values i mean when joe biden was vice president we saw the conscience rights of doctors and nurses and religious charities eroded i mean they actually hauled into court a group of catholic nuns to force them to compromise their faith to live under the standards of obamacare president donald trump we've stood strong for the religious freedom of every american of every faith we restored the conscience rights of doctors nurses and religious charities and president donald trump ended the assault on the little sisters of the poor and the supreme court of the united states made it permanent and i just promise you we're going to continue to stand strong for what we cherish most because it matters because it's been the freedom of religion itself has been under ridicule you know i mentioned judge barrett and senator ernst will remember this but two years ago when judge amy coney barrett was being being considered for the court of appeals before the senate she came under attack because of her devout faith in fact hollywood liberals began mocking her faith and the democrat leader on the judiciary committee actually said her faith was a concern because she said the dogma lives loudly within you and hollywood liberals were attacking her faith ever since well i got a message for the democrats in washington and for their friends in hollywood that dogma lives loudly in me that dogma lives loudly in you and the right to live and work and worship according to the dictates of our faith lives loudly in the constitution of the united states of america it's not just been about our liberties it's been about life you all in iowa deserve to know that joe biden and kamala harris support taxpayer funding of abortion all the way up to the moment of birth and they're calling for record increases in funding for abortion at home and abroad but for me i couldn't be more proud to serve as vice president to a president who stands without apology for the sanctity of human life in our first week in office president trump restored the mexico city policy that prevented taxpayer dollars from being used to promote abortion around the world and i got to cast the tie-breaking vote in the united states senate that allowed states like iowa to defund planned parenthood president donald trump is the most pro-life president in american history and we're going to stand for life for four more years so we made great progress in our first three years we rebuilt our military we revived our economy we stood for liberties and life and the rule of law and none of that would have been possible without the strong and consistent support of iowa's republican delegation to congress so right after you reelect president donald trump and right after you send senator joni ernst back to the senate we need you to send david young and ashley henson to a new republican majority in washington d.c and retire nancy pelosi once and for all out i'm telling you david young ashley henson nancy pelosi out that's the equation right so let's get it done ashley thank you so much for running a great campaign it's incredible you know when you look at what we were able to accomplish in those first three years with the support of the people of iowa i think there's only one way you can describe it in three short years we made america great again am i right and then the coronavirus struck from china but before the first documented case anywhere in america president trump did what no president ever done before he suspended all travel from china the second largest economy in the world president trump put the health of america first now you all deserve to know joe biden called that xenophobic he said it was hysterical he actually wrote a couple days earlier that banning any travel during a global pandemic would quote make things worse but joe biden got it wrong and president trump got it right and i can tell you as the head of the white house coronavirus task force president trump's decision to suspend all travel from china saved untold american lives because it bought us invaluable time to stand up the greatest national mobilization since world war ii we reinvented testing we saw to the manufacturing distribution of billions of supplies of ppe we developed medicines known as therapeutics that are saving lives and we are on track to have the first coronavirus vaccine before the end of this year with millions of doses for the american people it's extraordinary and even as we're seeing cases rising in parts of the country people of iowa can be confident that we're going to continue we're going to continue to work around the clock to assure that all of our doctors and nurses have all the support they need to give any iowa family impacted by the coronavirus the level of care we'd want for a member of our family and we'll get through this and we'll get through this together but i have to pause for a second and give some credit where credit is due because all along the way the people of iowa have witnessed the steady strong and compassionate leadership of governor kim reynolds i've worked with governors in all 50 states and our territories and i must tell you that governor reynolds innovation on testing early on the distribution of ppe to doctors and nurses even up to this very hour and moment i'll tell you president and i are grateful and the people of iowa are blessed to have governor kim reynolds in the governor's office at such a time as this let's hear it again for your great governor and the job that she's done incredible leader so working with governor reynolds i promise you we're going to continue to meet this moment we're going to continue to protect the vulnerable save lives and develop life-saving medicines until the day comes when you put this coronavirus in the past and under president donald trump we're opening up america again it's amazing to think with the leadership of your president and the leadership of your governor in just the last five months we've already seen eleven and a half million americans go back to work including nearly a hundred thousand people all across the hawkeye state we're opening up america again you saw in those numbers this morning the american economy is roaring back but you all deserve to know joe biden is talking about shutting down our economy and the headlines today tell us actually that several european countries are already starting to shut down so you can bet that joe biden will lock down the american economy if he ever makes it to the white house but we're not going to let it happen we're going to meet this moment with american compassion and ingenuity we're going to distribute the vaccine and defeat the virus and bring america back bigger and better than ever before so men and women i appreciate you coming out today but i i think you all know the choice in this election has never been clearer the stakes have never been higher i mean iowa knows more than most states about presidential politics the state always plays an outsized role in setting the course of the nation and i i just wanted to come here today to make sure you understand not just what we've done and the choice that we face but the the issues that will face future generations of americans based on what we decide five days from now you know when you look at their agenda higher taxes open borders socialized medicine a green new deal it's clear joe biden would be nothing more than a trojan horse for the radical love now joe biden has said that democracy is on the ballot well i think our economic recovery is on the ballot i think law and order are on the ballot but there are also things far more foundational to our country that are on the ballot in this election i think it's not going to be so much whether america ends up more republican or more democrat more liberal or more conservative more red or more blue i think the choice in this election is whether america remains america it's whether we're gonna we're gonna chart a course for the future for our children and our grandchildren build on our great heritage of faith and family and freedom and patriotism or whether we're going to let joe biden and the radical left surrender our nation to policies that would shut down our economy topple our heritage of freedom abandon traditional values and set us on an inevitable path of socialism and american decline so for everything that has always made this country exceptional and great for our very freedom and way of life men and women of iowa we need to decide right here and right now that joe biden will never be president of the united states we're going to re-elect president donald trump for four more [Music] years you know when the president called me to join this ticket four years ago i really didn't know him that well and some people think we're a little bit different but i gotta tell you we've gotten to be very close friends i've served at his side every day these last four years and i want to tell you folks i've been there when the cameras are off and the klig lights are off i've watched him endure unrelenting resistance and opposition like i've never seen before from the democratic party i've watched this president endure unrelenting and unfair attacks by their allies in the national media but there's not a day gone by that i haven't personally seen president donald trump get up turn his face like flint against the wind and fight to keep the promises that he made to the people of this country now it's our turn to fight for him it's on iowa i need you to bring it i need you to bring it the stakes are that high and it's all down to you it really is so a couple things i want to ask you to do and then i'm going to let you all get in out of the cold but give yourselves a i love these gloved applauses give yourself a gloved applause will you for coming out today i'm just so proud proud to be with you today what a great state thank you all so i got it you got to do a couple of things i checked on my way here early voting's already started so maybe before the day is out i need you to vote iowa vote to re-elect president donald trump for four more years the president cast his vote this weekend karen and i cast our votes in indianapolis so i need you to go get it done i mean if you've already requested an absentee ballot you can vote absentee in person right and i checked on the way here if you don't know where to go with it you can head down to the polk county election office 122nd avenue suite a open today friday saturday and monday 8 to 5. and remember friends don't let friends vote alone bring a family member bring a neighbor bring a co-worker and vote to re-elect president donald trump for four more years so number one i love you too so after you vote with a friend number two i got something else i want to ask you to do i want you to tell somebody why you came and stood out in the cold here today i mean i want you to i want you to tell them that what the stakes are in this election i mean i think this is this is not the most important election in my lifetime i think this might be the most important election in the life of this nation for all the reasons that i said because the choice is that dramatic and as america is standing back up through the most challenging year in my lifetime it's never been more important that we continue to build on the foundation of american greatness so go tell your neighbors and friends you know i'll always believe that what happened here in iowa and across america in 2016 was that you know in a very real sense people weren't listening to the pollsters and the pundits they were just talking to each other it's like i said at the very start people were people were listening to the vision and sensing the leadership qualities of our president and you were talking to your family members and your friends and saying i think that sounds about right i mean you believed that america could be strong again could be prosperous again and so i want you to talk to your neighbors and friends and encourage them one more time because i can tell you joe biden is talking about dark days coming up but under president donald trump the best is yet to come and finally after you be sure to vote tell your neighbors and friends every day the next five days i'd encourage you to do one more thing you know i've traveled around this country the last four years and i'm convinced of two things that america is a freedom-loving nation and america is a nation of faith and so if you're inclined to bow the head and bend the knee from time to time i'd encourage you to do that over the next five days and when you pray pray with confidence in these challenging times that if his people who are called by his name will humble themselves and pray and turn that he'll do like he's always done in the long and storied history of this great nation he'll hear from heaven and he'll heal this land this one nation under god indivisible with liberty and justice for all so pray for america pray for all of the american people it'll make a difference i promise you so thank you for coming out today give your great governor another round of applause will you she not only comes the great leader governor reynolds give ashley hinton another round of applause she's going to be a great member of congress and give a special round of applause to the senator joni ernst who's been such a champion and we're going to get her back for six more years and i'm just

donald trump in and PRON be just five day away from a great victory all across iowa and all across america and the road to victory go straight through the hawkeye state come november rd PRON fellow americans i need PRON to show one more time that iowa be trump country PRON really be great to see PRON all out today thank for come out PRON be great to be here with all of PRON PRON really be and PRON be also great to be here with a couple very special people a daughter of des moines i mention before first woman to represent iowa th district in the state house PRON have be here campaign with PRON and PRON will tell PRON what PRON be go to be a great leader the day PRON arrive in washington d c would PRON join PRON in thank the next congresswoman from iowa first congressional district ashley henson what a great leader also PRON be great to be here with a seventh generation iowan i serve a couple of term in congress and i have a chance to serve right alongside PRON and i can tell PRON PRON be a man of integrity principle and faith and iowa and america need david young back in the house of representatives PRON get to do PRON and finally and finally PRON be just a great honor for PRON to be here with someone who PRON have already describe as one of the most respected conservative in america PRON be a woman who have iowa run in PRON vein a combat veteran PRON be tell the first woman to serve in federal elect office from this state PRON be a champion for iowa farmer iowa family and iowa conservative value and PRON have be an unwavering ally of president trump and the maga agenda so right after PRON re elect president donald trump for four more year PRON both need PRON to send senator joni ernst back to the united states senate for six more year but i want to thank PRON all for be here today and i come out today to talk about what PRON have do about the choice that PRON face in this election and i expect PRON be why PRON come out on this blustery day as well i mean think about how far PRON have come since the time the people of iowa say yes to president donald trump four year ago PRON inherit a military that have be hollow out by devastate budget cut an economy that be struggle to break out of the slow recovery since the great depression terrorism be on the rise around the world and PRON witness a steady assault on PRON most cherished value but in three short year PRON rebuilt PRON military PRON revive PRON economy PRON secure PRON border support law enforcement and stand for life liberty and the constitution of the united states of america and PRON all start with PRON national defense after year of reckless budget cut and joe biden be vice president and yesterday i just hear that lead democrats in washington be actually already promise massive defense cut if PRON somehow regain all of capitol hill in the white house but under president trump PRON be proud to report to PRON as PRON vice president and as the proud father of a united states marine thank to the strong support of PRON ally in congress PRON be finally give PRON soldier sailor airmen marines and coast guard the resource and the support PRON need to defend this nation president donald trump have actually sign the large increase in PRON national defense since the day of ronald reagan and PRON actually also make sure that PRON would continue to be as dominant in space as PRON be on land and sea and air when PRON found the united states space force so PRON be about stand with those who serve but also stand with all of PRON who do serve in the uniform PRON know when joe biden be vice president america see year of scandal that shock the conscience of the nation at the va PRON remember i mean PRON literally have veteran that be die on wait list wait to get care at va hospital but when president trump step into the oval office all that change PRON sign the most sweeping reform of the v a in year PRON fire more than va employee that be not give PRON veteran the care that PRON earn and veteran choice be now available for every veteran in america and that be one more reason why PRON need a combat veteran on the armed services committee in a republican majority PRON need six more year of senator joni ernst in the united states senate PRON be be an incredible champion of PRON national defense and PRON veteran and senator PRON be grateful and on the economy in PRON first three year after joe biden have try to tax and spend and bail PRON back to a grow economy and preside over the slow recovery in more than year president donald trump create the great economy in american history and PRON be do PRON again PRON may have hear about PRON with today new gdp number just this morning the american economy grow by more than percent in the third quarter shatter any previous american record the great american comeback be on and with four more year of president donald trump in the white house PRON be go to bring the american economy back big than ever before PRON know the president say today the third quarter gdp be quote the big and good in the history of the country and PRON be PRON actually say in PRON own word not even close PRON also say and next year will be fantastic with four more year of president donald trump in the white house PRON know this great american comeback be a testament PRON be a testament to the character and the resilience and the strength of the american people and PRON be a tribute to a president and to PRON ally in the congress who advance the policy that create the great economy the world ever know PRON be amazing to think now in the midst of a global pandemic joe biden actually want to raise taxis by four trillion dollar and PRON want to pass PRON own version a two trillion dollar version of the green new deal under president donald trump PRON cut taxis across the board for work family and small business PRON roll back more federal red tape than any administration in history PRON fight for free and fair trade unleash american energy and in three short year business create more than seven million pay job include job right here in the hawkeye state PRON know PRON be amazing PRON think about job in the city and on the farm when joe biden be vice president america actually lose manufacturing job and the last president be ask about PRON remember PRON be the summer of president obama be ask if those job be ever come back and PRON just say what magic wand do PRON have that be right PRON do not need a magic wand PRON just need president donald trump in the white house manufacture job create in just three year include right here in the state of iowa and when PRON come and when PRON come to agriculture so important in this state PRON know iowa remind PRON so much of the state of indiana where PRON be from this state be many thing but in PRON heart of heart PRON be agriculture and when joe biden be vice president PRON see taxis be raise on american family farmer PRON see regulation that be compromise and erode the private property right of farmer PRON see PRON walk away from america great commitment to ethanol and renewable fuel standard but under president donald trump PRON cut taxis for family farmer PRON allow immediate expensing of equipment on PRON farm PRON get rid of the water of the usa rule restore private property right for farmer stand with ethanol producer and PRON repeal the death tax for nearly every family farm in america and on ethanol PRON all remember president trump come to council bluff and announce that e be now available year round that be what PRON call promise make and promise cap PRON fight every day to deliver for iowa farmer that be why i be really pleased today fly out here on air force two when i hear that president trump and i today be actually become the first sit president and vice president in history to be name honorary member of the corn grower association music thank PRON for that and i promise PRON PRON be go to stand with corn grower PRON be go to stand for ethanol for four more year and PRON know all the progress that PRON have make for corn grower and for agriculture could not have be possible without the strong support of both of PRON senator the shy and retire senator chuck grassley PRON give chuck grassley a round of applause PRON be tell PRON what PRON be a champion for iowa and iowa farmer and PRON would not have be possible without senator joni ernst in the united states senate and when PRON come to trade so important to agriculture PRON know iowa like where PRON be from PRON do two thing well PRON make thing and PRON grow thing and then PRON sell PRON to the world when PRON take office literally half of PRON trade deficit be with one country communist china joe biden have be a cheerleader for communist china all along the way PRON literally say that the rise of china be a positive development and PRON scoff at the idea that china be even a competitor of the united states but under president donald trump PRON put china on notice PRON say the era of economic surrender be over PRON impose tariff on china good and when china retaliate against american farmers president trump be there billion dollar in direct support for agriculture and PRON be go to keep stand strong until china open PRON market to what PRON grow and what PRON make and closer to home when PRON come to PRON trading partner to the north and to the south PRON all remember nafta right i mean the truth be that year after nafta be pass PRON see about factory that be close job move south of the border and democrats for year love to complain about nafta do not PRON joni but when joe biden be vice president and long before PRON never lift a finger to do anything about PRON even as PRON see job move overseas but the man who write the art of the deal get a way well deal for america nafta be go and the usmca be here to stay and PRON be a win for iowa worker and a win for iowa farmer PRON know expert tell PRON that PRON be actually go to sell billion more in agricultural export to canada and mexico under the usmca with nearly half of iowa export go to those two country usmca be a win for iowa when PRON come to job in the city and on the farm president trump have be deliver for the people of iowa and PRON be go to keep right on deliverance for four more year the man and woman of iowa PRON have a choice to make when PRON come to this economy and i need PRON to talk to PRON neighbor and friend about PRON over what remain between now and election day i think PRON be a choice between a trump boom economy and a biden depression PRON know a recent nonpartisan study come out and say that under joe biden economic policy america would lose million job and the average household income would decline by a year so as PRON be after PRON leave here today and warm up i want PRON to find a family member a neighbor or friend that have not decide what PRON be do yet on november rd and i want PRON to tell PRON PRON be out at the airport PRON run into mike and PRON just say PRON just have one question PRON wonder PRON be just easy just one question PRON see that gdp number this morning PRON see america come back get back on PRON foot after this great challenging year through which be pass and i just want PRON to look at PRON and say no really seriously who do PRON really think can bring the american economy all the way back ask PRON who do PRON really think can bring this economy back big and well than ever before a career politician who spend year in washington raise taxis grow in government waive a white flag of economic surrender on trade or a prove job creator who be oversee the fast economic recovery in history so for PRON family for PRON future for a great american comeback PRON need four more year of president donald trump in the white house tell PRON i say PRON so PRON be about job PRON be about PRON security PRON be about PRON prosperity but PRON be also about the rule of law which be the foundation of PRON prosperity and i could not be more proud to report to each and every one of PRON as i stand here today president trump have appoint more than conservative man and woman to PRON federal court at every level include justice neil gorsuch justice brett kavanaugh and justice amy coney barrett PRON be tell be not PRON something PRON will tell PRON what PRON do PRON just do an incredible job PRON could not be more proud of PRON back in indiana which be where PRON be from but now PRON belong to america and PRON be go to be justice barrett be go to be an incredible justice on the supreme court of the united states i truly believe PRON now the progress PRON have make think about that transform PRON judiciary none of that would have be possible i get to say PRON again without the strong and principled support of both of PRON senator from the great state of iowa but PRON be one more reason why PRON need a principle conservative representing iowa on the senate judiciary committee PRON need six more year of senator joni ernst in the senate PRON be just tell PRON PRON be tell PRON each and every day the difference that PRON make to have ally and to have a republican majority in the united states senate and PRON know this be really about this be about PRON liberty PRON talk about prosperity and PRON talk about security and those be paramount in PRON mind but protect and ensure PRON god give liberty in this country be at the very center of who PRON be and i want to assure PRON of a president who be appoint man and woman who will uphold those god give liberty like the freedom of speech the freedom of religion and the second amendment right to keep and bear arm and PRON be go to keep a point in strong and principle conservative for four more year as the truth be when PRON look back at the day when joe biden be vice president PRON liberty be under assault and PRON most cherished value i mean when joe biden be vice president PRON see the conscience right of doctor and nurse and religious charity erode i mean PRON actually haul into court a group of catholic nun to force PRON to compromise PRON faith to live under the standard of obamacare president donald trump PRON have stand strong for the religious freedom of every american of every faith PRON restore the conscience right of doctor nurse and religious charity and president donald trump end the assault on the little sister of the poor and the supreme court of the united states make PRON permanent and i just promise PRON PRON be go to continue to stand strong for what PRON cherish most because PRON matter because PRON be be the freedom of religion PRON have be under ridicule PRON know i mention judge barrett and senator ernst will remember this but two year ago when judge amy coney barrett be be be consider for the court of appeal before the senate PRON come under attack because of PRON devout faith in fact hollywood liberal begin mock PRON faith and the democrat leader on the judiciary committee actually say PRON faith be a concern because PRON say the dogma live loudly within PRON and hollywood liberal be attack PRON faith ever since well i get a message for the democrats in washington and for PRON friend in hollywood that dogma live loudly in PRON that dogma live loudly in PRON and the right to live and work and worship accord to the dictate of PRON faith live loudly in the constitution of the united states of america PRON be not just be about PRON liberty PRON be be about life PRON all in iowa deserve to know that joe biden and kamala harris support taxpayer funding of abortion all the way up to the moment of birth and PRON be call for record increase in funding for abortion at home and abroad but for PRON i could not be more proud to serve as vice president to a president who stand without apology for the sanctity of human life in PRON first week in office president trump restore the mexico city policy that prevent taxpayer dollar from be use to promote abortion around the world and i get to cast the tie break vote in the united states senate that allow state like iowa to defund planned parenthood president donald trump be the most pro life president in american history and PRON be go to stand for life for four more year so PRON make great progress in PRON first three year PRON rebuilt PRON military PRON revive PRON economy PRON stand for liberty and life and the rule of law and none of that would have be possible without the strong and consistent support of iowa republican delegation to congress so right after PRON reelect president donald trump and right after PRON send senator joni ernst back to the senate PRON need PRON to send david young and ashley henson to a new republican majority in washington d c and retire nancy pelosi once and for all out PRON be tell PRON david young ashley henson nancy pelosi out that be the equation right so let PRON get PRON do ashley thank PRON so much for run a great campaign PRON be incredible PRON know when PRON look at what PRON be able to accomplish in those first three year with the support of the people of iowa i think there be only one way PRON can describe PRON in three short year PRON make america great again be i right and then the coronavirus strike from china but before the first document case anywhere in america president trump do what no president ever do before PRON suspend all travel from china the second large economy in the world president trump put the health of america first now PRON all deserve to know joe biden call that xenophobic PRON say PRON be hysterical PRON actually write a couple day earlier that ban any travel during a global pandemic would quote make thing bad but joe biden get PRON wrong and president trump get PRON right and i can tell PRON as the head of the white house coronavirus task force president trump decision to suspend all travel from china save untold american life because PRON buy PRON invaluable time to stand up the great national mobilization since world war ii PRON reinvent test PRON see to the manufacture distribution of billion of supply of ppe PRON develop medicine know as therapeutic that be save life and PRON be on track to have the first coronavirus vaccine before the end of this year with million of dose for the american people PRON be extraordinary and even as PRON be see case rise in part of the country people of iowa can be confident that PRON be go to continue PRON be go to continue to work around the clock to assure that all of PRON doctor and nurse have all the support PRON need to give any iowa family impact by the coronavirus the level of care PRON would want for a member of PRON family and PRON will get through this and PRON will get through this together but i have to pause for a second and give some credit where credit be due because all along the way the people of iowa have witness the steady strong and compassionate leadership of governor kim reynolds PRON have work with governor in all state and PRON territory and i must tell PRON that governor reynold innovation on test early on the distribution of ppe to doctor and nurse even up to this very hour and moment PRON will tell PRON president and i be grateful and the people of iowa be bless to have governor kim reynolds in the governor office at such a time as this let PRON hear PRON again for PRON great governor and the job that PRON be do incredible leader so work with governor reynolds i promise PRON PRON be go to continue to meet this moment PRON be go to continue to protect the vulnerable save life and develop life save medicine until the day come when PRON put this coronavirus in the past and under president donald trump PRON be open up america again PRON be amazing to think with the leadership of PRON president and the leadership of PRON governor in just the last five month PRON have already see eleven and a half million americans go back to work include nearly a hundred thousand people all across the hawkeye state PRON be open up america again PRON see in those number this morning the american economy be roar back but PRON all deserve to know joe biden be talk about shut down PRON economy and the headline today tell PRON actually that several european country be already start to shut down so PRON can bet that joe biden will lock down the american economy if PRON ever make PRON to the white house but PRON be not go to let PRON happen PRON be go to meet this moment with american compassion and ingenuity PRON be go to distribute the vaccine and defeat the virus and bring america back big and well than ever before so man and woman i appreciate PRON come out today but i i think PRON all know the choice in this election have never be clear the stake have never be high i mean iowa know more than most state about presidential politic the state always play an outsize role in set the course of the nation and i i just want to come here today to make sure PRON understand not just what PRON have do and the choice that PRON face but the the issue that will face future generation of americans base on what PRON decide five day from now PRON know when PRON look at PRON agenda high taxis open border socialize medicine a green new deal PRON be clear joe biden would be nothing more than a trojan horse for the radical love now joe biden have say that democracy be on the ballot well i think PRON economic recovery be on the ballot i think law and order be on the ballot but there be also thing far more foundational to PRON country that be on the ballot in this election i think PRON be not go to be so much whether america end up more republican or more democrat more liberal or more conservative more red or more blue i think the choice in this election be whether america remain america PRON be whether PRON be go to PRON be go to chart a course for the future for PRON child and PRON grandchild build on PRON great heritage of faith and family and freedom and patriotism or whether PRON be go to let joe biden and the radical left surrender PRON nation to policy that would shut down PRON economy topple PRON heritage of freedom abandon traditional value and set PRON on an inevitable path of socialism and american decline so for everything that have always make this country exceptional and great for PRON very freedom and way of life man and woman of iowa PRON need to decide right here and right now that joe biden will never be president of the united states PRON be go to re elect president donald trump for four more music year PRON know when the president call PRON to join this ticket four year ago i really do not know PRON that well and some people think PRON be a little bit different but i get to tell PRON PRON have get to be very close friend PRON have serve at PRON side every day these last four year and i want to tell PRON folk PRON have be there when the camera be off and the klig light be off PRON have watch PRON endure unrelenting resistance and opposition like PRON have never see before from the democratic party PRON have watch this president endure unrelenting and unfair attack by PRON ally in the national medium but there be not a day go by that i have not personally see president donald trump get up turn PRON face like flint against the wind and fight to keep the promise that PRON make to the people of this country now PRON be PRON turn to fight for PRON PRON be on iowa i need PRON to bring PRON i need PRON to bring PRON the stake be that

because the choice be that dramatic and as america be stand back up through the most challenging year in PRON lifetime PRON be never be more important that PRON continue to build on the foundation of american greatness so go tell PRON neighbor and friend PRON know PRON will always believe that what happen here in iowa and across america in be that PRON know in a very real sense people be not

163,2Bic6wgkm3A,pence,2020-11-02T17:30:59Z,"Pence hosts 'Make America Great Again' event in Latrobe, PA",speech,[Applause] you know it's great to be here with all of you it really is and uh it's also great to share the stage today with uh a doctor joined the navy worked in naval hospitals during the gulf war came home to altoona practiced medicine for 25 years and then he felt a call to public service and i can tell you he has emerged as one of the strongest allies of president trump and our agenda on capitol hill would you all join me in thanking congressman and dr john joyce thank you doc what a great leader you know i know you all are out here the day before election day same reason talk about what we've done talk about the choice that we face one more day but think about the progress four years ago we inherited a military that had been hauled out by devastating blood an economy that was struggling to break out of the worst recovery since the great depression it's true terrorism was on the rise around the world and we witnessed the steady assault our most cherished guys but in three short years we rebuilt our military we revived our economy we secured our border supported law enforcement and stood for life and liberty in the constitution of the united states especially true on the economy you know after joe biden tried to tax [Music] resulting in the slowest recovery in more than 80 president donald trump created the greatest economy in american history and we're doing it again [Applause] i mean how about those new gdp numbers pennsylvania man i mean the american economy grew by 33 in the third quarter shattering every previous record the american comeback is on [Applause] and with four more years of president donald trump in the white house we're going to bring this economy all the way back bigger and better than ever before it's kind of like the president tweeted last week he said it's the biggest and best economy to grow in history not even close you know and this great comeback is a testament a testament to the character and the resilience and the work out of the american people but it's also a tribute to a president and to our allies like john joyce who worked with us to create the greatest economy that's why it's amazing to think here the day before election day the joe biden in the midst of a global pandemic wants to raise taxes by four trillion dollars he wants to pass a two trillion dollar version of the green new deal that would crush american energy but under president donald trump we cut taxes across the board for the working command we roll back more federal red tape than any administration in history we fought for free and fair trade we unleashed american energy and in three short years businesses large and small created seven million good paying jobs including 200 000 jobs right here in the commonwealth know when joe biden was vice president america actually lost 200 000 manufacturing jobs i heard the last president's back out on the campaign trail today remember what he had to say remember what he had to say for you i mean they lost 200 000 manufacturing jobs in the last president joe biden basically said those jobs are never coming back he said he's right he said what magic wand do you have well we didn't need a magic wand we just needed president donald trump in the lineup 500 000 manufacturing jobs created in just three years including 17 000 right here in the keystone state and on the subject of trade it's amazing to think when we took office when this america first president stepped into the white house half of our international trade deficit was with china joe been a cheerleader for communist china all along i mean literally president donald trump stood up to china's seal dumping we imposed tariffs on china's seal and we said the era of economic surrender is over and joe biden never lifted a finger to reform a trade agreement with canada and mexico the democrats used to love to complain about it remember that i overseas i mean after the election day in 2016 i went back to indiana to start packing my bags for washington and i heard that a company that had been in indiana for 75 years was closing their factory and moved to mexico now for years people like joe biden love to complain about now remember but they never lifted a finger to fix it but when the man who wrote the art of the deal got into the oval office america got a way better deal nafta is gone and the usmca is here you know [Applause] you know we had uh i love you people too give yourselves a round of applause you know the topic of trade came up i had a little vice presidential debate out in salt lake city a couple weeks ago [Music] even though it was a huge win for pennsylvania workers and farmers and kyle harris said it didn't go far enough on climate change joe biden's running mate put her radical environmental agenda ahead of pennsylvania jobs and pennsylvania i promise you with four more years of president donald trump on international trade we will always put american jobs and american workers first and on energy so important to pennsylvania jobs in this state are economic vitality joe biden and kamala harris want to crush american energy under a two trillion dollar version of the green new deal it would raise the cost of electricity for every home and every business in america last year joe biden even told a group of coal miners that they should learn [Music] net exporter of energy for the first time in 70 years [Music] but joe biden and caballeros they might be saying something different these days but the truth is both of them spent all most of the last year talking about how they want to ban fracking and abolish fossil fuels i mean banning fracking would destroy hundreds of thousands of jobs in pennsylvania alone they said they were going to do it over and over and over again until he showed up in pittsburgh a few weeks back he said the president wanted to tell the truth i mean literally he said he said our president was lying [Music] and how good did president trump do in that presidential debate am i right anyway you get to the end of that debate [Music] so we've been showing the tapes [Applause] fossil fuels including coal and fracking in the body administration make sure it's eliminated and i think it's critically important on day one that we end any fossil fuels is [Music] [Music] [Applause] would you remember that pennsylvania [Applause] men and women no matter what joe biden is saying right now you can take joe biden and the radical lab are going to try to abolish possible fuels close down the oil industry and ban fracking if they win this election that's why we're not going to let it happen we're gonna re-elect president donald trump for four more years we're gonna have more fracking more american energy and energy independence for generations to come you know you see the choices in this election it's no surprise you all heard about it yesterday for the first time in 50 years the pittsburgh post gazette is endorsing a republican for president they're endorsing president donald trump for four more years wow you know the truth is we have a choice to make pennsylvania always plays an outsized role in presidential politics it's going to be a choice between a trombone depression i mean really there's a study that came out about a week ago that said that under joe biden's economic policies america would lose five million jobs and the average household income would drop by 6500 a year so in all that remains between right now and when the polls close tomorrow i got a question i want you to ask anybody that hasn't made a decision yet okay you can say i'm standing out in the cold mike and karen pence showed up [Music] just ask who do you really think can bring this economy all the way back who do you really think because america is just starting to get back on our feet again who do you really think can make this economy bigger and better than ever before a career politician who served 47 years in washington raising taxes growing government waving the white flag of economic surrender on trade or a proven job creator who's overseeing the fastest economic recovery in american history [Music] [Applause] i mean i'm just telling you you ask them that question and they're gonna if they're honest with you they're gonna have to go you know what you're right so it's about our prosperity that you all know security is the foundation of our prosperity and here in this great patriotic state you all deserve the jobs vice president we saw years of reckless budget cuts in our military and holiday and over the last few days democrats in washington have been speaking openly about their plan to pass massive cuts to defense spending to pay for their big government program you may not know it but the pence is our military family and we're proud of them my son's a united states marine and my son-in-law is a navy pilot currently deployed overseas but more important than that his navy spouse our wonderful daughter charlotte pence bond is with us today would you give her a big round of applause she's an amazing young mom [Applause] we're so proud and i'm proud to report to you as your vice president and as the father and father-in-law two service members and their families under president donald trump we passed the largest increase in our national defense since the days of ronald reagan we are finally giving our soldiers sailors airmen marines and coast guard the resources and the support that they need [Applause] and with that renewed american strength we've stood with our allies as never before and the great news is today our allies are contributing more to our common defenses you know after four previous presidents promised to do it it was president donald trump who kept his word and moved the american embassy to jerusalem [Music] [Applause] and for the first time in 25 years three arab nations have recognized israel's right to exist [Applause] [Music] we've been putting america first standing by our allies that's why it's uh that's why it's such a privilege on this day before election day to be with one of the strongest voices in our administration for our america first policy on the world state he was our ambassador to germany to help he served on our cabinet as the acting director of national intelligence he's made america safer and stronger all along the way would you join me in thanking ambassador [Music] [Music] our allies leader without one american casualty and the iranian general customs ceremony is gone you also might have heard on friday night in a daring raid u.s special forces rescued an american taken captive in niger and as the pentagon announced that america is home safe and no u.s personnel were injured in the operation [Applause] you know the armed forces of the united states are the greatest force for good in the history of the world and we're going to make the strongest military in the world stronger still with four more years it's been about standing with our military and their family it's also about standing with you you know when joe biden was vice president america saw years that shot you all remember we literally had veterans that were dying on a waiting [Music] but under president donald trump those days are over we passed the most sweeping reform of the va in 50 years and farron's choice is now available for every veteran in america so support for our military support for our veterans it's one more reason why we need pennsylvania to send a decorated combat veteran a man who loves this country and will fight to keep america safe to the congress of the united states with john joyce we need to send sean parnell to washington d.c [Applause] so it's been about standing for a safe american under president donald trump it's also been about standing for law and order and we have stood every day with the men and women who serve on the thin blue line of law enforcement and we always will [Music] the president men and women who serve in law enforcement are some of the best people in this country and they deserve the respect of every american every day i want to give a round of applause [Applause] now the president and i will always support the right of americans to peaceful protest riding and looting like you saw again in philadelphia [Music] those who do these things who do violence against our citizens or property or law enforcement will not be tolerated and they will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of all now for years or for months earlier this year as we saw cities across the country burning i mean joe biden has said that america kamala is both said again and again that they believe police officers in this country have an implicit violence against minority when job was asked to be cut funding to law enforcement he said yes absolutely and conor harris recently praised the mayor of los angeles for cutting 150 million dollars out of the lapd let me make you a promise with four more years of president donald trump and the white house we're going to back the balloon we're not going to defund the police not now not ever and we're going to have law and order in every city in every state in this nation for every american of every race and creed and color so it's been all standard for law and order with those who protect and serve it's also been about strengthening the rule of law as i stand here today because of the support of the people of pennsylvania i'm proud to report we've already seen more than 220 principled conservatives appointed to our federal courts at every level and they are all men and women who will uphold the god-given liberties enshrined in our constitution like the freedom of religion the freedom of speech and the second amendment right to keep and bear arms [Applause] 220 judges and that includes justice neil gorsuch justice brett kavanaugh and justice [Applause] [Music] really hasn't been about it's been about appointing men and women who will hold all of our liberties we stand for the values that make pennsylvania and america great and i have to tell you as i stand here today i couldn't be more proud to serve alongside a president who stands without apology for the sanctity of human life [Music] president trump is the most pro-life president you know i truly do believe i think you know standing out here america is more republican more liberal and more conservative i think the choice in this election is whether it's built on our american heritage of faith and freedom and patriotism and all the god-given liberties enshrined in our constitution or whether we're going to let joe biden and the democratic party surrender our country to the radical left shut down our economy and topple our heritage of freedom i truly do believe that's a choice just make no mistake about it we've been through a challenging year i mean for all the progress we made in those first three years rebuilding our military reviving our economy strengthening the foundation then 2020 and the coronavirus struck from china but all along the way the people of pennsylvania have seen this president's leadership before the first case of community spreads struck anywhere in america president trump did what no american president had ever done he shut down all travel from china he put the health of america first now joe biden called that xenophobic essentially said it was racist he said that shutting down travel during a global pandemic would actually make things worse but joe biden got it wrong president donald trump got it right i mean president trump's action shutting down travel from china bought us invaluable time to stand up the greatest national mobilization since world war ii and saved untold american lives we reinvented testing we saw the manufacturing distribution of billions of supplies and the president's secured support with the support of congressman john joyce direct payments to families across this state and nation support for small businesses a paycheck protection program to save 15 million american jobs it's true and i want to promise you as we're every day one day closer to having a safe vaccine we believe we'll have a safe vaccine for the coronavirus before the end of this year with tens of millions of doses but i promise you we're going to continue to make sure that every american family and every community has the resources and supplies for our doctors and nurses to give anyone the level of care they need we're going to work every day to get that vaccine to put this pandemic in the past and we're going to open up america again and we're going to keep america you know you all deserve to know just at a time that america is coming back eleven and a half million americans have already gone back to work in the last five months six hundred thousand people have gone back to work right here in pennsylvania [Applause] joe biden's actually talking about shutting down the economy another one of his surrogates on tv over the weekend everything's on the table let me tell you something president donald trump and i are going to keep opening up america again [Music] we're going to have a vaccine we're going to defeat the virus and bring america back bigger and better than ever before [Applause] i mean it really is a choice that we face it's a choice between a future built on our highest ideals and build on a president that believes in the boundless capacity of the american people to overcome any challenge and joe biden and the democratic party driven by the radical left will take our nation somewhere [Music] we know the best days are yet to come [Applause] so men and women i got three things to ask you to do and then i'm gonna let you get in from the call and give yourselves another round of applause i gotta tell you this is the hardest part [Applause] you all are awesome but first and foremost before the polls close tomorrow if you haven't done so already we need you to vote pennsylvania vote to re-elect president donald trump for four more years i actually checked on the way here you can actually drop off your ballot if you have before the day is over and then go work the polls tomorrow if you don't know where you can go to westmoreland county election bureau to north main street sweep 109 in greensburg and remember friends don't let friends vote alone bring a family member bring a neighbor bring a co-worker and vote to re-elect president donald trump for four more years [Applause] secondly after you vote with a friend either drop it off today or vote tomorrow i want you to tell somebody why you came out here and stood in the cold i can see that resilience in your face we love you well i know why you're out here today karen and i are humbled by your support but you know i don't know if you saw the president and i run 60 minutes about a week ago this wasn't exactly a friendly interview but are they ever i don't even know what that is anyway there was a moment in that interview that i'll never forget the reporter looks at president trump and says how would you describe your supporters and without any hesitation the president said something i'll never forget she said how would you describe your supporters and he looked at her and leaned forward and said they are people who love our country so go tell your neighbors and friends you are here because you love america and we need four more years of a president who loves our country as [Applause] well finally in these challenging times where it seems like if you watch television or see the polls it seems like there's more that divides us than ever before in my lifetime i have to tell you having traveled all across this country over the last four years as karen and i have i'm more convinced than ever that this is a freedom-loving country and i'm more convinced that this is a nation of i faith believe [Music] [Applause] i mean everywhere the president and i go it's not a day going by that somebody doesn't say to me say to my wife i'm praying for you the sweetest words we ever heard and so i want to say to all of you here who are inclined to bow the head and bend the knee from time to time next day and a half a good time to do that too and when you pray pray with confidence karen and i just read that verse in our devotions this morning that we should approach the throne of grace but we claim those ancient words that americans have clung to in much more challenging time that if his people who are called by his name will humble themselves and pray that he'll do like he's always done in the long and storied history of this country he'll hear from heaven and he'll heal this land [Applause] this one nation under god indivisible with liberty and justice for all so pray for america pray for all the american people it'll make a difference i promise and i leave here today i gotta i gotta run up to erie and then i am meeting up with president trump in the state of michigan tonight we're going to bring it all [Applause] but i'm going to tell him i just saw all you good people here in latrobe and i want [Applause] but men and women the time for speeches is over the time for voting is on [Applause] so i want you to leave here today

that we made these first three years talk about the way this president has led through one of the most challenging years of our lives talk about the choice that we face between a future freedom and a hard turn to the left joe biden in the democratic pride and talk to the people of pennsylvania about the role that people in this state are going to play in setting the course of our nation not just in this election but in this generation but i leave here today with renewed confidence but if all of us do all we need to do in every hour that remains between now and the close of polls here in the keystone state we're going to have a great victory all across pennsylvania and all across america and i promise you with congressman john joyce and sean parnell in a new republican majority with

168,EOKYNSCsMTI,pence,2020-11-03T14:11:37Z,President Trump and VP Pence make final stop in Grand Rapids,speech,hello philadelphia [Applause] man it is good to be back in pennsylvania what beautiful weather we got here a little indian summer you know i know the president spent some time in erie last night and apparently he complained about having to travel here then he cut the event short poor guy i i don't feel that way i love coming to pennsylvania you guys delivered for me twice and i am back here tonight to ask you to deliver the white house for joe biden and kamala harris i want to thank mr philadelphia charlie mack his daughter india marie what an outstanding young lady she was those of you who are fathers and have daughters you know how that feels when when you see your daughters just shining i know a little bit about that and it was great to see representatives brendan boyle mary gay scanlon governor tom wolf attorney general josh shapiro mayor jim kenney philadelphia we got 13 days that's our lucky number right here 13 days until the most important election of our lifetimes you don't have to you don't have to wait for november third to cast your ballot you've got two ways to vote right now number one you can vote early in person through next tuesday how many people anybody here voted early already just if you haven't just go to iwillvote.com pa and find out where you can vote early number two you can vote from home with a mail-in ballot just go to iwillvote.com pa to request your ballot right away and before you send it back pennsylvania's got this thing where you've got to use both envelopes so you've got to read the directions carefully to make sure your vote counts and if you've already voted then you've got to help your friends and family make a plan to vote take them with you if you vote early or if you vote in person on election day because this election requires every single one of us to do our part and what we do these next 13 days will matter for decades to come now the last time i was in philadelphia i was at the constitution center and i was delivering a speech for the democratic national convention this year and i said during that speech i've sat in the oval office with both of the men who are running for president and they are very different people i explained that i never thought donald trump would embrace my vision or continue my policies but i did hope for the sake of the country that he might show some interest in taking the job seriously but it hasn't happened he hasn't shown any interest in doing the work or helping anybody but himself and his friends or treating the presidency like a reality show that he can use to get attention and by the way even then his tv ratings are down so you know that upsets but the thing is this is not a reality show this is reality and the rest of us have had to live with the consequences of him proving himself incapable of taking the job seriously at least 220 000 americans have died more than 100 000 small businesses have closed millions of jobs are gone our proud reputation around the world is in tatters presidents up for re-election usually ask if the country is better off than it was four years ago i'll tell you one thing four years ago you'd be tailgating here at the link instead of watching a speech from your cars the only people truly better off than they were four years ago are the billionaires who got his tax cuts right now as we speak trump won't even extend relief to the millions of families who are having trouble paying the rent or putting food on the table because of this pandemic but he's been doing all right by himself as it turns out this was just reported in the last 48 hours we know that he continues to do business with china because he's got a secret chinese bank account how is that possible how is that possible a secret chinese bank account listen can you imagine if i had a secret chinese bank account when i was running for reelection you think you think my you think fox news might have been a little concerned about that they would have called me beijing barry it is not a great idea to have a president who owes a bunch of money to people overseas that's that's not a good idea i mean of the taxes donald trump pays he may be sending more to foreign governments than he pays in the united states his first year in the white house he only paid 750 dollars in federal income tax listen my first job was at a baskin-robbins when i was 15 years old i think i might have paid more taxes that year working at a dispensing ice cream how is that possible how many people here paid less than that it's possible just possible now that if if you are living high on the hog and you only pay 750 dollars in taxes that maybe just maybe he might not know what working people are going through here in pennsylvania we cannot afford four more years of this philadelphia but the good news is right now you can choose change right now you can vote for my friend joe biden and his running mate kamala harris as the next president and vice president of the united states of america now joe joe's no stranger to he he's a native son scrappy kid from scranton you know him and you know he knows you but let me let me tell you how i came to know him and and how i came to love him 12 years ago when i chose when i chose joe biden as vice president as as my vice presidential running bait i didn't know joe all that well we had served in the senate together but we weren't super close he and i came from different places we came from different generations but i came to admire joe as a man who has learned early on to treat everybody he meets with dignity and respect living by the words his parents taught him no one's better than you joe but you're better than nobody and that empathy that decency that belief that everybody counts that's who joe is that's who he'll be and i can tell you the presidency doesn't change who you are it reveals who you are and joe has shown himself to be a friend of working people for eight years joe was the last one in the room when i faced a big decision he made me a better president and he's got the character and experience to make us a better country and he and kamala are going to be in the fight not for themselves but for every single one of us look i get that this president wants full credit for the economy he inherited and zero blame for the pandemic that he ignored but you know what the job doesn't work that way tweeting at the television doesn't fix things making stuff up doesn't make people's lives better you've got to have a plan you've got to put in the work and along with the experience to get things done joe biden has concrete plans and policies that will turn our vision of a better fairer stronger country into a reality literally left this white house a pandemic playbook that would have shown them how to respond before the virus reached our shores they probably used it to i don't know prop up a wobbly table somewhere we don't know where that playbook went eight months into this pandemic cases are rising again across this country donald trump isn't suddenly going to protect all of us he can't even take the basic steps to protect himself just last night he complained up in erie that the pandemic made him go back to work i'm quoting here he was he was upset that the pandemics made him go back to work if he'd actually been working the whole time it never would have gotten this bad so look here's the truth i want to be honest here this pandemic would have been challenging for any president but this idea that somehow this white house has done anything but completely screw this up is just not true i'll give you a very specific example korea identified its first case at the same time that the united states did at the same time their per capita death toll is just 1.3 percent of what ours is in canada it's just 39 percent of what ours is other countries are still struggling with the pandemic but they're not doing as bad as we are because they've got a government that's actually been paying attention and that means lives lost and that means an economy that doesn't work and just yesterday when asked if he'd do anything differently trump said not much really not much nothing you can think of that could have helped some people keep their loved ones alive so joe's not going to screw up testing he's not going to call scientists idiots he's not going to host a super spreader event at the white house joe will get this pandemic under control with a plan to make testing free and widely available to get a vaccine to every american cost free and to make sure our front line heroes never ask other countries for the equipment they need his plan will guarantee paid sick leave for workers and parents affected by the pandemic and make sure that the small businesses that hold our communities together and employ millions of americans can reopen safely you know donald donald trump likes to claim he built this economy but america created 1.5 million more jobs in the last three years of the obama biden administration than in the first three years of the trump pence administration how you figure that and that was before he could blame the pandemic now he did inherit the longest streak of job growth in american history but just like everything else he inherited he messed it up the economic damage he inflicted by botching the pandemic response means he will be the first president since herbert hoover to actually lose jobs joe's got a plan to create 10 million good clean energy jobs as part of a historic two trillion dollar investment to fight climate change to secure environmental justice and he'll pay he'll pay for it by rolling back that tax cut for billionaires and joe sees this moment not just as a chance to get back to where we were but to finally make long overdue changes so that our economy actually makes life a little easier for everybody the waitress trying to raise her kid on her own the student trying to figure out how to pay for next semester's classes the shift worker who's always on the edge of getting laid off the cancer survivor who's worried about her pre-existing conditions protections being taken away let me tell you saying pennsylvania this i know to be true joe and kamala will protect your health care and expand medicare and make insurance more affordable for everybody you know republicans love to say right before an election that they'll protect your pre-existing conditions now joe and i actually protected your policies to make sure people with pre-existing conditions could get health insurance and have coverage we did it through something called the affordable care act aka obamacare and republicans tried to repeal or undermine it more than 60 times and when they've been asked about they they keep on promising we're going to have a great replacement they said it's coming it's been coming in two weeks for the last 10 years where is it where is this great plan to replace obamacare they've had 10 years to do it there is no plan they've never had one instead they've attacked the affordable care act at every turn driving up costs driving up the uninsured now they're trying to dismantle your care in the supreme court as we speak as quickly as they can in the middle of a pandemic with nothing but empty promises to take its place it's shameful the idea that you would take health care away from people at the very moment where people need it most what is the logic of that there is no logic joe knows that a first the first job of a president is to keep us safe from all threats foreign domestic or microscopic when the daily intelligence briefings flash warning signs about a virus a president can't ignore him he can't be awol just like when russia puts bounties on the heads of our soldiers in afghanistan the commander-in-chief can't be missing an action i i can tell you this joe biden would never call the men and women of our military suckers or losers who does that he knows these these heroes are somebody's children somebody's spouse somebody's dad or mom he understands that and he's going to restore our standing in the world because he knows that america's true strength comes from setting an example that the world wants to follow a nation that stands with democracy not dictators a nation that can mobilize and inspire others to overcome threats like climate change and terrorism and poverty and disease and with joe and kamala at the helm you're not going to have to think about the crazy things they said every day and that's worth a lot you're not going to have to argue about them every day [Music] it just won't be so exhausting you you might be able to have a thanksgiving dinner without having an argument you'll be able to go about your lives knowing that the president is not going to retweet conspiracy theories about secret cabals running the world or or that navy seals didn't actually kill bin laden think about that the president of the united states retweeted that imagine what what we're not going to have a president that goes out of his way to insult anybody who doesn't support him or or threaten them with jail that's not normal presidential behavior we wouldn't tolerate it from a high school principal we wouldn't tolerate it from a coach we wouldn't tolerate it from a co-worker we we wouldn't tolerate it in our own family except for maybe crazy uncle somewhere you know yeah he's he's i mean we why would we expect and ex accept this from the president of the united states and how why are folks making excuses for that oh well that's just that's just him no it's no there are consequences to these actions they embolden other people to be cruel and divisive and racist and it frays the fabric of our society and it affects how our children see things and it affects the ways that our families get along it affects how the world looks at america that behavior matters character matters and by the way while he's doing all that it distracts all of us from the truly destructive actions that his appointees are doing all across the government actions that affect your lives you know the environmental protection agency that's supposed to protect our air and our water is right now run by an energy lobbyist that gives polluters free rain to dump unlimited poison into our air and water the labor department that's supposed to protect workers and their rights right now it's run by a corporate lobbyist who's declared war on workers guts protections to to keep essential folks safe during a pandemic makes it easier for big corporations to shortchange them on their wages the interior department that's supposed to protect our public lands and wild spaces our wildlife and our wilderness and right now that's run by an oil lobbyist who's determined to sell them to the highest bidder you've got the education department that's supposed to give every kid a chance and that's run by a billionaire who guts rules designed to protect students from getting ripped off by for-profit colleges and stiff-arm students looking for loan relief in the middle of an economic collapse i mean the person who runs medicaid right now is doing their best to kick people off of medicaid instead of signing them up for medicaid come on when joe and kamala are in charge they're not going to surround themselves with hacks and lobbyists but they're going to appoint qualified public servants who actually care about looking out for you for your job for your family for your health for your security for your planet and that more than anything is what separates them from their opponents they actually care about every american including the ones that don't agree with them and they're going to fight for you every day they care about you and they care about this democracy they believe in a democracy the right to vote is sacred and that we shouldn't be making people wait in line for 10 hours to cast their ballot we should be making it easier for everybody to vote they believe that no one especially the president is above the law they understand that protest on behalf of social justice isn't un-american that's the most american thing there is that's how this country was founded protesting injustice they understand we don't threaten our political opponents threatening to throw them in jail just because we disagree with them they understand that our ability to work together to solve big problems like a pandemic depends more than on just photo ops it depends on actually learning the facts and following the science and not just making stuff up whenever it's convenient we our democracy is not going to work if the people who are supposed to be our leaders lie every day and just make things up i mean and we've just become numb to it we just become immune to it every single day fact checkers can't keep up and and and look this this notion of truthfulness and democracy and and citizenship and being responsible these aren't republican or democratic principles they're american principles they're what we're they're what we most of us grew up learning from our parents and our grandparents they're not white or black or latino or asian values their american values human values and we need to reclaim them we have to get those values back at the center of our public life and we can but but to do it we've got to turn out like never before we cannot leave any doubt in this election because you know he the president's already said if this is even close i'm going to just make stuff up he's already started to do it so we can't have any doubt we can't be complacent i don't care about the polls there were a whole bunch of polls last time didn't work out because a whole bunch of folks stayed at home and got lazy and complacent not this time not in this election not this side listen listen i i understand why a lot of americans can get frustrated by government and can feel like it doesn't make a difference even supporters of mine during my eight years there were times where stuff we wanted to get done didn't get done and people said well you know gosh if if obama didn't get it done then you know maybe it's just not going to happen look government is not going to solve every problem it's true every elected official is going to make some mistakes this is a big complicated country and the system's designed so that change happens slowly it doesn't happen overnight and and believe me i've got first-hand experience with the way republicans in congress abuse the rules to make it easy for special interest to stop progress but we can make things better and we sh we sure shouldn't be making things worse a president by himself can't solve every challenge in a global economy but if we've got joe biden and kamala harris in the white house and a house and senate that are focused on working people it can make a difference and get millions of people the help they need a president by himself can't eliminate all racial bias in our criminal justice system but if we've got district attorneys and states attorneys and sheriffs and police chiefs focused on equality and justice it can make things better in pennsylvania you just got to flip nine seats in your state house just five seats in your state senate to give democrats control and new life for policies they'll make a real difference to working families right now it can make things better and and it in the end pennsylvania that's what voting is about making things better not making things perfect but putting us on track so that a generation from now we can look back and say things got better starting now and that's what's voting's about voting is about using the power we have and pooling it together to get a government that's more concerned and more responsive and more focused on you and your lives and your children and your grandchildren and future generations and the fact that we don't get 100 of what we want right away is not a good reason not to vote it means we've got to vote and then get some change and then vote some more and then get some more change and then keep on voting until we get it right and we will never come close to seeing what it would be like if everybody voted when i hear people saying well i i don't know your vote don't make a difference we don't know because usually no more than half the people who could be voting vote we get 50 55 percent of people voting and then people say oh look you know not enough change happened well imagine what would happen at 60 percent voted what about 70 percent imagine january 20th when we swear in a president and a vice president who have a plan to get us out of this mess who believe in science and have a plan to protect this planet for our kids and who care about working americans and have a plan to help you start getting ahead and who believe in racial equality and gender equality and and believe in not discriminating against people because of their sexual orientation and are willing to bring us closer to an america where no matter what we look like and where we come from and who we love and what our last name is if we go out there and we work we can make it and we're part of an american family all of that is possible all of that is within our reach if we vote because let me tell you something pennsylvania some people ask me sometimes they say man how have you been able to take these last four years just watching all this how do you how do you keep your spirits up and and i tell them i say look for all the times these last four years that we've seen our worst impulses revealed we've also seen what our country can be at its best we've seen folks of every age and background who've packed city centers and airports in town squares just so families wouldn't be separated so another classroom wouldn't get shot up so our kids wouldn't grow up on an uninhabitable planet we've seen americans of all races joining together to declare in the face of injustice that black lives matter no more but no less so that no child in this country feels the continuing sting of racism we've seen folks our our essential workers our healthcare workers risking their lives day in day out to save somebody else's loved ones we've seen people volunteer and contribute to help those who are having an especially difficult time that right now that's true in pennsylvania that's true all across the country america is a good and decent place but we've just seen so much noise and nonsense that sometimes it's hard for us to remember philadelphia i'm asking you to remember what this country can be what it's like when we treat each other with respect and dignity what it's like when our elected officials actually behave responsibly i'm asking you to believe in joe's ability in kamala's ability to lead this country out of these dark times and help us build it back better because we can't abandon those who are hurting right now we can't abandon the children who aren't getting the education they need right now we can't abandon those protesters who inspired us we've got to channel their activism into action we can't just imagine a better future we've got to fight for it we've got to out hustle the other side we've got to work the other side we've got to vote like never before and leave no doubt so make a plan right now for how you're going to get involved and vote do it as early as you can tell your family tell your friends how they can vote don't stop with joe and kamala make sure you vote all the way down the ticket and if we pour all our efforts into these 13 days if we vote up and down the ticket like never before then we will not only elect joe biden and kamala harris we will also leave no doubt about what this country that we love stands for we will not leave any doubt about who we are as a people and the values and ideals that we embrace what lincoln called the better angels of our nature those are still in us we see him operating every single day we see him in neighborhoods we see him in churches and synagogues and mosques and temples we see him in people helping out a neighbor we see him inside our own families we see that what is best in us is still there but we've got to give it voice and we've got to do it now so let's get to work people let's bring this home i love you philadelphia,b hello philadelphia applause man PRON be good to be back in pennsylvania what beautiful weather PRON get here a little indian summer PRON know i know the president spend some time in

some interest in take the job seriously but PRON have not happen PRON have not show any interest in do the work or help anybody but PRON and PRON friend or treat the presidency like a reality show that PRON can use to get attention and by the way even then PRON tv rating be down so PRON know that upset but the thing be this be not a reality show this be reality and the rest of PRON have have to live with the consequence of PRON prove PRON incapable of take the job seriously at least americans have die more than small business have close million of job be go PRON proud reputation around the world be in tatter president up for re election usually ask if the country be well off than PRON be four year ago PRON will tell PRON one thing four year ago PRON would be tailgate here at the link instead of watch a speech from PRON car the only people truly better off than PRON be four year ago be the billionaire who get PRON tax cut right now as PRON speak trump will not even extend relief to the million of family who be have trouble pay the rent or put food on the table because of this pandemic but PRON be be do all right by PRON as PRON turn out this be just report in the last hour PRON know that PRON continue to do business with china because PRON be get a secret chinese bank account how be that possible how be that possible a secret chinese bank account listen can PRON imagine if i have a secret chinese bank account when i be run for reelection PRON think PRON think PRON PRON think fox news may have be a little concerned about that PRON would have call PRON beijing barry PRON be not a great idea to have a president who owe a bunch of money to people overseas that be that be not a good idea i mean of the taxis donald trump pay PRON may be send more to foreign government than PRON pay in the united states PRON first year in the white house PRON only pay dollar in federal income tax listen PRON first job be at a baskin robbin when i be year old i think i may have pay more taxis that year work at a dispense ice cream how be that possible how many people here pay less than that PRON be possible just possible now that if if PRON be live high on the hog and PRON only pay dollar in taxis that maybe just maybe PRON may not know what work people be go through here in pennsylvania PRON can not afford four more year of this philadelphia but the good news be right now PRON can choose change right now PRON can vote for PRON friend joe biden and PRON running mate kamala harris as the next president and vice president of the united states of america now joe joe no stranger to PRON PRON be a native son scrappy kid from scranton PRON know PRON and PRON know PRON know PRON but let PRON let PRON tell PRON how i come to know PRON and and how i come to love PRON year ago when i choose when i choose joe biden as vice president as as PRON vice presidential run bait i do not know joe all that well PRON have serve in the senate together but PRON be not super close PRON and i come from different place PRON come from different generation but i come to admire joe as a man who have learn early on to treat everybody PRON meet with dignity and respect live by the word PRON parent teach PRON no one be well than PRON joe but PRON be well than nobody and that empathy that decency that belief that everybody count that be who joe be that be who PRON will be and i can tell PRON the presidency do not change who PRON be PRON reveal who PRON be and joe have show PRON to be a friend of work people for eight year joe be the last one in the room when i face a big decision PRON make PRON a well president and PRON be get the character and experience to make PRON a well country and PRON and kamala be go to be in the fight not for PRON but for every single one of PRON look i get that this president want full credit for the economy PRON inherit and zero blame for the pandemic that PRON ignore but PRON know what the job do not work that way tweet at the television do not fix thing make stuff up do not make people life well PRON have get to have a plan PRON have get to put in the work and along with the experience to get thing do joe biden have concrete plan and policy that will turn PRON vision of a better fair strong country into a reality literally leave this white house a pandemic playbook that would have show PRON how to respond before the virus reach PRON shore PRON probably use PRON to i do not know prop up a wobbly table somewhere PRON do not know where that playbook go eight month into this pandemic case be rise again across this country donald trump be not suddenly go to protect all of PRON PRON can not even take the basic step to protect PRON just last night PRON complain up in erie that the pandemic make PRON go back to work PRON be quote here PRON be PRON be upset that the pandemic make PRON go back to work if PRON would actually be work the whole time PRON never would have get this bad so look here be the truth i want to be honest here this pandemic would have be challenge for any president but this idea that somehow this white house have do anything but completely screw this up be just not true PRON will give PRON a very specific example korea identify PRON first case at the same time that the united states do at the same time PRON per capita death toll be just percent of what ours be in canada PRON be just percent of what ours be other country be still struggle with the pandemic but PRON be not do as bad as PRON be because PRON have get a government that be actually be pay attention and that mean life lose and that mean an economy that do not work and just yesterday when ask if PRON would do anything differently trump say not much really not much nothing PRON can think of that could have help some people keep PRON love one alive so joe be not go to screw up test PRON be not go to call scientist idiot PRON be not go to host a super spreader event at the white house joe will get this pandemic under control with a plan to make testing free and widely available to get a vaccine to every american cost free and to make sure PRON front line hero never ask other country for the equipment PRON need PRON plan will guarantee pay sick leave for worker and parent affect by the pandemic and make sure that the small business that hold PRON community together and employ million of americans can reopen safely PRON know donald donald trump like to claim PRON build this economy but america create million more job in the last three year of the obama biden administration than in the first three year of the trump pence administration how PRON figure that and that be before PRON could blame the pandemic now PRON do inherit the long streak of job growth in american history but just like everything else PRON inherit PRON mess PRON up the economic damage PRON inflict by botch the pandemic response mean PRON will be the first president since herbert hoover to actually lose job joe get a plan to create million good clean energy job as part of a historic two trillion dollar investment to fight climate change to secure environmental justice and PRON will pay PRON will pay for PRON by roll back that tax cut for billionaire and joe see this moment not just as a chance to get back to where PRON be but to finally make long overdue change so that PRON economy actually make life a little easy for everybody the waitress try to raise PRON kid on PRON own the student try to figure out how to pay for next semester class the shift worker who be always on the edge of get lay off the cancer survivor who be worried about PRON pre existing condition protection be take away let PRON tell PRON say pennsylvania this i know to be true joe and kamala will protect PRON health care and expand medicare and make insurance more affordable for everybody PRON know republicans love to say right before an election that PRON will protect PRON pre existing condition now joe and i actually protect PRON policy to make sure people with pre existing condition could get health insurance and have coverage PRON do PRON through something call the affordable care act aka obamacare and republicans try to repeal or undermine PRON more than time and when PRON have be ask about PRON PRON keep on promise PRON be go to have a great replacement PRON say PRON be come PRON be be come in two week for the last year where be PRON where be this great plan to replace obamacare PRON have have year to do PRON there be no plan PRON have never have one instead PRON have attack the affordable care act at every turn drive up cost drive up the uninsured now PRON be try to dismantle PRON care in the supreme court as PRON speak as quickly as PRON can in the middle of a pandemic with nothing but empty promise to take PRON place PRON be shameful the idea that PRON would take health care away from people at the very moment where people need PRON most what be the logic of that there be no logic joe know that a first the first job of a president be to keep PRON safe from all threat foreign domestic or microscopic when the daily intelligence briefing flash warning sign about a virus a president can not ignore PRON PRON can not be awol just like when russia put bounty on the head of PRON soldier in afghanistan the commander in chief can not be miss an action i i can tell PRON this joe biden would never call the man and woman of PRON military sucker or loser who do that PRON know these these hero be somebody child somebody spouse somebody dad or mom PRON understand that and PRON be go to restore PRON standing in the world because PRON know that america true strength come from set an example that the world want to follow a nation that stand with democracy not dictator a nation that can mobilize and inspire other to overcome threat like climate change and terrorism and poverty and disease and with joe and kamala at the helm PRON be not go to have to think about the crazy thing PRON say every day and that be worth a lot PRON be not go to have to argue about PRON every day music PRON just will not be so exhausting PRON PRON may be able to have a thanksgiving dinner without have an argument PRON will be able to go about PRON life know that the president be not go to retweet conspiracy theory about secret cabal run the world or or that navy seal do not actually kill bin laden think about that the president of the united states retweete that imagine what what PRON be not go to have a president that go out of PRON way to insult anybody who do not support PRON or or threaten PRON with jail that be not normal presidential behavior PRON would not tolerate PRON from a high school principal PRON would not tolerate PRON from a coach PRON would not tolerate PRON from a co worker PRON PRON would not tolerate PRON in PRON own family except for maybe crazy uncle somewhere PRON know yeah PRON be PRON be i mean PRON why would PRON expect and ex accept this from the president of the united states and how why be folk make excuse for that oh well that be just that be just PRON no PRON be no there be consequence to these action PRON embolden other people to be cruel and divisive and racist and PRON fray the fabric of PRON society and PRON affect how PRON child see thing and PRON affect the way that PRON family get along PRON affect how the world look at america that behavior matter character matter and by the way while PRON be do all that PRON distract all of PRON from the truly destructive action that PRON appointee be do all across the government action that affect PRON life PRON know the environmental protection agency that be suppose to protect PRON air and PRON water be right now run by an energy lobbyist that give polluter free rain to dump unlimited poison into PRON air and water the labor department that be suppose to protect worker and PRON right right now PRON be run by a corporate lobbyist who be declare war on worker gut protection to to keep essential folk safe during a pandemic make PRON easy for big corporation to shortchange PRON on PRON wage the interior department that be suppose to protect PRON public land and wild space PRON wildlife and PRON wilderness and right now that be run by an oil lobbyist who be determined to sell PRON to the high bidder PRON have get the education department that be suppose to give every kid a chance and that be run by a billionaire who gut rule design to protect student from get rip off by for profit college and stiff arm student look for loan relief in the middle of an economic collapse i mean the person who run medicaid right now be do PRON good to kick people off of medicaid instead of sign PRON up for medicaid come on when joe and kamala be in charge PRON be not go to surround PRON with hack and lobbyist but PRON be go to appoint qualified public servant who actually care about look out for PRON for PRON job for PRON family for PRON health for PRON security for PRON planet and that more than anything be what separate PRON from PRON opponent PRON actually care about every american include the one that do not agree with PRON and PRON be go to fight for PRON every day PRON care about PRON and PRON care about this democracy PRON believe in a democracy the right to vote be sacred and that PRON should not be make people wait in line for hour to cast PRON ballot PRON should be make PRON easy for everybody to vote PRON believe that no one especially the president be above the law PRON understand that protest on behalf of social justice be not un american that be the most american thing there be that be how this country be found protest injustice PRON understand PRON do not threaten PRON political opponent threaten to throw PRON in jail just because PRON disagree with PRON PRON understand that PRON ability to work together to solve big problem like a pandemic depend more than on just photo op PRON depend on actually learn the fact and follow the science and not just make stuff up whenever PRON be convenient PRON PRON democracy be not go to work if the people who be suppose to be PRON leader lie every day and just make thing up i mean and PRON have just become numb to PRON PRON just become immune to PRON every single day fact checker can not keep up and and and look this this notion of truthfulness and democracy and and citizenship and be responsible these be not republican or democratic principle PRON be american principle PRON be what PRON be PRON be what PRON most of PRON grow up learn from PRON parent and PRON grandparent PRON be not white or black or latino or asian value PRON american value human value and PRON need to reclaim PRON PRON have to get those value back at the center of PRON public life and PRON can but but to do PRON PRON have get to turn out like never before PRON can not leave any doubt in this election because PRON know PRON the president be already say if this be even close PRON be go to just make stuff up PRON be already start to do PRON so PRON can not have any doubt PRON can not be complacent i do not care about the poll there be a whole bunch of poll last time do not work out because a whole bunch of folk stay at home and get lazy and complacent not this time not in this election not this side listen listen i i understand why a lot of americans can get frustrate by government and can feel like PRON do not make a difference even supporter of mine during PRON eight year there be time where stuff PRON want to get do do not get do and people say well PRON know gosh if if obama do not get PRON do then PRON know maybe PRON be just not go to happen look government be not go to solve every problem PRON be true every elect official be go to make some mistake this be a big complicated country and the system be design so that change happen slowly PRON do not happen overnight and and believe PRON PRON have get first hand experience with the way republicans in congress abuse the rule to make PRON easy for special interest to stop progress but PRON can make thing well and PRON sh PRON sure should not be make thing bad a president by PRON can not solve every challenge in a global economy but if PRON have get joe biden and kamala harris in the white house and a house and senate that be focus on work people PRON can make a difference and get million of people the help PRON need a president by PRON can not eliminate all racial bias in PRON criminal justice system but if PRON have get district attorney and state attorney and sheriff and police chief focus on equality and justice PRON can make thing better in pennsylvania PRON just get to flip nine seat in PRON state house just five seat in PRON state senate to give democrats control and new life for policy PRON will make a real difference to work family right now PRON can make thing well and and PRON in the end pennsylvania that be what voting be about make thing better not make thing perfect but put PRON on track so that a generation from now PRON can look back and say thing get better start now and that be what be vote be about voting be about use the power PRON have and pool PRON together to get a government that be more concerned and more responsive and more focused on PRON and PRON life and PRON child and PRON grandchild and future generation and the fact that PRON do not get of what PRON want right away be not a good reason not to vote PRON mean PRON have get to vote and then get some change and then vote some more and then get some more change and then keep on vote until PRON get PRON right and PRON will never come close to see what PRON would be like if everybody vote when i hear people say well i i do not know PRON vote do not make a difference PRON do not know because usually no more than half the people who could be vote vote PRON get percent of people vote and then people say oh look PRON know not enough change happen well imagine what would happen at percent vote what about percent imagine january th when PRON swear in a president and a vice president who have a plan to get PRON out of this mess who believe in science and have a plan to protect this planet for PRON kid and who care about work americans and have a plan to help PRON start get ahead and who believe in racial equality and gender equality and and believe in not discriminate against people because of PRON sexual orientation and be willing to bring PRON closer to an america where no matter what PRON look like and where PRON come from and who PRON love and what PRON last name be if PRON go out there and PRON work PRON can make PRON and PRON be part of an american family all of that be possible all of that be within PRON reach if PRON vote because let PRON tell PRON something pennsylvania some people ask PRON sometimes PRON say man how have PRON be able to take these last four year just watch all this how do PRON how do PRON keep PRON spirit up and and i tell PRON i say look for all the time these last four year that PRON have see PRON bad impulse reveal PRON have also see what PRON country can be at PRON good PRON have see folk of every age and background who have pack city center and airport in town square just so family would not be separate so another classroom would not get shoot up so PRON kid would not grow up on an uninhabitable planet PRON have see americans of all race join together to declare in the face of injustice that black life matter no more but no less so that no child in this country feel the continue sting of racism PRON have see folk PRON PRON essential worker PRON healthcare worker risk PRON life day in day out to save somebody else love one PRON have see people volunteer and contribute to help those who be have an especially difficult time that right now that be true in pennsylvania that be true all across the country america be a good and decent place but PRON have just see so much noise and nonsense that sometimes PRON be hard for PRON to remember philadelphia PRON be ask PRON to remember what this country can be what PRON be like when PRON treat each other with respect and dignity what PRON be like when PRON elect official actually behave responsibly PRON be ask PRON to believe in joe ability in kamala ability to lead this country out of these dark time and help PRON build PRON back better because PRON can not abandon those who be hurt right now PRON can not abandon the child who be not get the education PRON need right now PRON can not abandon those protester who inspire PRON PRON have get to channel PRON activism into action PRON can not just imagine a well future PRON have get to fight for PRON PRON have get to out hustle the other side PRON have get to work the other side PRON have get to vote like never before and leave no doubt so make a plan right now for how PRON be go to get involve and vote do PRON as early as PRON can tell PRON family tell PRON friend how PRON can vote do not stop with joe and kamala make sure PRON vote all the way down the ticket and if PRON pour all PRON effort into these day if PRON vote up and down the ticket like never before then PRON will not only elect joe biden and kamala harris
